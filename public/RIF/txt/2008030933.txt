The  resolution  directed  the  district’s  superintendent,  or  his  designee,  to  initiate 
procedures  to  not  reemploy  the  equivalent  of  90.2625  full-time  equivalent  certificated 
employees of  the  district  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955, 

2. 

*On  March  12,  2008,  District  Superintendent  Gregg  Haulk  sent  notice  to  87 

certificated  employees  of  his  recommendation  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or 
discontinued  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  Of  those  employees,  81  requested  a  hearing  to 
determine if  there  was  cause  to  not  re-employ  them.  Prior  to  hearing,  12  employees  failed  to 
file  a  notice  of  defense;  three  employees  withdrew  their  request  for  a  hearing;  and  the  district 
withdrew  accusations  against  14  additional  employees.  Four  employees  failed  to  appear  at 
hearing  or  have  representation  at  hearing.  There  remain  48  respondents  in  this  proceeding 
who  are  listed  in  Attachment  A. 

3. 

The  parties  stipulated  that  the  district  has  complied  with  all  procedural 

requirements  of  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955. 

4. 

The  board’s  decision  to  reduce  90.2625  full-time  equivalent  positions  was 
based  on  a  combination  of  four  matters:  (1)  declining  enrollment;  (2)  an  anticipated  loss 
of  revenue  from  the  State  of  California  for  the  2008-2009  school  year;  (3)  closure  of  an 
elementary  school;  and  (4)  changes  in  the  manner  in  which  services  are  provided  by  the 
district. 

Superintendent  Haulk  testified  that  the  district  anticipates  having  approximately  300 
less  students  for  the  2008-2009  school  year,  which  will  have  a  fiscal  impact  on  the  district. 
The  district  has  had  that  amount  of  decline  in  enrollment  in  previous  years,  but  the  district 
has  not  appropriately  addressed  it.  The  district  anticipates  that  it  will  receive  a  $2.1  million 
reduction  in  state  funding,  in  addition  to  losses  in  categorical  and  special  education  funding. 
The  district  is  concerned  that if  the  district  does  not  budget  correctly  for  the  2008-2009 
school  year,  the  state  budgetary  cuts  will  result  in  the  district  being  unable  to  pay  it  bills  and 
lead  to  its  negative  certification.  The  district  is  currently  under  budgetary  oversight  by  the 
Humboldt  County  Office  of  Education. 

The  board  has  made  the  decision  to  close  Lincoln  Elementary  School,  and  to  relocate 
its  children  and  services  to  one  of  the  district’s  four  other  elementary  schools.  The  board  is 
considering  closure  of  another  school  as  well.  The  district  is  also  considering  a  number  of 
alternative,  and  more  cost-effective,  ways  in  which  to  offer  services  to  students.  Among 
the  things  the  board  is  considering  for  the  high  school  is  consolidating  the  courses  offered 
at  the  high  schools,  loading  the  classes,  rather  than  teaching  to  a  small  number  of  students, 
and  reducing  the  types  of  classes  offered  at  the  high  school,  including  building  a  program 
that  teaches  to  high  school  graduation  requirements.'  The  board  is  considering  district 

  

'  The  district  understands  that  if  it  no  longer  offered  the  classes  required  for  admission  into  the 

University  of  California  or  California  State  Universities,  a  large  number  of  students  might  transfer  to 
other  high  schools  in  Humboldt  County,  thereby  worsening  its  financial  circumstances.

reorganization,  closing  additional  schools,  selling  and/or  leasing  surplus  district  property. 
The  board  is  considering  discontinuing  participation  in  the  class  size  reduction  program.  In 
addition  to  nonremployment  of  certificated  staff,  the  district  is  reducing  its  administrative 
and  classified  staff.  Even if  the  district’s  enrollment  had  remained  fixed,  these  avenues 
would  need  to  be  explored  by  reason of  the  district’s  financial  problems. 

_  The  board  has  significant  decisions  to  make  with  respect  to  the  operation  of  the 
district  in  light  of  its  serious  fiscal  circumstances.  The  superintendent  has  planned  for  the 
worst  case  scenario  so  as  to  provide  the  board  and  the  district  with  the  most  flexibility. 
Superintendent  Haulk  is  satisfied  that  the  district  has  retained  a  sufficient  number  of 
certificated staff  to  meet  the  district’s  projected  staffing  needs  for  the  2008-2009  school 
year.  The  district’s  actual  staffing  needs  will  depend  on  the  decisions  made  by  the 
governing  board  as  well  as  actual  student  enrollment. 

5. 

In  determining  the  number  of  teachers  to  be  given  notices,  the  district 

considered  all  attrition  prior  to  March  15,  2008,  that  is  teachers  who  notified  the  district  that 
they  would  be  retiring  or  resigning  at  the  end of  the  school  year.  As  other  teachers  notified 
the  district  of  their  retirements  or  resignations,  the  district  took  those  into  account,  and 
withdrew  a  corresponding  number  of  accusations. 

6. 

Adina  Lawson  is  a  full-time  teacher  at  Eureka  High  School.  She  has  a 

seniority  date  of  September  1,  1999.  Lawson’s  current  assignment  is  teaching  Theater 
(a  Fine  Arts  position)  and  Language  Arts.  The  seniority  list  reflects  that  Lawson  holds  a 
0.8  FTE  Fine  Arts  position  and  0.2  FTE  Language  Arts  position.  The  parties  stipulated  that 
this  is  incorrect.  Lawson  holds  a  0.6  FTE  Fine  Arts  position  and  0.4  FTE  Language  Arts 
position.  As  a  result of  this  error,  the  district  has  not  properly  noticed  respondent of  its 
intent  to  reduce  0.2  FTE  of  the  Language  Arts  position  she  occupies. 

There  are  three  Language  Arts  teachers  senior  to  Lawson,  Sheri  Jensen,  Mauro 
Staiano,  and  Heidi  Schlesiger,  who  share  the  same  seniority  date  and  thus  have  equal  rights 
to  bump  into  the  0.2  FTE  Language  Arts  position  Lawson  occupies.  The  district  applied  its 
tie-breaking  criteria,  and  determined  that  Jensen  is  the  most  senior  employee.  Jensen  is 
entitled  to  bump  into  the  0.2  FTE  Language  Art  position  retained  by  Lawson.  The  district 
has  so  notified  Jensen. 

7. 

Lori  Gladding  is  a  full-time  tenured  employee  of  the  district  with  a  seniority 
date  of  July  1,  1998.  Her  assignment  is  as  a  part-time  teacher  of  Family  Consumer  Studies 
at  the  high  school,  and  a  part-time  children’s  supervisor  in  the  Teen  Parent  Program.  In  her 
words,  her  assignments  are  fluid:  some  semesters  she  teaches  more  high  school  classes, 
some  semesters  she  spends  more  time  supervising  children.  This  semester,  she  is  teaching 
three  classes  at  the  high  school.  The  resolution  called  for  a  reduction of  0.8  FTE  of  Family 
Consumer  Studies  position,  and  0.275  FTE  Supervisor  of  Children  position. 

-4- 

 

Gladding  challenges  her  seniority  date.  She  says  that  she  worked  as  a  children’s 

supervisor  on a  full-time  basis  in  1997,  and  for  that  reason  she  should  retain  .8  FTE  position 
as  a  children’s  supervisor.  The  district’s  records  show  that  July  1,  1998,  was  the  day 
Gladding  signed  her  first  probationary  contract.  The  district  will  consider  any  other 
documentation  that  Gladding  can  provide  it  regarding  her  service  in  1997,  and  will  change 
her  seniority  date  if  that  is  established  by  her  documentation.  A  change  in  her  seniority 
date  does  not,  however,  alter  Gladding’s  status  in  this  proceeding.  Gladding  does  not  hold 
a  1.0  FTE  position  as  a  children’s  supervisor.  She  is  therefore  not  entitled  to  be  retained  as 
she  argues. 

8. 

Brooks  Franklin  is  a  full-time  math  teacher  at  Eureka  High  School.  He  has  a 
result  of  the  8.0  FTE  reduction  in  math  positions  or 
seniority  date  of  August  28,  2000.  Asa 
services,  his  1.0  FTE  position  is  being  eliminated.  Franklin  does  not  believe  that  the  district 
is  retaining  a  sufficient  number  of  math  teachers  in  order  to  cover  legally  mandated  math 
classes.  The  teacher’s  concerns  are,  at  this  time,  speculative.  The  district  believes  it  has 
retained  a  sufficient  number  of  teachers  in  order  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  district  based  on 
its  projected  enrollment.  The  enrollment  number,  however,  is  still  in  a  state  of  flux.  Many 
additional  decisions  will  need  to  be  made  by  the  board  and  the  district  before  an  accurate 
assessment  of  staffing  needs  can  be  made.  Because of the  financial  uncertainties  of  the 
district,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  service  is 
either  arbitrary  or  capricious.  (Campbell  Elementary  Teachers  Assn.  v.  Abbott  (1978) 
76  Cal.App.3d  796,  808.) 

9. 

Aaron  Staack  is  a  full-time  Fine  Arts  teacher  at  Eureka  High  School.  He  has 

a  seniority  date  of  November  2,  1998.  As a 
positions  or  services,  his  1.0  FTE  position  is  being  eliminated.  Staack  does  not  agree  with 
the  board’s  decision  to  reduce  the  Fine  Arts  program.  Because  of  the  financial  uncertainties 
of  the  district,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  service 
is  either  arbitrary  or  capricious.  (Campbell  Elementary  Teachers  Assn.  v.  Abbott,  supra, 
76  Cal.App.3d  at  p.  808.) 

result  of  the  5.0  FTE  reduction  in  Fine  Arts 

10. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  in  seniority  to  respondents  is  being  retained 
by  the  district  to  perform  services  that  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

11. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation of  particular  kinds of services  is  related  to  the 

welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof.
