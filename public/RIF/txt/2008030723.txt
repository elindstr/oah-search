The  Supplemental  Counselor  position  has  no  specific  full-time  equivalent  (FTE)  designation 
because  the  service  is  performed  by  a certificated  employee  on  an  hourly  basis,  as  needed. 

On  or  about  March  6,  2008,  the  District  provided  notice  to  Respondents  that 
their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of 
particular  kinds  of  services. 

Superintendent  McKee  thereafter  notified  the  Governing  Board  that  she  had 
recommended  that  notice  be  provided  to  15  certificated  employees,  including  Respondents,  that 
their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of 
particular  kinds  of  services. 

     

Respondents  thereafter  timely  requested  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause 

On  or  about  March  25,  2008,  the  District  issued  the  Accusation,  and  served  it  on 

for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

Respondents  filed  timely  notices  of  defense.

At  the  hearing,  the  District  dismissed  the  accusation  against  Respondents  Beyer,

The  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number  3  are  particular  kinds  of  services 

which  may  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955." 

12. 

The  Governing  Board  took  action  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  services  set  forth 
in  factual  finding  number  3  primarily  because  of  uncertainty  future  funding.  The  District 
estimates  a  revenue  shortfall  of  approximately  32  percent,  or  $1.1  million,  for  the  2008-2009 
school  year.  The  decision  to  reduce  the  particular  kinds  of  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor 
capricious  but  is  rather  a  proper  exercise  of  the  District's  discretion. 

13. 

The  reduction  of  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number 3 

is  related  to  the 
welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of 
certificated  employees  as  determined  by  the  Governing  Board. 

14. 

Respondent  Moon  first  rendered  paid  service  in 

a  probationary  position  on 
October  12,  1998.  She  is  senior  to  38  other  certificated  employees  and  junior  to  seven  others. 
She  holds  a  clear  multiple  subject  teaching  credential. 

15. 

In  March  2006,  Respondent  Moon  asked  Superintendent  McKee  for  permission 
to  work  part  time  during  the  2006-2008  school  year  to  spend  more  time  with  her  baby.  Both 
participants  to  the  discussions  agreed  at  the  hearing  that  Superintendent  McKee  explained  the 
options  available  to  Respondent:  a  leave  of  absence  or  a  reduction  of  .5  FTE,  but  disagreed  on 
key  points  of  the  conversation.  Superintendent  McKee  testified  that  she  made  it  clear  that  she 
believed  any  reduction  in  position  would  be  “permanent.”  Respondent  Moon  testified  that  any 
reduction  would  take  place  only  for  one  year,  and  that  she  could  not  afford  to  agree  to  a 
permanent  reduction.  Superintendent  McKee  prepared  the  following  written  understanding  of 
their  agreement,  which  Respondent  Moon  signed  on  March  17,  2006: 

The  purpose  of  this  memo  is  to  confirm  our  conversation  regarding  placement 
for  the  2006-2007  school  year.  I  am  requesting  a  voluntary  reduction  to  .5  FTE.  I 
understand  that  a  part  time  position  is  available  in  the  independent/home  school

I  understand  that  under  this  reassignment,  I  will  retain  my  status  as  a  Somis 
Union  School  District  employee  as  a  .5  employee  and  my  original  date  of  hire 
for  purposes  of  seniority. 

Thank  you  for  your  consideration  of  this  voluntary  reduction. 

Respondent  Moon  testified  that  she  believed  the  reduction  would  be  in  effect  for  only  one  year 
and  that  she  did  not  intend  to  permanently  reduce  her  assignment  by  .5  FTE. 

16. 

Respondent  Moon  also  worked  on  a part-time  basis  during  the  2001-2002  school 
year,  after  the  birth  of  a  prior  child.  Superintendent  McKee  was  not  a  District  employee  at  the 
time,  arriving  just  prior  to  the  2003-2004  school  year.  No  documentation  regarding  this  prior 
absence  was  provided  and  it  was  not  established  whether  it  was  leave  of  absence  or  a  temporary 
reduction.  In  any  event,  Respondent  Moon  returned  to  full-time  employment  for  the  2002-2003 
school  year. 

17. 

Respondent  Moon  received  her  assignment  for  the  2007-2008  school  year  during 
the  Summer  of  2007.  It  was  a  part-time  assignment  and  Respondent  Moon  complained  about 
the  continuing  reduction.  Superintendent  McKee  maintained  that  the  reduction  agreed  to  in 
March  2006  was  permanent.  Respondent  Moon  disagreed  and  asked  for  full-time  employment.

Another  employee,  Maya  Sheehey  (Sheehey),  was  on a  partial  leave  of  absence 
for  the  2007-2008  school  year,  and  Superintendent  McKee  was  able  to  assign  Respondent 
Moon  for  another  .5  FTE.  Superintendent  McKee  told  Respondent  Moon  that  she  would  have  a 
temporary  .5  FTE  for  the  school  year  and  that,  if  a  position  became  available,  then  Respondent 
Moon  could  be  given  consideration  for  reinstatement  to  full-time  status.

are  teaching  home  study

2. 

The  services  listed  in  factual  finding  number  3  are  determined  to  be  particular 
kinds  of  services  within  the  meaning  of  section  44955,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  3 
and  11. 

3. 

Cause  exists  under  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  District  to  reduce  or 
discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number  3,  which  cause 
relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District's  schools  and  pupils,  by  reason  of  factual  finding 
numbers  |  through  9  and  11  through  13. 

Cause  does  not  exist  to  reduce  the  services  of  Respondent  Moon  by  .5  FTE,  by 
reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  14  through  19.  While  the  District  may  indeed  reduce  a 
temporary  position  during  a  layoff  proceeding  such  as  this  one,  Respondent  Moon  was  not 
hired  to  fill  the  temporary  position  created  by  Sheehey’s  leave  of  absence.  She  is  a  permanent 
employee  and  her  position  was  not  rendered  a  permanent  part-time  one  by  virtue  of  the  March 
17,  2006  agreement.  The  March  17,  2006  document  does  not  contain  a  clear  indication  that 
Respondent  intended  to  permanently  reduce  her  position  to  a  .5  FTE.  The  District  drafted  the 
document  and  any  ambiguities  should  not  be  resolved  in  its  favor.  In  light  of  her  2001-2002 
part  time  employment  experience  and  her  financial  need  for  full-time  employment,  it  is  unlikely 
that  Respondent  would  have  agreed  to  a  permanent  reduction.  In  any  event,  the  most  reasonable 
construction  of  the  March  17,  2006  agreement,  is  that,  as  the  first  sentence  pronounces,  the 
reduction 
year.”  Accordingly, 
Respondent  Moon  is  presently  a  full-time  employee  of  the  District  with  sufficient  seniority  to 
displace,  or  bump,  any  one  of  several  junior  employees  retained  to  perform  services  which  she 
is  certificated  and  competent  to  render.
