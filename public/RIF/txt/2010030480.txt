The matter was submitted for decision on April 26, 2011.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

Trevor E. McDonald, Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, Alum

Rock Union Elementary School District, issued the accusation in his official capacity.

Respondents are certificated employees of the District.

1.

2.

3.

Whether the jurisdictional requirements with respect to respondent Kathy
Marie Williams were met will be considered separately. As to the other respondents, the
parties stipulated that the jurisdictional requirements of Education Code sections 44949 and
44955 have been met.

4.

On March 10, 2011, the board adopted Resolution No. 36-10/11 (“Reduction
of Particular Kinds of Service”), in which it determined that it was necessary to reduce K-8
Classroom Teacher services by an equivalent of 53.0 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) positions.
The resolution also set forth “skipping” criteria by which the District would retain

certificated employees, regardless of seniority, to provide special education, math, science,
physical education, and dual language immersion services.

5.

With the exception of respondent Kathy Marie Williams, the parties have
resolved the issues. Factual Findings 6 through 11 reflect their resolution of the issues.

6.

7.

A reduction of 56 FTE (53 FTE in the PKS resolution, plus 3 FTE discussed at

hearing) is at issue this matter.

District Exhibit 15 reflects the attrition of certificated employees representing

22 FTE. District will offset the 56 FTE in this matter with the 22 FTE attrition. Thus, 34
FTE are still at issue (56 FTE – 22 FTE = 34 FTE).

8.

The District has established its authority to reduce or eliminate 34 FTE, but

plans to layoff certificated employees representing only 21 FTE. The following respondents
are subject to layoff (numbers indicate position on seniority list):

seniority list.

Respondent Kathy Marie Williams appears as number 715 on the District’s

15.

On March 11, 2011, the District sent “March 15 notices” to numerous

certificated employees, including Williams, informing them that the District’s administration
had recommended to the governing board that they be given notice that their services would
not be required for the 2011 – 2012 school year. The notices (and associated materials) were
the same for each respondent. The District took the envelopes to the post office, deposited
them with certified mail postage paid in the amount of $5.71, and addressed to the last
known address of the employees. The notices sent to the other employees were properly
delivered by the United States Postal Service (USPS) (with the exception of a notice sent to
an address that had not been updated by the employee and one that was unclaimed by the
addressee). The Williams notice was sent to her correct address of record and bore certified
mail receipt 7009 2250 0002 8595 5795 and a “03/11/2011” postmark. The USPS, however,
later returned the notice to the District for $.44 postage due.

16.

On March 14, 2011, the District sent a second layoff notice to Williams. The

envelope bore certified mail receipt 7009 2250 0002 8595 5023 and a “03/14/2011”
postmark, and was later returned by the USPS for $0.44 postage due. District personnel sent
the second notice to Williams after they checked the USPS website and found “no record” of
the notice mailed on March 11 (certified mail receipt 7009 2250 0002 8595 5795).

17.

At some point, Williams called the District office to say she had not received

the layoff notice. On or about March 25, 2011, Williams went to the office and picked up
and signed for the notice mailed on March 14, 2011. Williams had actual notice and the
ability to participate in the proceedings.

18.

It is unclear why the USPS twice returned the notices mailed to Williams for
postage due when the notices sent to other certificated employees were properly delivered.
Information submitted by respondents from the USPS website suggests that the size, weight
or thickness of the envelopes containing the March 15 notices may have been such that a
postal employee could have concluded that an additional amount of postage was required.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Education Code section 44949 provides for the “March 15 notice.”

Subdivision (a) states, in pertinent part:

No later than March 15 and before an employee is given notice
by the governing board that his or her services will not be
required for the ensuing year for the reasons specified in Section
44955, the governing board and the employee shall be given
written notice by the superintendent of the district or his or her

-4-

designee, or in the case of a district which has no superintendent
by the clerk or secretary of the governing board, that it has been
recommended that the notice be given to the employee, and
stating the reasons therefor.

Subdivision (d) provides:

Any notice or request shall be deemed sufficient when it is
delivered in person to the employee to whom it is directed, or
when it is deposited in the United States registered mail, postage
prepaid and addressed to the last known address of the
employee.

The parties agree that under pertinent statutes, certified mail may be used where

registered mail is specified. On March 11, 2011, the District sent March 15 notices to
numerous certificated employees, including Kathy Marie Williams. The envelopes, their
contents, and the amount of certified mail postage paid for each notice was the same. It is
unclear why the USPS twice returned the notices sent to Williams, while properly delivering
the others. It is possible that a zealous postal employee concluded that additional postage
was required for the notices addressed to Williams. Whatever may have happened to the
Williams notices, the District sent the same notice to her as it did to many other certificated
employees. That the vast majority of notices, with the same content and same postage, were
delivered by the USPS supports the contention that the District paid the correct amount of
postage. The parties, moreover, have already stipulated that the jurisdictional requirements
for the other respondents in this matter have been met. Having handled the notices for these
employees, including Williams, in the same way, it cannot be concluded that the District met
the jurisdictional requirements for all employees except Williams. The District complied
with section 44949. Additionally, there is not a lack of actual notice or prejudice to
Williams; she called the District to say she had not received the March 15 notice, and she had
the same opportunity to participate in these proceedings as the other respondents. Williams
is subject to layoff on the same terms as the other remaining respondents.

2.

The parties resolved all other issues by agreement, as is set forth in Factual

Findings 6 through 11. They agree that the following respondents are subject to layoff
(Factual Finding 8):

735 Abigale Amarido
692 Erin Amchan
730 Lori Gioco
732 Jennifer Greenbaum
703 Stacey Harrison
717 Meaghan Quinn
712 Jonathan Natividad
715 Melissa Pasa

3.

Because of the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services, cause
exists pursuant to Education Code section 44955 to give notice to the respondents listed in
Legal Conclusion 2, and to respondent Kathy Marie Williams, that their services will not be
required for the 2011 – 2012 school year. This cause solely relates to the welfare of the
schools and the pupils thereof within the meaning of Education Code section 44949.

ORDER

Notice may be given to the respondents referenced in Legal Conclusion 3 that their

services will not be required for the 2011 – 2012 school year. No permanent or probationary
certificated employee with less seniority than a respondent may be retained to provide a
service for which a respondent is credentialed and competent to render.
