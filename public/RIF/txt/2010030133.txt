FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1. 

 
 
Kip Meyer, Assistant Superintendent, Lake Elsinore Unified School District, 
made and filed the accusation dated March 10, 2010, in his official capacity as the designee 
of Dr. Frank Passarella, District Superintendent. 
 
 

Respondents1 are certificated district employees. 

2. 

Respondents are the individuals identified in Appendix A.  The district initially identified other individuals 

                                                 
1  
for layoff or for precautionary layoff, but who are not included in Appendix A because they do not appear on the 
district’s final proposed layoff list.  Eleven individuals did not request a hearing and thus are not respondents in this 
matter.  The majority of these individuals (Jill Daniels, Sharon King Seelman, Janet Niles, Rachael Panza, Lori 
Robertson, Henry Shimojyo, Yamileth Shimojyo, and Chelsey Traylor) are on the district’s final layoff list.  
However, since they are not formally respondents, their names do not appear in Appendix A.

3. 

On February 11, 2010, in accordance with Education Code sections 44949 and 
44955, the superintendent notified the Board of Trustees of the Lake Elsinore Unified School 
District in writing of his recommendation to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of 
services for the upcoming school year.  The superintendent stated the reasons for the 
recommendation.  The recommendation that respondents be terminated from employment 
was not related to their competency as teachers. 
 

4. 

On February 11, 2010, the board adopted Resolution No. 2009-10-052, 

determining that it would be necessary to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services at 
the end of the current school year.  The board determined that the particular kinds of services 
that must be reduced for the 2010-2011 school year were the following full time equivalent 
(FTE) positions:

The proposed reductions totaled 195 FTE positions.  

5. 

The board further determined in Resolution No. 09-10-052 that “competency,” 
as described in Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), for the purposes of bumping, 
“shall necessarily include possession of:  (1) A valid credential in the relevant subject matter 
area; (2) ‘highly qualified’ status under the No Child Left Behind Act in the position to be 
assumed; (3) an appropriate formal (not emergency) EL authorization, if required by the 
position to be assumed; and (4) for positions in earth and physical sciences, a specific 
credential for each and physical sciences.” 
 

6. 

The board further determined in Resolution No. 2009-10-052 that it would be 
necessary to retain certificated employees who possess special training and competency that 
other certificated employees with more seniority might not possess, to wit employees who 
have authorization to teach English Learner (EL) students, employees who are “highly 
qualified” in their subject matter areas and who possess the training and experience that 
comes therewith, and employees who possess specific credentials to teach earth and physical 
sciences and the training and experience that comes therewith.   

2

7. 

The board directed the superintendent or his designee to determine which 

employees’ services would not be required for the 2010-2011 school year as a result of the 
reduction of the foregoing particular kinds of services.  The board further directed the 
superintendent or his designee to send appropriate notices to all certificated employees of the 
district who would be laid off as a result of the reduction of these particular kinds of services. 
 

8. 

On or before March 15, 2010, the district timely served on respondents a 
written notice that the superintendent had recommended that their services would not be 
required for the upcoming school year, along with the related accusation.  The notice set 
forth the reasons for the recommendation.  The notice advised respondents of their right to a 
hearing, that each respondent had to deliver a request for a hearing in writing to the person 
sending the notice by the date specified in the notice, a date which in each case was more 
than seven days after the notice was served, and that the failure to request a hearing would 
constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. 
 

The recommendation that respondents be terminated from employment was not 

related to their competency as teachers.  
 
 
All pre-hearing jurisdictional requirements were met. 
 

9. 

Respondents timely filed written requests for hearing and notices of defense.

Respondents are probationary or permanent certificated employees of the

“particular kinds of services” that could be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of 
Education Code section 44955.  The board’s decision to reduce or discontinue these 
particular kinds of services was not arbitrary or capricious and constituted a proper exercise 
of the board’s discretion. 
 
 
The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related to the 
welfare of the district and its pupils.  The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of 
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the district as 
determined by the board. 
 
The board considered all positively assured attrition, including resignations, 
 
retirements and requests for transfer, in determining the actual number of necessary layoff 
notices to be delivered to its employees. 
 
 
services which any respondent was certificated and competent to render. 
 
 
2007.  During the 2007-2008 school year, Fry worked a two-thirds rather than a full-time 
assignment.  Fry worked in a full-time assignment the following school year.  Fry claimed 
that she should have permanent status, whereas the district seniority list reflected her status 

Jasmine Fry teaches elementary school and has a seniority date of August 16,

16. 

In January 2010, the district sent each of its certificated employees a verification 

as second year probationary.  The district apparently reached this conclusion based on the 
fact that Fry only worked a two-thirds assignment during the 2007-2008 school year.  
However, at the hearing, the district conceded that if its records are consistent with Fry’s 
testimony that she worked 75% of the school days during the 2007-2008 school year, then 
her status should and will be changed to permanent, regardless of the fact that she worked in 
a part-time assignment during that year.2
 
Cynthia Seymour teaches elementary school.  She was first employed by the 
 
district in 1991.  She worked for five years and then took a leave of absence when her first 
child was born.  She had a second child and extended her leave.  In 1995, she was told that 
her leave could not be extended:  She either had to return to work or resign her employment.  
Seymour decided to resign.  She was reemployed by the district on August 19, 2004.  She 
believed she should be given credit for her initial four to five years of district service. 
 
 
form, which provided information concerning the employee’s seniority date, credentialing, 
and other matters relevant to a potential layoff proceeding.  Seymour received such a form, 
and she returned it to the district after checking the box stating that the district’s information 
(including the August 19, 2004 seniority date) was accurate.  Seymour never thereafter 
advised the district that her seniority date was incorrect. 
 
 
reemployment.  Accordingly, the district corrected determined her seniority date was  
August 19, 2004. 
 
17.  Kebra Deckert is a middle school counselor.  The district has assigned her a 
 
seniority date of August 9, 2007.  Deckert attended an AVID conference in about the third 
week of July 2007, and she therefore believed that her seniority date should be modified to 
reflect her attendance at that conference.  If her position on this issue is rejected, then she 
believed that her seniority date should be August 1, 2007, the date she first met with her 
principal.  Deckert testified that her principal “asked” her to attend the AVID conference.  
She testified that she did not believe that her attendance at the AVID conference was part of 
her contractual 195-day school year.  She believed, but was not certain, that August 1, 2007, 
was part of her 195-day contract year. 
 
When Deckert returned the January 2010 verification form, she checked the box 
 
stating that the district’s information (including the August 9, 2007 seniority date) was 
accurate.  Deckert never thereafter advised the district that her seniority date was incorrect.   
 
 
AVID conference as a part of her 195-day employment contract or that she was paid to do so 
under that contract.  Her testimony concerning the nature of her meeting with the principal

The parties are in agreement that this change to permanent status would not affect Fry’s layoff, but it would 

                                                 
2  
affect her placement on a recall list.

18.  Golden Crews is a high school counselor.  Shortly after he signed his district 

was vague, and she did not establish that that meeting was required by her contract, that it 
occurred during her contract year, or that she was paid to attend.  As of January 2010, and for 
a substantial period of time thereafter, Deckert apparently believed the district had correctly 
assigned her correct seniority date.  Based on the evidence presented, Deckert’s attendance at 
the training conference and the meeting with the principal did not constitute her first day of 
paid date or probationary service with the district within the meaning of section 44845.  The 
district correctly determined that Deckert’s seniority date was August 9, 2007.3
 
 
employment contract in July 2009, Crews was told that his position was funded under 
Assembly Bill 18024 and that the position was protected as long as funding existed.  Crews 
did not claim that he was told that his employment was itself protected. 
 
 
In Resolution No. 09-10-052, the board did not segregate AB 1802 counselors from 
non-AB 1802 counselors.  In fact, the duties of district counselors do not differ based upon 
the source of their funding.  Regardless of which counselors are laid off, the funded AB 1802 
positions will be preserved.  For example, if a counselor who currently holds an AB 1802 
position is laid off, that position can be filled next year by a counselor who currently holds a 
regular counseling position. 
 
 
this layoff was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and it constituted a proper exercise of the 
board’s discretion.  The layoff of Crews was proper. 
 
 
preliminary multiple subject credential and is NCLB highly qualified to teach in a self-
contained K-8 core assignment.  She believed she should be able to bump several less senior 
teachers who were also currently in elementary school assignments, but who, though subject 
to layoff in terms of their seniority as elementary teachers, were able to bump into secondary 
school teaching positions by virtue of their credentials and authorizations.  Specifically:  
Tom Haldeman was able to bump into a middle school math position by virtue of his 
supplementary authorization in math; Holly Spillman was able to bump into a middle school 
language arts position by virtue of her supplementary authorization in English; Sabrina 
McFarlaine was able to bump into a high school special education position by virtue of her 
special education credential; and Bonnie Henry was able to bump into a middle school math 
position by virtue of her supplementary authorization in math.  Mauldin-Pelaez does not hold 
a supplementary authorization and she did not identify a secondary school teaching position 
which she was competent and credentialed to occupy over a more junior employee. 

The decision not to segregate AB 1802 and non-AB 1802 counselors for purposes of 

19.  Helen Mauldin-Pelaez is an elementary school teacher.  She holds a 

Even if Deckert were given the requested July 2007 seniority date, she would apparently still be laid off, 

                                                 
3  
since counselors hired well before July 2007 are also designated for layoff.  Similarly, though Deckert has a multiple 
subject credential, elementary teachers with far more seniority than she are designated for layoff, so it would not 
appear that Deckert could bump into an elementary teaching position.

counseling positions. As of the date of the hearing, state funding under AB 1802 was continuing.   
 

Assembly Bill 1802, enacted several years ago, provided special state funding for certain public school 

 

5

Accordingly, the district correctly designated Mauldin-Pelaez for layoff.  

20.  Dana Minock teaches high school Intensive English.  The district’s records 

 
 
 
reflect that Minock has preliminary single subject credentials in English and health science.  
Minock believed the district should deem her English credential as clear for purposes of this 
layoff proceeding and that, if it did so, she would move up 20 to 30 places on the seniority 
list so that she might possibly avoid layoff either directly or through an opportunity to bump 
a more junior employee in another assignment.  Minock testified that she could not secure a 
clear English credential until she had completed all EL requirements, that she completed 
those requirements (specifically, her CLAD coursework) in April 2009, that she did not 
realize until recently that her credential was still not clear, and that the paperwork by which 
she was to gain her clear credential was not signed until March 24, 2010.  She added that the 
district had all of her paperwork in April 2009.   
 
Minock returned the January 2010 verification form.  She disputed certain 
 
information contained in the form, but she did not dispute the preliminary nature of her 
credentials.  She was unable to explain this omission during her testimony, though she did 
state that the form she received from the district prompted her to look into why her credential 
had not yet cleared. 
 
 
Minock’s testimony was unclear with regard to what occurred or did not occur 
between April 2009 and March 2010, or what the precise reason was for the delay in having 
her credential cleared.  The evidence did not establish that the cause was any failure on the 
part of the district. 
 
 
credential as of March 15, 2010, the deadline for the issuance of layoff notices in this matter.  
The district is not required to consider subsequent events.  The district properly designated 
Minock for layoff. 
 

The evidence established that Minock did not have a clear English or health science 

21. 

Lori Edwards was first employed by the district on August 11, 2003.  In 

August 2006, Edwards requested a leave of absence from her employment in order to care 
for her daughter, who was suffering from serious medical problems, and her daughter’s 
infant child.  Edwards testified that the district refused to grant her a leave of absence, thus 
requiring her to resign her district employment, effective August 17, 2006.  Edwards was 
rehired by the district on August 16, 2007,5 which the district therefore claimed was her 
                                                 
5  
The circumstances of Edwards’ rehire and are in dispute.  The district claims that Edwards was rehired as a 
long-term substitute, that she served as a long-term substitute in the position vacated by another teacher who was on 
an extended leave during the 2007-2008 school year, and that Edwards was hired in a permanent position for the 
2008-2009 school year.  Since Edwards worked more than 75% of the 2007-2008 school year in a substitute 
position, the district tacked on that year of service for seniority purposes, and assigning her a seniority date of 
August 16, 2007.  Edwards contends to the contrary that she was hired for the 2007-2008 year as a permanent 
employee.  A resolution of this dispute is unnecessary here, however, since:  (i) As noted, the district assigned 
Edwards a seniority date coinciding with the commencement of the 2007-2008 school year; and (ii) it is of course 
undisputed that Edwards is currently a permanent employee, and thus has all the rights that status confers, including 
those relating to this layoff proceeding.

seniority date pursuant to Education Code section 44848.  Edwards, on the other hand, 
claimed that her break in service should not operate to cut off her original seniority date, 
despite section 44848, because the district’s refusal to provide her with a leave of absence 
violated the Family Medical Leave Act. 
 

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides certain employees with up to 
12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year.  It also requires that group health benefits 
be maintained during the leave.  The FMLA applies, inter alia, to all employees of public 
elementary and secondary schools.  No published California decision has addressed whether 
the FMLA has any applicability to teacher layoff cases under Education Code section 44955.  
The FMLA does not on its face, however, appear to affect the operation of the layoff statute, 
and the concerns underlying the FMLA appear to be distinct from those underlying the layoff 
statute.  No authority was presented to support the position that the FMLA was intended to 
overrule the detailed, carefully-balanced, interrelated provisions of the layoff statute, in 
particular section 44848.  Further, the FMLA is enforced by the U.S. Labor Department's 
Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division.  If violations cannot be 
satisfactorily resolved, the Department may bring action in court to compel compliance.  An 
eligible employee may also bring a private civil action against an employer for violations.  
No authority was presented to suggest that an administrative law judge has jurisdiction to 
enforce alleged violations of the FMLA in the context of a teacher layoff proceeding, and it 
is concluded that an administrative law judge lacks such jurisdiction. 
 
 
district as a result of union activity on her part.6  However, no evidence was presented to 
suggest possible anti-union animus against her.  Further, while she claimed that the district 
was using the layoff proceeding also to terminate other union representatives for their 
engagement in protected activities, no other such employee so testified at the hearing. 
 

Edwards also asserted that her proposed layoff was the result of discrimination by the 

Finally, Edwards, who is African American, raised several issues pertaining to alleged 

racial discrimination by the district in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
and other federal legislation.  First, she asserted that the district’s administration of the 
current layoff has a disproportionate impact on racial minority groups.  In support of her 
position, Edwards asserted, inter alia, that she is the only African American teacher at her 
school site, that less than two percent of district teachers are African American, that many 
district school sites have no African American teachers, and that if the layoff proceeds as the 
district proposes, there will not be enough African American teachers to place even one at 
each school site.  Second, Edwards asserted that the percentage of African American and 
other minority teachers in the district was substantially lower than the percentages of those 
groups in the general population served by the district.  Edwards claimed that the relevant 
statistics constituted clear evidence of underrepresentation of protected groups in the district.  
Third, Edwards asserted that the district willfully and maliciously engaged in discriminatory 
practices against her on the basis of her race.  In support of her position, she asserted

member. 

Edwards has held several union positions, such as site representative and association grievance team 

 

7

numerous allegations of illegal, discriminatory conduct on the part of the district since the 
2006-2007 school year. 
 

Enforcement of Title VII and other federal employment discrimination legislation is 

entrusted to such agencies as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and/or is 
conferred on private parties through civil suits.  No authority was presented to suggest that an 
administrative law judge has jurisdiction to enforce alleged violations of civil rights statutes 
in the context of a teacher layoff proceeding, and it is concluded that an administrative law 
judge lacks such jurisdiction. 
 

Further, no evidence was presented to suggest the district’s implementation of the 

layoff was motivated to any extent by an actual intent to discriminate against Edwards or any 
other individual on the basis of race or any other improper classification.  Instead, the 
evidence established that the district did nothing more and nothing less than attempt to 
administer its PKS layoff pursuant to the requirements of section 44955 without regard to 
racial or ethnic considerations.  No legal authority was offered that any alleged disparate 
impact on minority groups of a non-discriminatorily motivated PKS layoff renders the layoff 
unlawful.7
 
 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

2. 

1. 

A district may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955, 

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 

 
 
44955.  All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied. 
 
 
subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not, 
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that 
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to 
deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 
178-179.) 
 

3. 

A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a 

continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to fill.  In doing so, the 
senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that position.  
(Lacy v. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469.)  Junior teachers may be 
given retention priority over senior teachers if the junior teachers possess superior skills or 
capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack.  (Santa Clara Federation of Teachers, 
Local 2393, v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified School District (1981) 116 
Cal.App.3d 831, 842-843.)

probationary position.”

Contrary to Edwards’ assertion, Education Code section 44100 does not constitute such authority.

Pursuant to Education Code section 44918, subdivision (a), “an employee

classified as a substitute or temporary employee, who serves during one school year for at 
least 75 percent of the number of days the regular schools of the district were maintained in 
that school year and has performed the duties normally required of a certificated employee of 
the school district, shall be deemed to have served a complete school year as a probationary 
employee if employed as a probationary employee for the following school year.” 
 
 
If a certificated employee resigns and is thereafter reemployed, her date of 
employment is normally—and with exceptions inapplicable here—deemed by Education 
Code section 44848 to be the date of reemployment.  (San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen 
(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 641.)8
 
 
that when a permanent certificated employee resigns, and then is reemployed within 39 
months, the district shall “disregarding the break in service, classify him or her as, and 
restore to him or her all of the rights, benefits and burdens of, a permanent employee, except 
as otherwise provided in this code.”  (Emphasis added).  While section 44931 refers in 
general terms to “rights, benefits, and burdens,” section 44848 more specifically addresses 
the date of reemployment.  As such, reemployment rights are “otherwise provided in this 
code” and constitutes an exception to section 44931. 
 
 
“to have been employed on the date upon which he first rendered paid service in a

accusation.  Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the district to 
reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services.  The cause for the reduction or 
discontinuation of particular kinds of services related solely to the welfare of the schools and 
the pupils thereof.  Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees of the district 
due to the reduction and discontinuation of particular kinds of services.  The district 
identified the certificated employees providing the particular kinds of services that the Board 
directed be reduced or discontinued.  It is recommended that the board give respondents 
notice before May 15, 2010, that their services are no longer required by the district. 
 
 

Pursuant to Education Code section 44845, certificated employees are deemed 

A preponderance of the evidence sustained the charges set forth in the

Section 44848 provides:  

“When any certificated employee shall have resigned or been dismissed for cause and shall thereafter have 
been reemployed by the board, his date of employment shall be deemed to be the date on which he first 
accepted reemployment (if reemployed before July 1, 1947) or rendered paid service (if reemployed after 
June 30, 1947) after his reemployment.  When an employee's services are terminated for lack of enrollment 
or discontinuance of service or are otherwise interrupted in a manner declared by law not to constitute a 
break in service, his original order of employment shall stand.”

ADVISORY DETERMINATION 

The following advisory determination is made: 

The accusations served on respondents are sustained.  Notice may be given to such 

 
 
respondents before May 15, 2010, that their services will not be required because of the 
reduction or discontinuation of particular services as indicated.
