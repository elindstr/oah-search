LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949  

and 44955.  As set forth in Factual Findings 1 and 2 and the Stipulation, all notices 
and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied.  
 

2. 

The Governing Board may reduce, discontinue or eliminate a particular  

kind of service and then provide the needed services to the students in another 
manner. (Gallup v. Board of Trustees (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1571; California 

 

 

3

Teachers Association v. Board of Trustees of Goleta Union School Dist. (1982) 132 
Cal.App.3d 32.)  A school board may reduce services within the meaning of the 
statute either by determining that a certain type of service shall not be performed at all 
or by reducing the number of district employees who perform such services.  
(Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64 
Cal.App.3d 167.) 
 

As set forth in Factual Findings 1 and 5, the services identified in the 

Resolutions are particular kinds of services that may be reduced or discontinued under 
Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.  The Board’s decision to reduce or 
discontinue the identified services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and was a 
proper exercise of its discretion.  Cause for the reduction or discontinuance of 
services relates solely to the welfare of the District’s schools and pupils within the 
meaning of Education Code section 44949 and 44955. 
 

3. 

As set forth in the Stipulation and in the Factual Findings and Legal 

Conclusions as a whole, the District has established that no employees junior to 
respondents are being retained to perform the services which respondents are 
certificated and competent to render.
