following particular kinds of services for the 2010-2011 school year: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The district has determined that it must reduce services because it expects 
budget reductions of approximately $18 million for the 2010-2011 school year.  Before 
identifying the services to reduce or eliminate, the district consulted with fiscal advisors from 
the County of Office of Education and with Schools Services of California for advice on the 
types of services to reduce or eliminate and the extent of the reductions.  The district also 
took into account which services it could reduce or eliminate without renegotiating existing 
labor contracts.

Skipping issues 
 
 
permanent employees must be laid off in the inverse order of their seniority.  Subdivision 
(d)(1) of that section provides, however, that a school district may deviate from terminating 
an employee in order of seniority and “skip” that employee if

that course or course of study or to provide those services, 
which others with more seniority do not possess. 

11. 

Board Resolution No. 0910-34 calls for reductions of 2.00 FTE in high school 
music, 4.20 FTE in elementary music, and 10.90 FTE in elementary music preparation.  The 
resolution authorizes the district to skip the following employees when it implements the 
reductions: 
 

Employees who possess a Music Credential who have been 
teaching a music course at the high school level in the District in 
2009-2010, and who will be assigned to teach in such a course 
in the District in 2010-2011. 

Based on this skipping provision, the district did not issue preliminary layoff notices 

 
The same credential is required to teach elementary and middle school music as high school 
music: a single subject music credential.  Since assignments for the 2010-2011 school year 
are in the control of the district, the heart of this skipping provision is whether the employee 
was assigned to teach a high school music course during the 2009-2010 school year. 
 
 
to those music teachers who are currently teaching a high school music course.  The evidence 
does not establish how many teachers were skipped or what their current assignments are.  It 
is clear, however, that Bruce Haines (seniority date September 2, 1994), John Orosco 
(September 3, 1999), Kevin Cato (September 1, 2000), and Bryan Holbrook (August 30, 
2004) are among the teachers who were skipped.  They are all permanent employees.  It is 
possible that Earl Cato, Kevin Cato’s brother, was also skipped; he is a probationary 
employee.  The district acknowledged at hearing that the teachers were skipped without 
regard to the number of high school music sections they teach; some of the skipped teachers 
teach only one or two music sections per day in the high school and spend the remainder of 
the day in middle school or elementary school.  Orosco, for example, is assigned to “prep 
music” at Burbank Elementary School but was deemed eligible for a skip because he teaches 
one section of music in high school; Haines teaches one choir class in high school and the 
rest of his day is spent at an elementary school. 
 

12.  Assistant Superintendent Becnel is uncertain about the origins or the basis of 
the skip for current high school music teachers.  She testified that “it was an issue last year” 
when teachers were recalled and “some elementary school teachers did not want to go to the 
high schools and felt they could not do it.”  Becnel believes that the purpose of the skip is to 
provide “consistency of program” at the high school.  She notes that the high school music 
program includes choral music, orchestra, band and jazz band, and marching band, and that 
the high school teachers must organize several concerts during the school year.  The district 
has never undertaken a study to determine whether the teachers who taught a high school 
music class during the 2009-2010 school year have special training and experience that their 
more senior colleagues do not possess.  Before issuing preliminary layoff notices in March 

 

 

5

 
13. 

 
14. 

2010, the district did not contact its middle and elementary school music teachers to see if 
any of them would be willing to teach a high school music course. 

Respondents Diane Tiller, Beverly Johnson and Victoria Schmidt challenge 

the validity of the skip for current high school music teachers.  They are permanent 
employees assigned to teach music in the district’s middle and/or elementary schools.  Each 
of them possesses a single subject music credential.  Each of them has been identified for 
layoff.  Tiller’s seniority date is September 13, 1995; Johnson’s is August 26, 1998; and 
Schmidt’s is September 1, 1987.  Tiller, Johnson and Schmidt would each be willing to 
accept a high school music assignment. 

The burden of proof is on the district to demonstrate that it has “a specific 
need for personnel to teach a specific course or course of study,” and that the teachers it 
skipped have “special training and experience necessary to teach that course or course of 
study . . . which others with more seniority do not possess.”  (Ed. Code, § 44955, subd. 
(d)(1).)   

 
The district did not meet its burden.  The credential required to teach music at the 
elementary, middle and high school levels is the same.  The district did not identify what 
special training and experience, if any, is necessary to teach a high school music course.  The 
district did not establish that the junior employees it skipped possess that special training and 
experience and that their more senior colleagues do not possess it.   

 
Although the burden of proof is on the district to establish the validity of its skipping 
provision, not on respondents to demonstrate their competence to teach high school courses, 
the professional experience of respondents Tiller, Johnson and Schmidt further illustrates the 
weakness of the board’s skipping provision.  Tiller currently teaches seventh grade strings 
and band and eighth grade orchestra at Chavez Middle School.  She has taught music at 
Tennyson High School in the past, and she knows most of the Tennyson music students 
because they came through her middle school program.  She has private students who are in 
high school.  Johnson teaches instrumental music at Bret Harte Middle School and at each of 
the district’s four, year-round elementary schools.  She teaches marching band and jazz band 
after school.  Johnson has experience teaching at the high school level, and she teaches 
concert band and applied flute at Chabot College.  For the past 26 years, she has taught 
summer music to students in grades seven through 12.  Schmidt spends 60 percent of her day 
teaching “music prep” in elementary schools and, for the remaining 40 percent of her day, 
she is the choral director at Ochoa Middle School. 

 
The district failed to demonstrate a sufficient basis to deviate from seniority when 
implementing the reductions in music.  The district’s skipping provision does not comply 
with the requirements of Education Code section 44955, subdivision (d), and is not valid. 

 
15. 

Because the number and identities of the teachers who were skipped is not 

known, it is not possible to determine which senior employees, and how many senior 
employees, were prejudiced by the skips.  It appears, however, that at least some of the 

 

6

teachers who were skipped should have received layoff notices.  (It may be that Haines, with 
a seniority date of September 2, 1994, was not exposed to layoff, but the evidence on that 
point is not clear.)  The appropriate remedy, which will be ordered, is to direct the district to 
identify the teachers who were improperly skipped and then to rescind the layoff notices of a 
corresponding number of the most senior teachers who were prejudiced by the skips.  (See 
Alexander v. Board of Trustees (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 567, 576.) 

 
The district argues that if its skipping provision is found invalid, the only teachers 

who should be affected are those who were laid off from middle school music assignments.  
There is no evidence, the district asserts, that the skill and experience necessary to teach 
music at the elementary level is the same as that at the high school level. 

 
The district’s argument improperly shifts the burden of proof onto the respondents.  It 

is the district’s burden to demonstrate the validity of its skipping provision, a burden that it 
failed to carry.  Because the district improperly deviated from seniority when it implemented 
the reductions in music, it must now rescind the layoff notices issued to the most senior 
employees who were prejudiced by the district’s action.  Who those employees will be 
depends on the identity and number of the teachers who were retained, the particular service 
they were performing that made them susceptible to layoff under the board’s resolution, and 
respondents’ seniority. 

In Resolution No. 0910-34, the board also authorized the district to skip the 

 
16. 

following employees: 
 

Employees who possess a Bilingual Crosscultural Language 
Academic Development (CLAD) certificate or equivalent, 
whose experience includes teaching in a bilingual course in the 
District in 2009-2010 that requires possession of a BCLAD, and 
who will be assigned to teach in such a course in the District in 
2010-2011. 

Respondent Guadalupe Santoyo is a bilingual counselor.  She contends that she 

should be skipped under this provision.  Santoyo, however, is a counselor, not a classroom 
teacher.  Santoyo is not entitled to be skipped. 

In Resolution No. 0910-34, the board also authorized the district to skip the 

 
17. 

following employees: 
 

Employees who possess the necessary credentials to teach 
Special Education courses, whose experience includes teaching 
Special Education course [sic] in the District in 2009-2010, and 
who will be assigned to teach in such a course in the District in 
2010-2011.

Respondent Cecilia Vitug is a nurse who spends 80 percent of her time on special 

education issues.  She contends that she should be skipped under this provision.  Vitug, 
however, is not a classroom teacher.  She is not entitled to be skipped. 

19. 

18. 

Respondent Alice Gibson is a permanent teacher in the adult school.  She has 

 
Seniority issues 
 
 
been assigned a seniority date of September 20, 1999, for a 0.40 FTE position, and a 
seniority date of November 26, 2001, for a 1.00 FTE position.  She contends that she is 
entitled to a seniority date of “November 1999” for a 0.60 position.  Gibson, however, does 
not claim that any junior employee is being retained for services that she is certificated and 
competent to render; it appears that all of the adult school teachers junior (and senior) to 
Gibson have been noticed for layoff.  It is not necessary in this proceeding to address the 
issue of Gibson’s seniority date for a 0.60 FTE position. 
 
 
2006. 
 
Bumping issues 
 
 
in the adult school with seniority dates of August 30, 2004, and September 3, 2002, 
respectively.  Neither Kanakis nor Roganova has ever taught in the district’s regular 
education program, but both of them hold credentials that would allow them to do so.  
(Kanakis holds a multiple subject credential and a single subject credential in social science, 
and Roganova holds single subject credentials in English and French.)  They contend that 
they should be given the right to bump less senior employees in the district’s regular 
education program. 
 

Respondents Elaine Kanakis and Tatiana Roganova are permanent employees 

The parties stipulated that respondent Amy Kohl’s seniority date is August 21, 

20. 

Although Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), does not distinguish 

between adult school and regular school teachers, section 44929.26 of that code does.  It 
states, in relevant part, that “service in the evening school [adult school] shall not be included 
in computing the service required as a prerequisite to attainment of, or eligibility to, 
classification as a permanent employee in the day school [regular education program].”  By 
the same token, service in the regular school program does not count toward becoming a 
permanent employee in the adult school.  Section 44929.26 goes on to state that if a 
permanent teacher in adult school later becomes eligible for classification as a permanent 
teacher in the regular education program “by reason of having served the probationary period 
therein,” the teacher must choose which classification to take.  Since service in the adult 
school program does not count toward achieving permanent status in the regular education 
program (and vice versa), a teacher in the adult school should not be able to assert seniority 
rights over a teacher in the regular education program.  Respondents Kanakis and Roganova 
are not entitled to bump less senior teachers in the regular education program.

21. 

Respondents argue that the district’s decision to reduce counseling services is 

Challenges to the validity of the district’s decisions 
 
 
“arbitrary and capricious” and therefore invalid.  Their argument is based on the fact that, 
after the reductions, the district will be left with one counselor for each of its high schools 
and one half-time counselor for each middle school.  The district will also lose two valuable 
programs that encourage high school students to go on to college, AVID and Puente, because 
these programs must be administered by trained counselors and those counselors are being 
laid off. 
 
Provided that it does not reduce services below any legally mandated level, it is 
within the governing board’s discretion to determine the extent to which any service will be 
reduced.  (San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 635-636.)  The 
validity of the board’s decision “‘is measured by the standard set by reason and reasonable 
people, bearing in mind that such a standard may permit a difference of opinion on the same 
subject.’”  (Campbell Elementary Teachers Assn. v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 808.) 

 
The evidence does not support a conclusion that the board acted unreasonably in 

reducing counseling services.  There is no claim that counseling services have been reduced 
below any legally mandated level.  The district readily acknowledges that the reduction is 
undesirable.  Assistant Superintendent Becnel testified that the district does not want to lose 
the counselors or their programs, and continues to look for funds that will allow the district 
to rehire the counselors.  Faced with an $18 million budget shortfall, however, the board 
could reasonably conclude that service reductions in other areas would be even less 
desirable.  The evidence does not establish that the board acted arbitrarily or capriciously in 
reducing counseling services, and its decision to do so is not invalid. 

 
22. 

Respondents make the same argument concerning the district’s decision to 
reduce nursing services.  At the present time, the district has approximately 10 FTE nurse 
positions.  Under the board’s resolution, the district would be left with about 1.75 or 2.00 
FTE positions.  The nurse-respondents point out that they perform valuable services, such as 
hearing and vision screening, and that some of the services they perform, such as 
administering injections to diabetic students, can be performed only by a licensed health care 
professional.   
 
The evidence does not establish that the board acted unreasonably in reducing nursing 
services.  Respondents do not claim that nursing services have been reduced below a legally 
mandated level.  Assistant Superintendent Becnel testified that the district will contract for 
some nursing services and is in discussions with public health officials about the provision of 
other services.  It is within the governing board’s discretion to reduce a particular kind of 
service and have that service performed in a different manner.  (Campbell Elementary 
Teachers Assn. v. Abbott, supra, 76 Cal.App.3d at p. 812.)  The evidence does not establish 
that the board acted arbitrarily or capriciously in reducing the nursing staff, and its decision 
to do so is not invalid. 

 

 

9

23. 

Respondents argue that the district acted arbitrarily and capriciously in 

eliminating the positions of eight respondents in the adult school, positions which are wholly 
funded by federal funds under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act 
and the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.  These federal funds will be available, and will 
increase, for the 2010-2011 school year, and may not be used by the district for any purpose 
other than adult education.  For these reasons, respondents argue, there is no need to lay off 
the employees whose positions are federally-funded. 

 
Although the positions of these eight respondents are federally-funded, they work at 

an adult school that is supported by the district.  The district must use its own funds to 
provide administration, supervision, security, facility maintenance, and advertising for the 
adult school.  The board has decided to close the adult school and put the district’s funds to 
other uses.  Assistant Superintendent Becnel testified that the district has been unable to 
determine how the eight federally-funded employees could continue to function without the 
support provided by the district.  Her testimony was credible and persuasive.  It is within the 
board’s discretion to conclude that it cannot continue to support the adult school, even 
though the district will lose certain restricted federal funds in the process.  The evidence does 
not establish that the board acted arbitrarily to eliminate federally-funded positions in the 
adult school, and its decision to do so is not invalid.  
 
Other matters 
 

24. 

The cause for the reduction in particular kinds of services relates to the welfare 

of the schools and the pupils thereof. 

 
25. 

 
26. 

  

Except as to those music teachers who have been prejudiced by the district’s 
decision to skip employees who teach a music course at the high school level (Findings 10 
through 15), no permanent employee is being terminated while any probationary employee, 
or any other employee with less seniority, is being retained to render a service which the 
permanent employee is certificated and competent to render. 

 Any contentions raised by respondents and not discussed above have been  

found to be without merit and are hereby rejected. 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

 
 
By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 10 through 15, cause exists to 
require the district to identify the most senior employees who have been prejudiced by the 
district’s invalid skips and to rescind the layoff notices issued to those employees. 
 

2. 

Cause exists because of the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of
