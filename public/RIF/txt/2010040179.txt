On May 5, 2010, Respondents’ counsel submitted a document pertaining to Respondent 
Mashburn. Submission of this document was not authorized. Moreover, the document itself does 
not  indicate  that  it  was  sent  to  District’s  counsel,  so  lack  of  objection  cannot  be  assumed.

Respondents are certificated employees of the District. 

Superintendent Crawford filed the Accusation in his official capacity. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
On  March  10,  2010,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  (Governing  Board) 
adopted  Resolution  Number  10-15,  reducing  self-contained  classroom  instruction  in  Grades 
Kindergarten to Sixth by 27 full time equivalent positions.  
 
Superintendent  Crawford  thereafter  provided  written  notice  to  the  Governing 
 
Board and to Respondents that he recommended the termination of Respondents’ services for the 
2010-2011 school year due to the reduction of particular kinds of services.  
 
On  March  12,  2010,  the  District  provided  notice  to  Respondents  that  their 
 
services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2010-2011  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of  particular 
kinds of services. Respondents filed timely requests for hearing.  
 
 
On April 8, 2010, the District filed and served the Accusation and other required 
documents on Respondents. Respondents thereafter timely filed Notices of Defense, seeking a 
determination of whether cause exists for not reemploying them for the 2010-2011 school year.  
 
 
 
 
which may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.1  
 
 
arbitrary nor capricious but is rather a proper exercise of the District's discretion. 
 
 
The  reduction  of  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number  3  is  related  to  the 
welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of 
certificated employees as determined by the Governing Board. 
 
Several Respondents challenged their given seniority date of August 13, 
 
2007,  because  it  did  not  take  into  account  attendance  at  District-provided  training  before  they 
started imparting instruction. All hold multiple subject credentials, and are providing elementary 
school instruction.   
 
 

The services set forth in factual finding number 3 are particular kinds of services 

The  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  is  neither 

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.

Respondent  Mashburn  attended  a  training  on  August  8,  2007,  called 

Respondent  Chairez  attended  an  August  8,  2007,  training  session  called 
 
“Frontloading Academic Language for EL,” in which she received instruction on techniques for 
teaching  English  Language  learners  (EL).  A  site  administrator  told  her  that  the  class  was  a 
prerequisite to teach EL students.  
 
 
Respondent Cisneros attended the August 8, 2007, EL language class, and 
a training class on the same date about a new interactive blackboard called “Smart Board.” The 
latter was a requirement for teachers who wanted to have the Smart Board in their classrooms.  
 
 
Respondent  Elysee  attended  Language  Arts  training  on  August  6,  2007. 
Her site administrator, whose name she did not remember, told Respondent Elysee that she had 
to attend the training in order for the school to retain its status as a grant recipient.  
 
 
“Write From The Beginning,” and which covered the curriculum to be taught at her school. 
 
 
All  teachers  and  administrators  who  attended  the  foregoing  in-service 
training  were  paid  at  the  rate  of  $25  per  hour.  No  evidence  was  presented  regarding  the 
certificated employees’ regular rate of pay under their employment contract.  
 
 
Respondent Ornelaz has a seniority date of August 13, 2007. She holds a single 
subject credential that allows her to teach sewing and cooking in middle school. She is working 
towards attaining a single subject (Home Economics) credential.  
 
Respondent  Frankhouser  has  a  seniority  date  of  August  13,  2007,  and  holds  a 
 
multiple  subject  credential.    She  was  first  hired  in  August  2002,  voluntarily  resigned  in  June 
2006, and was rehired on August 13, 2007.  
 
Respondent Sward was first hired by the District on March 13, 2002, and attained 
 
permanent status in August 2004. She voluntarily resigned her employment on June 30, 2007, 
and was rehired on January 25, 2008, as a long-term substitute. She started a regular assignment 
the  following  school  year,  and  was  given  a  seniority  of  date  of  August  11,  2008.  Respondent 
Sward holds a multiple subject credential.

within the meaning of section 44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 3 and 8.   
 
 
Cause exists under sections 44949 and 44955 for the reduction of the particular 
kinds of services set forth in factual finding number 3, which cause relates solely to the welfare 
of the District's schools and pupils, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 15.  
 
 
The seniority date of a certificated employee is defined as the date the employee 
“first rendered paid service in a probationary capacity.” (§ 44845.)  These words must be given 
their  plain  and  commonsense  meaning  in  order  to  effectuate  the  legislative  intent.  (Hughes  v. 
Board of Architectural Examiners (1998) 17 Cal.4th 763, 775; California Teachers Assn. v. 
Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School District (1997) 14 Cal.4th 627, 632-633; Steketee v. 
Lintz,  Williams  &  Rothberg  (1985)  38  Cal.3d  46,  51-52.)  The  statute  requires  crediting  a 
certificated  employee  with  the  seniority  date  on  which  he  or  she  was  first  paid  to  render 
service in a probationary capacity. The statute does not expressly require a particular salary rate 
or  schedule,  a  particular  type  of  service  in  a  probationary  capacity,  or  that  the  service  be 
“mandatory.” 
 
Respondents Chairez, Cisneros, Elysee, and Mashburn were hired to render services in a 
 
probationary  capacity  and  the  training  in  question  was  provided  in  connection  with  such 
services. In each case, the training pertained to the subject matter the certificated employee was 
expected to teach during the school year. In some cases, namely those of Respondents Cisneros 
and Elysee, the training was a prerequisite to use certain equipment or to teach a class. In the 
case  of  Respondent  Elysee,  the  instruction  provided  in  her  in-service  training  provided  some 
tangible benefit to the District.  
 
 
If the date on which the employee first rendered paid service in a probationary capacity is 
incorrect,  the  employee’s  seniority  date  must  be  adjusted  to  reflect  the  earlier  first  date  of 
probationary service. (Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v. Bakersfield City School 
District (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1273.) 
 
 
 
Accordingly,  the  seniority  dates  of  Respondents  Chairez,  Cisneros,  Elysee,  and 
Mashburn,  and  those  of  all  other  certificated  employees  who  attended  District  in-services  in 
2007, must be adjusted to reflect their earlier first date of paid service in a probationary capacity. 
However, even after this adjustment, these Respondents remain junior to those retained to render 
services which the Respondents are certificated and competent to render. 
 
 
Section 44848 provides, in pertinent part, that, “When any certificated employee 
shall have resigned or been dismissed for cause and shall thereafter have been reemployed by the 
board,  his  date  of  employment  shall  be  deemed  the  date  on  which  he  first  .  .  .  rendered  paid 
service (if reemployed after June 30, 1947) after his reemployment.”  Another pertinent section, 
44931,  cited  by  Respondent  Sward,  provides:  “Whenever  any  certificated  employee  of  any 
school  district  who,  at  the  time  of  his  or  her  resignation,  was  classified  as  permanent,  is 

5.

The District correctly calculated Respondent Frankhouser’s seniority date under section 

reemployed within 39 months after his or her last day of paid service, the governing board of the 
district shall, disregarding the break in service, classify him or her as, and restore to him or her 
all the rights, benefits and burdens of, a permanent employee, except as otherwise provided in 
this  code.  .  .  .”    In  San  Jose  Teachers  Association  v.  Allen  (1983)  144  Cal.App.3d  627  (San 
Jose), the court held that section 44931 was subject to the limitations contained in section 44848.  
 
 
44848.  
 
 
Respondent  Sward’s  actual  reemployment  date  is  January  25,  2008.  Although 
Respondent Sward was reemployed as a long-term substitute, neither section 44848 nor 44931 
qualify the type of employment a rehired employee must discharge, and both simply refer to date 
of “reemployment.”  Her correct seniority date is, therefore, January 25, 2008.  However, as was 
the case with the Respondents set forth in legal conclusion number 4, even after this adjustment, 
Respondent Sward remains junior to those retained to render services which she is certificated 
and competent to render. 
 
Cause exists to terminate the services of Respondents Chairez, Cisneros, Elysee, 
 
Frankhouser, Leija, Mashburn, Ornelaz, Saldana, and Sward for the 2010-2011 school year due 
to the reduction of particular kinds of services, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 
15, and legal conclusion numbers 1 through 5.

ORDER 

 
The  Accusations  are  sustained  and  the  District  may  notify  Respondents  Chairez, 
 
Cisneros, Elysee, Frankhouser, Leija, Mashburn, Ornelaz, Saldana, and Sward that their services 
will not be needed during the 2010-2011 school year due to the reduction of particular kinds of 
services.
