FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1. 

David E. Hutt, Ed.D., is the Superintendent of the San Bruno Park School 

District (District).  The actions of Superintendent Hutt, and those of the District’s staff and 
Governing Board (Board), were taken solely in their official capacities.  

 
2. 

  
3. 

Kelsey Baxter, Jennifer Carrade, Laura Gianino, Amanda Hall, Sara-Maria 

Menendez, Kimberly O’Brien, Rebeca Schurr, Erin Soltis, Olivia Taylor, Brigit Tuxen and 
Kendra Weldin (respondents) are all certificated permanent employees of the District.  Four 
notices were rescinded at the beginning of the hearing:  Margarita Gibson, Amanda Hession, 
Ashley Timmington, and Diana Yu.  

On March 12, 2015, Superintendent Hutt recommended to the Board, pursuant 
to Education Code sections 44949, 44955, and other applicable provisions of law, that notice

be given to respondents that the teachers’ services will not be required for the ensuing 2015-
2016 school year, and stating the reasons therefor.     
 

4. 

On February 11, 2015, the Board adopted Resolution No. 15-03-01, reducing 
or eliminating particular kinds of services (PKS) of the District, and affecting 17 Full Time 
Equivalent (FTE) certificated positions. 

The Resolution states that it will be necessary to reduce the following PKS of 
the District, and to decrease a corresponding number of certificated employees in the District 
no later than the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year:  
 

SERVICE 
Elementary School Teaching 
Reading Intervention Teacher (CAT) 
Middle School 6th Grade Core 
Middle School Technology 
Special Education Day Class Teacher 
Resource Specialist Teacher 
Total 

FTE 
11.0 
1.0 
1.0 
1.0 
         1.0 
         2.0 
        17.0 

6. 

The services set forth in the PKS Resolution are “particular kinds of services” 
that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.  
There was no evidence that the Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the identified 
services was arbitrary or capricious.  The reduction or elimination of the services set forth in 
the PKS Resolution constituted a proper exercise of the Board’s discretion, within the 
meaning of section 44955.   

As a result of the above PKS reductions and/or eliminations, the Board 

determined that it was necessary to decrease 17.0 FTE positions of certificated employees in 
the District at the close of the 2014-2015 school year, in accordance with Education Code 
section 44955. 
 
8. 

On March 12, 2015, Superintendent Hutt gave respondents written notice, 

pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 of the recommendation to the Board 
that respondents’ services would be reduced for the ensuing school year, and the reasons 
therefor. 

Respondents timely filed a Request for Hearing to determine whether there 

was cause for not reemploying each of them full-time for the 2015-2016 school year. 

 
10.  On April 1, 2015, Superintendent Hutt made and filed the District’s Statement 

of Reduction in Force, and caused it to be served on respondents.  Each respondent timely 
filed a Notice of Participation requesting a hearing in this matter.  Two teachers, Sandra 
Handly and Kristina Renda did not request a hearing.

TIE BREAKING CRITERIA 

sections 44949 and 44955. 
 
Respondents’ Contentions 
 
 
 
 
12.  On February 2, 2009, the District adopted Criteria to Determine the Order of 
Termination Among Certificated Employees with the Same First Date of Paid Service.  The 
tie breaking criteria was applied to teachers hired August 26, 2013: Amanda Hession, Ashley 
Timmington and Diana Yu.  Each of these teachers will be retained. 
 
 
multiple subject preliminary teaching credentialed teachers (Baxter, Taylor, Menendez, 
O’Brien, Renda, and Schurr) had three points.  A lottery was held to determine further order 
of seniority.  Two of the multiple subject preliminary teaching credentialed teachers (Hall 
and Carrade) had two points each.  A lottery was held to determine the order of seniority for 
these two teachers.  No evidence was presented to show that the tie breaking criteria was 
applied incorrectly.   
 

The tie breaking criteria was applied to teachers hired August 25, 2014.  Six of the 

MANDATED SERVICES 

13. 

14. 

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), provides:  “Except as 

Special Education Services are mandated services.  It was established through 

 
 
the testimony of Superintendent Hutt that the mandated services would not go below those 
required by law.  A final plan is not in place to show how the assignments will be made, but 
a preliminary plan including increasing class size to legally allowed limits and consolidating 
sites where the services will be delivered is being considered to accomplish the delivery of 
       
mandated special education services.       
 
 
otherwise provided by statute, the services of no permanent employee may be terminated 
under the provisions of this section while any probationary employee, or any other employee 
with less seniority, is retained to render a service which said permanent employee is 
certificated and competent to render.”   
 
 
board shall make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that employees shall be 
retained to render any service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render.”   
 
 
 
 
 
    

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (c), further provides:  “The governing 

The District has complied with this provision of the law.

Welfare of the District and Its Students 
 

15. 

The cause for not re-employing certificated employees relates solely to the 

welfare of the District’s schools, programs and the pupils thereof within the meaning of 
Education Code section 44949.  The Superintendent and his staff correctly identified the 
certificated employees providing the particular kinds of services that the Board directed be 
reduced or discontinued.  No junior certificated employee is scheduled to be retained to 
perform services which a more senior employee is certificated and competent to render. 

 
Any further attrition experience by the District must result in retention of certificated 

16.  Any other assertions raised by the parties at hearing which are not addressed 

employees in order of seniority. 
 
 
above are found to be without merit. 
 
 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to Education Code sections 
44949 and 44955.  All notices and other jurisdictional requirements of sections 44949 and 
44955 were met. 
  

2. 

A District may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955, 

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not, 
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that 
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to 
deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 
178-179.)  The burden is on the District to demonstrate that the reduction or elimination of 
the particular kinds of services is reasonable and that the District carefully considered its 
needs before laying off any certificated employee.  (Campbell Elementary Teachers 
Association v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 807-808.)   

The services identified in PKS Resolution No. 15-03-01 are particular kinds of 

services that may be reduced or discontinued pursuant to sections 44949 and 44955.  The 
description of services to be reduced, both in the Board’s Resolution and in the notice, 
adequately described particular kinds of services.  (Zalac v. Ferndale USD (2002) 98 
Cal.App.4th 838; see, also, Degener v. Governing Board (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 689.) 
 

4. 

Legal cause exists to reduce or eliminate 17.0 FTE of particular kinds of 

services offered by the District as set forth in detail in the Factual Findings.  The Board’s 
decision to reduce or discontinue the identified services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, 
and was a proper exercise of its discretion.  Cause for the reduction or discontinuance of 
services relates solely to the welfare of the District’s schools and pupils within the meaning 
of Education Code section 44949.

5. 

Cause exists for the reduction of the particular kinds of services and for the 
reduction of full-time equivalent certificated positions at the end of the 2014-2015 school 
year pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.  No employee with less seniority 
than respondents is being retained to render a service which respondents are certificated and 
competent to render.  The District’s Board of Trustees may give final notice to respondents, 
that each teacher’s services will be reduced up to 1.0 FTE for the ensuing school year, 2015-
2016. 
 
 

RECOMMENDATION 

Cause exists for the reduction of 17.0 full-time equivalent certificated positions at the 

 
 
end of the 2014-2015 school year.  Notice shall be given to respondents that each teacher’s 
services will be reduced up to 1.0 FTE for the ensuing school year, 2015-2016, because of 
the reduction and discontinuance of particular kinds of services.  Notices shall be given in 
inverse order of seniority.
