FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

On  February  25,  2004,  the  Solano  County  Superintendent  of  Schools  adopted 
Resolution  No.  S03-04-01  eliminating  six  full-time  equivalent  (FTE)  juvenile  hall,  court  and 
community  school  teacher  positions  no  later  than  the  beginning  of  the  2004-2005  school 
year,  and  directing  that  the  appropriate  notices  be  sent  to  all  employees  whose  positions 
might  be  lost  as  a  result  of  this  action. 

2. 

On  February  27,  2004,  the  associate  superintendent  gave  written  notice,  under 

Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955,  to  six  certificated  employees  that  it  had  been 
recommended  that  they  not  be  reemployed  for  the  2004-2005  school  year. 

Four  of  the  employees  receiving  these  notices  filed  timely  notices  requesting  a 

hearing  to  determine  if  there  was  cause  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  2004-2005  school 
year.  One  of  those  employees  was  respondent  Maurice  Washington. 

4. 

Washington  is  the  only  respondent  still  subject  to  termination  in  this 
proceeding;  the  notices  sent  to  the  other  three  respondents,  all  of  whom  are  senior  to 
Washington,  have  been  rescinded.

3. 

   

5. 

The  parties  stipulated  that  Washington’s  seniority  date  is  February  8,  1989. 
He  is  senior  to  another  court  and  community  school  teacher  who  is  not  being  terminated— 
Carol  Harris.  However,  the  parties  stipulated  that  Harris  serves  as  a  literacy  facilitator,  a 
position  in  which  Washington  is  not  competent  to  serve  because  he  lacks  the  requisite 
training  in  literacy  and  reading.  Washington  is  also  senior  to  court  and  community  school 
teacher  Shelly  L.  Nissen.  Nissen  was  one  of  the  six  employees  served  with  the  February  27, 
2004  notice  referred  to  in  Finding  2.  She  did  not  request  a  hearing  and  is  not  a  respondent  in 
this  proceeding.  The  parties  stipulated  that  Washington  will  be  the  first  employee  recalled 
should  it  not  be  necessary  to  terminate  two  FTE  positions. 

. 

6. 

The  parties  stipulated  that  Michael  Golomb  has  correctly  been  given  a 

seniority  date  of  September  15,  1981.  Golomb  attained  tenure  as  a  teacher  in  the  county 
office  by  virtue  of  his  service  in  that  position  for  nearly  six  years  before  becoming  a  principal 
on  July  1,  1987. 

7. 
have  been  met. 

The  parties  stipulated  that  all  jurisdictional  requirements  for  this  proceeding 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

Because  of  the  reduction  of  a  particular  kind  of  service—juvenile  hall  and  court  and 

community  teacher  positions—cause  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955 
to  give  notice  to  respondent  Maurice  Washington  that  his  services  will  not  be  required  for  the 
2004-2005  school  year. 

ORDER 

Notice  may  be  given  respondent  Maurice  Washington  that  his  services  will  not  be 

required  for  the  2004-2005  school  year.
