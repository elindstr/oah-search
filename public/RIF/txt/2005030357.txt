3. 

On  March  14,  2005,  upon  the  recommendation  of  Superintendent  Daniel 

_ 
Callahan,  the  governing  board  of  the  Monterey  Peninsula  Unified  School  District  adopted 
Resolution  No.  04/05-123,  in  which  the  board  resolved  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the 
following  particular  kinds  of  services  for  the  2005-2006  school  year  and  directed  the 
superintendent  or  his  designee  to  send  notice  to  certificated  employees  that  their  services 
would  be  terminated  at  the  end  of  the  2004-2005  school  year: 

Elementary  School  Classroom  Teachers  (K-5) 

12.0  FTE 

Total  Full-Time  Equivalent  Reduction 

  

4. 

As  a  result  of  the  March  7  and  March  14,  2005,  resolutions,  the  district  plans  a 

reduction  of  42.5  FTE  (full-time  equivalent)  positions. 

5. 

Respondents  are  certificated  employees  of  the  district.  All  respondents  were 
properly  and  timely  served  with  notice  of  layoff.  All  respondents  were  properly  and  timely 
served  an  accusation,  statement  to  respondent,  notice  of  defense,  notice  of  hearing,  and 
relevant  statutes.  All  respondents,  except  Stephanie  Wright,  have  made  a  timely  request  for 
hearing  and  timely  notice  of  defense.  Stephanie  Wright  did  not  file  a  notice  of  defense  in 
this  matter,  and  was  not  present  or  otherwise  represented.  All  jurisdictional  requirements  of 
Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  have  been  met. 

6. 

A  total  of  16  certificated  employees  notified  the  district  before  March  15, 

2005,  that  they  will  resign  or  retire  at  the  end  of  the  2004-2005  school  year.  The  governing 
board  took  those  resignations  and  retirements  into  consideration  in  coming  to  its  resolutions 
to  reduce  or  eliminate  particular  kinds  of  services.  Those  resignations  and  retirements  do  not 
reduce  the  number  of  employees  to  be  terminated. 

7. 

Since  the  March  7  and  March  14,  2005,  resolutions,  10  certificated  employees 

have  notified  the  district  that  they  will  resign  or  retire  at  the  end  of  the  2004-2005  school 
year.  Seven  of  those  employees  are  elementary  school  classroom  teachers,  a  service  being 
reduced  or  discontinued  under  the  board  resolutions;  the  other  three  teach  in  subjects  not 
being  reduced  or  discontinued.  The  resignations  and  retirements  of  the  seven  elementary 
school  classroom  teachers  constitute  “positively  assured  attrition”  that  reduces  by  seven  the 
number  of  elementary  school  classroom  teachers  the  district  may  terminate.  (Lewin  v.  Board 
of  Trustees  (1976)  62  Cal.App.3d  977,  982.) 

8. 

At  its  March  7,  2005,  meeting,  the  board  also  adopted  resolutions  to  non- 

reelect  emergency  credentialed  employees  and  to  release  temporary  certificated  employees. 
The  release  of  those  employees  does  not  create  vacancies  into  which  respondents  are  entitled 
to  move. 

9. 

In  determining  which  permanent  and  probationary  employees  would  be 

subject  to  layoff  in  this  proceeding,  the  district  elected  to  “skip”  teachers  possessing 
Bilingual,  Crosscultural  Language  and  Academic  Development  (BCLAD)  certificates. 
Resolution  No.  04/05-18  and  Resolution  04/05-23  contained  no  authorization  for  skipping 
any  employees.  A  district  may  deviate  from  terminating  employees  in  strict  seniority  order  if 
it  demonstrates  a  specific  need  to  retain  junior  employees  possessing  training  or  experience 
that  more  senior  employees  do  not  have.  Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (d), 
gives  the  authority  for  making  these  skipping  determinations  to  the  district;  it  does  not 
require  pre-March  15  board  action. 

10. 

The  district  has  a  shortage  of  teachers  qualified  to  teach  bilingual  classes,  and 
may  be  out  of  compliance  with  legal  requirements  to  provide  bilingual  education.  Teachers 
with  BCLAD  certificates  are  qualified  to  teach  bilingual  classes,  but  teachers  with  such

certification  are  difficult  to  find.  Teacher  Veronica  Valencia  possesses  a  BCLAD  certificate, 
and  currently  teaches  a  bilingual  class  for  the  district.  The  district  intends  to  skip  Valencia 
because  of  her  BCLAD  certification.  Valencia  will  again  be  teaching  a  bilingual  class  in  the 
2005-2006  school  year,  and  is  appropriately  being  skipped. 

11. 

At  its  March  7,  2005,  meeting,  the  board  adopted  Resolution  No.  04/05-17, 
which  established  tie-breaking  criteria  to  be  used  to  determine  the  order  of  termination  of 
employees  having  the  same  seniority  date.  In  the  tie-breaking  process,  employees  earn 
points  in  five  specified  criteria.  If  a  tie  remains  after  application  of  the  five  criteria,  a  sixth 
criterion  is  applied,  under  which  the  employee  receives  one  point  for  each  college/university 
semester  unit  or  district  unit  earned  after  the  bachelor’s  degree.  A  teacher’s  tie-breaker  score 
is  listed  in  two  parts,  for  example  17/63,  in  which  17  is  the  teacher’s  point  total  under  the 
first  five  criteria  and  63  is  the  teacher’s  score  under  the  sixth  criterion. 

12. 

Erica  Clay  is  a  sixth  grade  teacher  employed  by  the  district.  She  is  listed 

number  46  on  the  district’s  seniority  list,  with  a  seniority  date  of  July  26,  2004.  The  district 
does  not  plan  to  reduce  or  discontinue  any  sixth  grade  teaching  positions,  but  appropriately 
gave  Clay a  notice  of  layoff  because  more  senior  employees  qualified  to  teach  sixth  grade 
may  “bump”  Clay.

13. 

James  Fortune  teaches  at  Seaside  High  School.  He  is  listed  number  35  on  the 
district’s  seniority  list,  with  a  seniority  date  of  July  28,  2004.  Fortune  worked  as  a  substitute 
teacher  for  the  district  in  prior  school  years,  but  the  evidence  did  not  establish  how  many 
days  Fortune  worked  in  those  years.  Starting  around  July  21,  2004,  Fortune  attended  an 
“AVID”  training  program  in  Sacramento.  The  district  did  not  pay  Fortune  for  his  attendance 
at  the  training,  but  did  reimburse  his  travel  and  lodging  expenses.  The  evidence  did  not 
establish  that  Fortune’s  attendance  at  the  training  was  mandatory,  or  that  his  first  date  of  paid 
service  in  a  probationary  position  was  other  than  July  28,  2004. 

14. 

Robin  Jensen  teaches  at  teaches  at  Seaside  High  School.  She  is  listed  number 

13  on  the  district’s  seniority  list,  with  a  seniority  date  of  September  27,  2004,  and a tie- 
breaker  score  of  15/112.  Jensen  and  the  district  stipulated  that  her  correct  tie-breaker  score  is 
22/119. 

15. 

.  Desma  Johnson  teaches  Spanish  and  English  at  Seaside  High  School.  She  is 
listed  number  79  on  the  district’s  seniority  list,  with  a  seniority  date  of  August  4,  2003.  She 
began  teaching  for  the  district  on  January  6,  2003,  with  an  emergency  credential.  Johnson  is 
one  of  only  two  African  American  teachers  at  Seaside  High  School,  which  has a largely 
_  minority  student  body.  Johnson  did  not  establish  that  she  may  be  retained  for  purposes  of 
maintaining  racial  or  ethnic  diversity.  At  hearing,  the  district  stipulated  that  Johnson’s 
seniority  date  is  January  6,  2003. 

16. 

Donna  Koenig  is  a  physical  education  teacher  at  Seaside  High  School.  She  is 

listed  number  30  on  the  district’s  seniority  list,  with  a  seniority  date  of  August  2,  2004. 
Koenig  taught  as  a  substitute  teacher  in  the  2003-2004  school  year,  starting  October  27,

  

2003.  The  evidence  did  not  establish  how  many  days  Koenig  worked  in  the  2003-2004 
school  year.  Koenig  is  the  only  female  physical  education  teacher  at  Seaside  High  School. 
Female  supervision  for  girls’  physical  education  is  required,  but  the  district  will  be  able  to 
assign  other  female  employees  to  provide  this  function  if  necessary.  The  evidence  did  not 
establish  that  Koenig’s  seniority  date  is  incorrect,  or  that  she  must  be  retained  to  provide 
female  supervision  for  girls’  physical  education  at  Seaside  High  School. 

17. 

Anthony  Morales  teaches  at  Central  Coast  High  School.  He  is  listed  number 

102  on  the  district’s  seniority  list,  with  a  seniority  date  of  July  28,  2003,  and  a  tie-breaker 
score  of  15/72.66.  Morales  and  the  district  stipulated  that  his  15/72.66  tie-breaker  score  is 
correct. 

18. 

Cheryl  Redding  is  a  second  grade  teacher  at  J.C.  Crumpton  Elementary 

School.  She  is  listed  number  50  on  the  district’s  seniority  list,  with  a  seniority  date  of  July 
26,  2004.  Redding  worked  as  a  substitute  teacher  for  the  district  in  prior  school  years.  The 
evidence  did  not  establish  how  many  days  Redding  worked  in  prior  school  years.  Redding 
attended  a  Houghton  Mifflin  reading  workshop  that  began  July  21,  2004,  and  was  paid  a 
stipend  by  the  district  for  her  attendance.  The  evidence  did  not  establish  that  Redding’s 
attendance  at  the  workshop  was  mandatory,  or  that  her  first  date  of  paid  service  in  a 
probationary  position  was  other  than  July  26,  2004. 

19. 

Allyson  Schweifler  teaches  at  Ord  Terrace  Elementary  School.  She  is  listed 

number  48  on  the  district’s  seniority  list,  with  a  seniority  date  of  July  26,  2004.  Starting  July 
20,  2004,  Schweifler  attended  an  “AB  466  Harcourt”  math  training  program,  and  was  paid  a 
stipend  by  the  district  for  her  attendance.  The  evidence  did  not  establish  that  Schweifler’s 
attendance  at  the  training  program  was  mandatory,  or  that  her  first  date  of  paid  service  in  a 
probationary  position  was  other  than  July  26,  2004. 

20. 

Bryan  Shaw  teaches  health  and  social  science  at  Seaside  High  School.  He  is 
listed  number  93  on  the  district’s  seniority  list,  with  a  seniority  date  of  July  28,  2003,  and  a 
tie-breaker  score  of  11/57.  Shaw  and  the  district  stipulated  that  his  correct  tie-breaker  score 
is  17/63.  Shaw  and  the  district  further  stipulated  that  the  accusation  against  him  will  be 
rescinded.  In  the  2005-2006  school  year,  Shaw  will  only  be  teaching  health. 

21. 

|  No  permanent  or  probationary  employee  with  less  seniority  is  being  retained 

to  render  a  service  for  which  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Cause  for  the  elimination  of  42.5  FTE  positions  exists  in  accordance  with 

Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  This  cause  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the 
district  and  the  pupils  thereof. 

2. 

The  district  must  use  the  resignations  and  retirements  of  seven  elementary 

school  classroom  teachers  to  reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  whose

employment  will  be  terminated  (Factual  Finding  7).  Prior  to  issuing  final  notices  of 
termination,  the  district  shall  also  consider  additional  positively  assured  attrition  in  services 
being  reduced  or  discontinued  occurring  up  to  the  date  of  the  board’s  final  action  in  this 
matter. 

3. 

The  district  has  appropriately  skipped  Veronica  Valencia,  who  will  continue  to 
teach  a  bilingual  class  (Factual  Findings  9  and  10).  Accordingly,  notice  shall  not  be  given  to 
Valencia  that  her  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2005-2006  school  year. 

The  district  shall  correct  Robin  Jensen’s  tie-breaker  score  to  22/119  (Factual 

Finding  14). 

(Factual  Finding  15). 

4. 

5. 

6. 

The  district  shall  correct  Desma  Johnson’s  seniority  date  to  January  6,  2003 

The  district  has  stipulated  that  Bryan  Shaw’s  correct  tie-breaker  score  is  17/63 

and  further  that  the  district  will  rescind  the  accusation  against  him  (Factual  Finding  20). 
Accordingly,  the  district  shall  correct  Shaw’s  tie-breaker  score,  and  shall  not  notify  Shaw 
that  his  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2005-2006  school  year. 

7. 

All  contentions  made  by  respondents  not  specifically  addressed  above  are 

found  to  be  without  merit  and  are  rejected. 

ORDER 

Except  as  limited  by  Legal  Conclusions  1  through  7,  inclusive,  notice  may  be  given  to 

respondents  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2005-2006  school  year.
