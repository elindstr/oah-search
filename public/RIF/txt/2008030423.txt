FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

Ronald  F.  Crates,  Superintendent,  Hollister  School  District,  made  and  filed  the 

accusations  in  his  official  capacity. 

2. 

On  March  4,  2008,  upon  the  recommendation of  Superintendent  Crates,  the 
board of trustees of  the  Hollister  School  District  adopted  Resolution  No.  16:07-08,  which 
authorized  the  reduction  or  discontinuance of particular  kinds  of  services  of  60.62  FTE  (full- 
time  equivalent)  certificated  positions  in  the  2008  —  2009  school  year.  The  resolution  also 
authorized  the  reduction of  9.0  FTE  certificated  positions  due  to  a  decline  in  average  daily 
attendance  (ADA).  The  board  directed  the  superintendent  or  his  designee  to  send  notice  to 
certificated  employees  that  their  services  would  be  terminated  at  the  end  of  the  2007  —  2008 
school  year. 

 

  

3. 

At  hearing,  the  district  withdrew  the  9.0  FTE  ADA  reduction.  The  district  also 
amended  the  particular  kinds  of  services  to  be  reduced  or  eliminated  to  36.72  FTE.  Thus,  the 
following  FTE  reductions  are  at  issue: 

Administrative  Services  —  Coordinator 
Kindergarten  Teacher 
First  Grade  Teacher 
Second  Grade  Teacher 
Third  Grade  Teacher 
Fourth  Grade  Teacher 
Fifth  Grade  Teacher 
Adaptive  Physical  Education  Teacher

4. 

The  district  anticipates  that  it  will  have  a  budget  reduction  of  approximately 

$3.1  million  for  the  2008  —  2009  school  year.  The  particular  kinds  of  services  listed  in 
Factual  Finding  3  are  being  reduced  or  eliminated  in  order  to  meet  the  budget  reduction. 
These  services  are  particular  kinds  of  service  that  may  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the 
meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955.  The  district  is  also  reducing  services  provided  by 
administrators  and  classified  employees. 

5. 

Respondents  are  full-time  or  part-time  certificated  employees of  the  district. 

All  respondents  were  properly  and  timely  served  with  notice  of  layoff.  All  respondents  were 
properly  and  timely  served  an  accusation,  statement  to  respondent,  notice  of  defense,  notice 
All  jurisdictional  requirements  of  Education  Code  sections 
of  hearing,  and  relevant  statutes. 
44949  and  44955  have  been  met. 

6. 

The  district  has  withdrawn  the  accusations  previously  issued  against  Summer 

Chamblin,  Marilyn  Cline,  Kimberly  Gaither,  Alec  Griffin,  Matthew  Hudson,  Kenneth 
Johnson,  Morgan  Marquez,  Virginia  Pender,  and  Timothy  Peters.  The  accusations  against 
them  will  be  dismissed. 

 

7. 

The  district  served  non-reelection  notices  on  probationary  certificated 

employees  Amy  Anderson,  Roger  Brown,  Steven  DeCaro,  Francisco  Eclarin,  Leigh  Hill, 
Deborah  Kampf,  Deanna  Lane,  Elizabeth  Rogers,  Matthew  Romiti,  Pamela  Smith,  and 
Barbara  Taddeo.  The  employees  were  non-reelected  pursuant  to  Education  Code  section 
44929.21  and  are  outside the  jurisdiction  of  these  proceedings. 

8. 

The  district  took  attrition  before  and  after  March  15,  2008,  into  account  in 

determining  the  number  of  teachers  to  receive  layoff  notices  and  in  withdrawing  accusations 
issued  to  various  respondents.  The  attrition  considered  by  the  district  included  probationary 
employee  non-reelections,  resignations,  retirements,  temporary  teacher  releases,  and 
approved  certificated  employee  leave  of  absence  requests  for  2008  —  2009. 

9. 

The  district  will  comply  with  state  mandates  and  provisions  of  the  collective 
bargaining  agreement  with  the  Hollister  Elementary  Teachers  Association  regarding  class 
size. 

The  proposed  reductions  and  discontinuances  of  particular  kinds of  services 

will  not  reduce  district  services  below  legally  mandated  levels. 

On  February  5,  2008,  the  district’s  board of  trustees  adopted  Resolution  No. 

14:07-08.  The  resolution  set  forth  six  criteria  (“tie  breaker  criteria”),  “not  in  order  of 
priority,”  to  be  used  in  determining  the  order  of  termination  of  certificated  employees  first 
rendering  paid  service  to  the  district  on  the  same  date: 

10. 

11. 

1)  Breadth  of  credential  authorization. 

¢ 

Multiple  credentials,  allowing  flexibility  of  assignment  and  ability  to 
undertake  multiple  assignments  as  District’s  needs  change. 

: 

2)  No  Child  Left  Behind  highly  qualified  teacher  status  for 

current  assignment[.] 

3)  Advanced  degrees  in  current  assignment  or  credential- 

related  subject  areas[.] 

4)  Greatest  number  of  post-BA  accredited  college  units  on file 
with  the  District  in  current  assignment  or  credential-related 
areas|.] 

5)  Teaching  experience  in  multiple  subjects  or  grade  levels  in 

areas  of  anticipated  need. 

6)  Greatest  number  of  years  teaching  in  California  public 
elementary  and  secondary  schools  outside  the  District. 

  

 

  

The  resolution  directed  the  superintendent  or  his  designee  “to  apply  the  adopted 
criteria  to  the  affected  employees  to  determine  order  of  termination  as  related  to  the  needs  of 
the  District  and  its  students.” 

12. 

On  February  7,  2008,  Assistant  Superintendent  Dennis  Kurtz  sent  to  teachers 
potentially  impacted  by  the  tie  breaker  criteria  a  memorandum  explaining  the  procedure  for 
applying  the  tie  breaker  criteria  and  attaching  a  tie  breaker  worksheet.  The  memorandum  set 
forth  point  values  to  be  assigned  to  the  six  tie  breaker  criteria  adopted  by  the  board: 

Column  1:  Breadth  of  Credential  —  For  every  credential, 
certificate  or  authorization from  the  CCTC,  you  receive  5  points. 
Certificates  earned  at  workshops,  and  credentials  not  from 
California  do  not  count. 

Column  2:  NCLB  HQT  status  —  Most  teachers  are Highly 
Qualified,  and  receive  10  points.  If  you  are  assigned  in  a 
subject  area  not  requiring  you  to  be  ‘Highly  Qualified’,  then  you 
receive  5  points.  Only  teachers  who  should  have  HQT  status, 
but  for  some  reason  do  not,  receive  0  points. 

Column  3:  Advanced  Degrees  —  For  every  Masters  or 
Doctorate  from  an  accredited  university  that  we  have  on  file  as 
of  September  10,  2007,  you  receive  5  points. 

#  of  Post-Baccalaureate  Accredited College 

Column  4: 
Units  —  For  each  semester  unit,  you  receive  1  point.  The 
Baccalaureate  can  be  either  a  BA  or  BS;  transcripts  had  to  have 
been  on  file  in  the  District  Office  as  of  September  10,  2007. 

Column  5:  Teaching  Experience  in  multiple  subjects/grade 
levels  —  This  one  is  complicated.  The  intent  is  to  give greater 
credit  to  those  teachers  who  have  taught  at  more  than  one  grade 
level,  or  in  more  than  one  subject  area  at  the  middle  school 
level.  For  every  different  such  assignment  in  the  Hollister 
School  District,  you  receive  2  points,  provided  you  taught  in 
that  assignment  for  a  year  or  more  (1  point  for  half a  year  or  for 
a  semester).  So,  some  examples;  if  you  have  taught  the  same 
grade  level  for  5  years,  you  receive  2  points.  If  you  have  taught 
for  5  years  —  2  years  at  2"  grade  and  3  years  at  1°  grade  —  you 
receive  4  points.  If  you  started  in  Kindergarten,  and  then 
changed  mid-year  for  some  reason  to  1“  grade,  followed  by  an 
entire  year  in  1"  grade,  then  you  receive  3  points  (1  for  Kinder 
[sic]  and  2  for  1*  grade),  Combination  classes  count  double,  so 
a  year  of  teaching  K/1  combo  receives  4  points.  In  Middle 
School,  for  example,  a  teacher  teaching  both  Language  Arts  and 

 

  

  

Social  Science  in  the  7"  and  8"  grades  for  a  year  receives  4 
points.  SDC  and  RSP  teachers  teach  students  at  multiple 
grades;  they  receive  6  points  for  each  assignment. 

#  of  Years  teaching  in  California  public  schools  — 
Column  6: 
You  receive  |  point  per  year  for  every  year  taught  in  California, 
whether  in  Hollister  or  not,  but  only  for  public  school  service. 

13. 

The  district  prefers  to  and  does  provide  departmentalized  instruction  in  its 
middle  schools.  Where  departmentalized  instruction  is  not  feasible  because of a  lack  of 
appropriately  credentialed  teachers,  the  district  also  provides  “core”  classes  taught  by 
teachers  with  multiple  subject  credentials,  particularly  in  the  sixth  grade.  Respondents  assert 
that  teachers  holding  multiple  subject  credentials  are  authorized  to  teach  in  “core”  classes  in 
the  district’s  middle  schools  and,  “To  the  extent  there  are  open  positions  in  these  CORE 
programs,  Respondents  holding  Multiple  Subject  credentials  should  be  retained  to  fill  those 
vacancies  in  order of  their  seniority.”  Respondents  did  not  identify  any  such  teachers. 

14. 

Respondent  Micaela  Hedden  has  met  the  requirements  for  a  BCLAD 

credential,  applied  for  the  credential  in  March  2008,  but  has  not  yet  received  it.  The  district 
is  not  required  to  recognize  this  credential  for  purposes  of  these  proceedings.

Jelinick  contends,  and  the  district  acknowledges,  that  she  should  be  awarded  two  additional 
tie  breaker  points.  Ms.  Jelinick  has  also  completed  the  requirements  for  a  single  subject 
credential,  except  for  a  CPR  (cardio  pulmonary  resuscitation)  class  that  will  be  given  in  early

Gabriel  Talavera  completed  a  10  quarter  unit  “NTP  BTSA  Year  1”  course  at 

the  University  of  California  Extension,  Santa  Cruz,  in  May  2007.  He  seeks  credit  for  6.7 
semester  units  (converted  from  quarter  units)  under  the  district’s  tie  breaker  criteria.  He 
submitted  those  units  for  district  recognition  in  July  2007,  but  his  request  was  “kicked  back” 
because  it  lacked  a  principal’s  signature.  The  request  was  not  resubmitted  until  after  the 
September  10,  2007  date  specified  in  the  tie  breaker  memorandum.  The  district  is  not 
required  to  recognize  the  units  for  the  purposes  of  computing  Talavera’s  tie  breaker points. 

21. 

No  permanent  or  probationary  employee  with  less  seniority  is  being  retained 

to  render  a  service  for  which  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Cause  for  the  elimination  of  36.72  FTE  positions  exists  in  accordance  with 
Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  This  cause  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the 
district  and  the  pupils  thereof. 

2. 

Respondents  contend  that  the  District  has  not  established  that  the  layoffs  are 
“related  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof”  as  required  by  Education  Code 
section  44949,  but  this  contention  is  without  merit.  In  determining  how  to  allocate  its 
resources,  a  school  district  is  given  discretion  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of 
services.  While  almost  any  reduction  or  elimination of services  is  arguably  detrimental  to  at 
least  some  students  (not  to  mention  school  employees),  in  the  absence  of  a  showing  that  the 
district’s  decision  is  arbitrary  or  capricious,  its  action  is  related  to  the  overall  welfare of  the 
schools  and  its  pupils.  In  this  case,  the  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of 
services  was  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious  but  rather  a  proper  exercise  of  the  district’s 
discretion. 

3. 

The  district  took  attrition  into  account  in  determining  the  number  of  teachers 

to  receive  layoff  notices  and  in  withdrawing  accusations  issued  to  various  respondents. 

4, 

Respondents  contend  that  the  district’s  administration  had  no  authority  to 
apply  tie  breaker  criteria  not  authorized  by  the  board  of  trustees  in  resolution  14:07-08. 
Respondents  note  that  the  resolution  contained  six  criteria  “not  in  order  of  priority”  and  did 
not  refer  to  any  “points”  to  be  assigned  to  the  criteria.  Respondents  assert  that  the  point 
values  set  forth  in  Assistant  Superintendent  Kurtz’s  February  7,  2008  memorandum  and 
worksheet  was  an  “improper  delegation  of  authority  and  an  unauthorized  modification of  the 
criteria  adopted  by  the  Governing  Board.” 

@  

The  board’s  delegation  of  authority  to  the  superintendent  or  his  designee  to  apply  the 
tie  breaker  criteria  was  not  improper.  The  administration’s  implementation  of  the  board’s  tie 
breaker  criteria  through  the  point  values  set  forth  in  Assistant  Superintendent  Kurtz’s 
February  7,  2008  memorandum  and  worksheet  were  properly  within  the  authority  delegated 
by  the  board  of  trustees,  with  the  possible  exception  of  criterion  6  (“Greatest  number  of  years 
teaching  in  California  public  elementary  and  secondary  schools  outside  the  District.”)  The 
February  7  memorandum  granted  one  point  per  year  “for  every  year  taught  in  California, 
whether  in  Hollister  or  not,  but  only  for  public  school  service.”  (Emphasis  added.)  Thus, 
the  February  7  memorandum  granted  tie  breaker  points  for  service  in  the  district,  whereas 
criterion  6  spoke  only  of  service  “outside  the  District.”  Respondents  did  not  object  to  this 
apparent  discrepancy  and  the  evidence  did  not  show  that  any  respondent’s  layoff  status  was 
affected. 

It  was  not  shown  that  any  respondent’s  layoff  status  was  affected  by  the  “core” 

versus  “departmentalized”  concerns  raised  by  respondents. 

The  accusations  against  Summer  Chamblin,  Marilyn  Cline,  Kimberly  Gaither, 

Alec  Griffin,  Matthew  Hudson,  Kenneth  Johnson,  Morgan  Marquez,  Virginia  Pender,  and 
Timothy  Peters  have  been  withdrawn  and  shall  be  dismissed.  They  are  no  longer 
respondents  in  this  proceeding. 

Lisa  Jelinick  shall  receive  two  additional  tie  breaker  points. 

Lisa  Sinclair  shall  receive  an  additional  tie  breaker  point. 

Olympia  Soto’s  date  of  first  paid  service  in  the  district  shall  be  adjusted  to 

September  7,  2004. 

10. 

All  contentions  made  by  respondents  not  specifically  addressed  above  are 

found  to  be  without  merit  and  are  rejected.
