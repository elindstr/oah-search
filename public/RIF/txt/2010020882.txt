//

// 

3. 

On February 18, 2010, the Governing Board (Board) of the District adopted a 
resolution to reduce and discontinue, at the end of the 2009-2010 school year, the following 
particular kinds of services provided by the District (PKS Resolution): 

Service 

FTE Reduction

Elimination of class size reduction in grades K-3 

Elimination of class size reduction in 9th grade English 

Intensive Learning Center Specialists 

Total 

80.0

4.0

4.0

88.0

 

 
4. 

 
The PKS Resolution further authorized and directed the Superintendent or his 
or her designee “to initiate and pursue procedures necessary to not reemploy the equivalent 
of eighty-eight (88) full-time certificated positions because of the reduction or 
discontinuance of services.” 

5. 

The PKS Resolution further provided that “[i]n accordance with Education 

Code Section 44955(c) the Governing Board shall make assignments and reassignments in 
such a manner that employees shall be retained to render any service which their seniority 
and qualifications entitle them to render.” 

6. 

On February 18, 2010, the Board adopted a resolution, entitled “Order of 

Termination for Certificated Personnel” (Tie-breaker Resolution), establishing tie-breaker 
criteria for determining the relative seniority of certificated employees who first rendered 
paid service on the same date.  It provided that the order of termination shall be based on the 
needs of the District and its students in accordance with the type and subject matter of 
credentials, college degrees and credits, and teaching experience. 

7. 

On or before March 15, 2010, the District gave notice to each Respondent of 

the potential elimination of his or her position for the 2010-2011 school year.  On March 25, 
2010, the District served the Accusation by certified mail on each Respondent who requested 
a hearing.  

8. 

All Respondents served with the Accusation timely filed requests for hearing 
and notices of defense to determine whether there was cause for not reemploying them for 
the 2010-2011 school year.   

9. 

The Board considered all known attrition, resignations, retirements, and 
requests for transfer in determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices to be 
delivered to its employees. 

 

2

10. 

The District maintains a seniority list that contains employees’ seniority dates, 

titles, credentials, current assignments, and classifications, as well as information related to 
skipping, bumping, and recall rights. 

11. 

The District used the seniority list to develop a proposed layoff list. The 

District considered each teacher’s credentials and certifications.  The District determined that 
no teacher less senior than Respondents was being retained to render services that 
Respondents are certificated and competent to render.  

12. 

The District used information from its seniority list to apply the tie-breaker 

criteria of the Board’s Tie-breaker Resolution. 

13. 

The District skipped and retained all special education teachers.  The District 

retained all temporary teachers in categorically funded programs.  Respondents raised no 
issue as to these matters.   

14. 

The District assigned and reassigned teachers with appropriate credentialing to 

fill positions held by lower seniority teachers or to fill positions vacated by more senior 
teachers who had been reassigned and for which no more senior teachers with appropriate 
credentialing were available. 

15.  At the hearing, the District rescinded the layoff notices and dismissed the 
Accusations against Respondents Michael Magnera, who was reinstated, and Laurel Molina, 
who was non-reelected as a probationary employee. 

16.  At the hearing, the seniority list was amended by stipulation of the parties, as 

follows: 

a. 

The recall number of Catherine Gredsund, who has a seniority date of 

August 29, 2008, was amended from “6” to “5.”  

b. 

The recall number of Lauren Allen, who has a seniority date of August 

29, 2008, was amended from “5” to “6.” 

c. 

Lorena Cornejo’s seniority date was amended from February 1, 2005, 

to September 3, 2004. 

d. 
August 27, 2003. 

Kevin Gaffney’s seniority date was amended from October 4, 2004, to 

e. 

The recall number of Teresa Driscoll, who has a seniority date of 

September 3, 2004, was amended from “22” to “20.” 

f. 

The recall number of Kevin Franco, who has a seniority date of 

September 3, 2004, was amended from “20” to “22.” 

 

3

These changes to the seniority list do not affect Respondents’ employment status with the 
District. 

17. 

Three positions remain unfilled.  A math position, appearing on the seniority 
list with a seniority date of August 29, 2008, remains open because no Respondent has the 
credentials to fill that position.  An art position, appearing on the seniority list with a 
seniority date of September 3, 2004, is open because of a recent resignation and because no 
Respondent has the credentials to fill the position.  A position appearing on the seniority list 
with a seniority date of September 7, 1976 is open due to a recent retirement announcement 
and because no Respondent has the credentials to fill the position.  Respondents raised no 
issue as to these unfilled positions. 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

All notice and jurisdictional requirements set forth in Education Code sections 

44949 and 44955 were met.1 

2. 

Cause exists to sustain BUSD’s action to reduce or discontinue 88.0 full-time-
equivalent positions, as set forth in BUSD’s PKS Resolution for the 2010-2011 school year, 
under sections 44949 and 44955, as set forth in Factual Findings 1-16, and Legal 
Conclusions 1 and 3-9. 

3. 

The services identified in the PKS Resolution are particular kinds of services 

that may be reduced or discontinued under section 44955.  The Board’s decision to reduce or 
discontinue the identified services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and was a proper 
exercise of its discretion.  Cause for the reduction or discontinuation of services relates solely 
to the welfare of the District’s schools and students within the meaning of section 44949. 

4. 

A school district may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955, 
subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not, 
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that 
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to 
deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 
178-179.) 

5. 

Section 44955, subdivision (b), provides, in pertinent part: 

[W]henever a particular kind of service is to be reduced or 
discontinued not later than the beginning of the following school 
year . . . , and when in the opinion of the governing board of the 
district it shall have become necessary by reason of any of these 
conditions to decrease the number of permanent employees in 
the district, the governing board may terminate the services of 

                                                 

1 All further statutory references are to the Education Code. 

 

4

not more than a corresponding percentage of the certificated 
employees of the district, permanent as well as probationary, at 
the close of the school year. 

6. 

Section 44955, subdivision (c), provides, in pertinent part: 

[S]ervices of such employees shall be terminated in the inverse 
of the order in which they were employed . . . . 

The governing board shall make assignments and reassignments 
in such a manner that employees shall be retained to render any 
service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to 
render. 

7. 

The District identified certificated employees providing the particular kinds of 

services that the Board directed be reduced or discontinued.  The District considered 
seniority and qualifications, as set forth in Factual Findings 10 and 11, and properly made 
assignments and reassignments in its discretion in accordance with section 44955, 
subdivision (c).  (See, e.g., Brough v. Governing Bd. of the El Segundo Unified School Dist. 
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 702, 716-717.) 

8. 

No junior certificated employee is scheduled to be retained to perform services 

that a more senior employee is certificated and competent to render. 

ORDER 

The Accusation served on those Respondents identified as providing the particular 

kinds of services that the Governing Board directed to be reduced or discontinued, 
amounting to 88.0 full-time-equivalent positions, is sustained. 

The District shall give notice to Respondents, as required by law, that their services 

will be terminated at the close of the 2009-2010 school year, except as noted below.  The 
District shall give the notice in inverse order of seniority. 

The Accusations as to Michael Magnera and Laurel Molina are dismissed.
