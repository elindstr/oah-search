BEFORE  THE 
GOVERNING  BOARD  OF  THE 
DAVIS  JOINT  UNIFIED  SCHOOL  DISTRICT 
STATE  OF  CALIFORNIA 

In  The  Matter  of  the  Reduction  In  Force  of: 

OAH  No.  2008030022 

CERTAIN  CERTIFICATED  PERSONNEL 
EMPLOYED  BY  THE  DAVIS  JOINT 
UNIFIED  SCHOOL  DISTRICT, 

      

Respondents. 

PROPOSED  DECISION 

This  matter  was  heard  before  Administrative  Law  Judge  Jonathan  Lew,  State  of 
California,  Office  of  Administrative  Hearings,  on  May  2,  5  and  6,  2008,  in  Davis,  California. 

Terry  Filliman,  Attorney  at  Law,  appeared  on  behalf  of  the  Davis  Joint  Unified 

School  District. 

Emest  H.  Tuttle,  IV,  Attorney  at  Law,  appeared  on  behalf  of  all  but  four  respondents. 
Respondents  Kelly  Carlson,  Rebecca  Hurtt,  Sharon  McCorkell  and  Kaitlin  Post  appeared  on 
their  own  behalf. 

Evidence  was  received  and  submission  of  the  matter  was  deferred  pending  receipt  of 
additional  written  argument.  The  District  and  respondents  filed  post-hearing  briefs  on  May 
9,  2008.'  The  case  was  thereafter  submitted  for  decision” 

'  The  District  filed  a  Post-Hearing  Brief,  Final  2008  Certificated  Layoff  Bump  Chart  (Exhibit  10),  Revised  Exhibit 
11  (Exhibit  48  for  identification),  narrative  of  individual  issues  (Exhibit  49  for  identification),  and  Additional  Tie 
Breakers  After  Hearing  (Exhibit  50  for  identification).  Respondents  filed  a  May  9,  2008  letter  argument. 
?  This  matter  was  originally  set  for  hearing  on  April  16  and  17,  2008.  On  March  20,  2008,  an  Order  Granting 
Continuance  was  issued.  Under  Education  Code  section  44949,  subdivision  (e),  if  a  continuance  is  granted  “the 
dates  prescribed  in  subdivision  (c)  which  occur  on  or  after  the  date  of  granting  the  continuance  and  the  date 
prescribed  in  subdivision  (c)  of  Section  44955  which  occurs  after  the  date  of  granting  the  continuance  shall  be 
extended  for  a  period  of  time  equal  to  the  continuance.”  In  this  case,  a  continuance  of  sixteen  (16)  days  was 
granted,  thereby  extending  the  date  that  a  copy  of  the  proposed  decision  is  to  be  submitted  to  the  governing  board 
from  May  7,  to  May  23,  2008;  and  the  time  that  notice  of  termination  of  services  shall  be  given  from  before  May  15, 
to  before  May  31,  2008. 

   

    
  

  

 

  

FACTUAL  FINDINGS  AND  DISCUSSION 

1. 

James  Q.  Hammond  is  the  Superintendent  of  the  Davis  Joint  Unified  School 
District  (District).  Kevin  French  is  the  Assistant  Superintendent,  Human  Resources  of  the 
District.  The  actions  of  Mr.  Hammond  and  Mr.  French,  and  the  actions  of  the  District 
Governing  Board,  were  taken  in  their  official  capacities. 

2. 

Respondents  are  permanent  or  probationary  certificated  employees  of  the 

District.  On  March  11,  2008,  the  District  served  on  each  respondent  a  written  notice  that  it 
had  been  recommended  that  notice  be  given  to  respondents  pursuant  to  Education  Code 
sections  44949  and  44955  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or  would  not  be  required  for 
the  2008-2009  school  year.  Each  written  notice  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation 
and  noted  that  the  District  Governing  Board  had  passed  a  Resolution  reducing  the 
certificated  staff  by  90.95  full-time  equivalent  (FTE)  positions.  Respondents  timely 
requested  in  writing  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the 
ensuing  school  year.  One  employee,  Kaitlin  Post,  later  informed  the  District  that  she  mailed 
in  a  hearing  request,  but  it  was  never  received.  The  District  has  no  objection  to  her 
participation  as  a  party  to  these  proceedings. 

3. 

The  Superintendent  made  and  filed  Accusations  against  respondents.  The 
Accusations  with  required  accompanying  documents  and  blank  Notices  of  Defense  were 
timely  served  on  respondents.  Respondents  timely  filed  Notices  of  Defense  to  the 
Accusation.  Each  respondent  identified  in  ATTACHMENT A to  this  Decision  timely  filed  a 
Notice  of  Defense  to  the  Accusation,  either  in  person  or  through  counsel. 

4. 

On  March  6,  2008,  at  a  regular  meeting,  the  District  Governing  Board  was 

given  notice  of  the  Superintendent’s  recommendations  that  certificated  employees  holding 
90.95  FTE  positions  be  given  notice  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or  not  required  for 
the  next  school  year  and  stating  the  reasons  for  that  recommendation. 

5. 

On  March  6,  2008,  the  District  Governing  Board  determined  that  it  was 

necessary  to  decrease  programs  and  services  and  thus  it  was  necessary  to  reduce  teaching  and 
other  certificated  services  affecting  employment  of  90.95  FTE  positions.  The  District 
Governing  Board  adopted  Resolution  No.  42-08  providing  for  the  reduction  or  elimination  of 
the  following  particular  kinds  of  services  (PKS):

The  District  maintains  17  school  sites  and  has  550  certificated  employees.  It 

has  an  ongoing  deficit  of  $2.5  million,  and  this  will  increase  to  $4.0  million  if  other  proposed 
budget  cuts  are  made.  The  Governing  Board’s  resolution  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular 
kinds  of  services  was  made  in  order  to  reduce  costs  without  reducing  core  subject  areas.  The 
District  issued  115  layoff  notices  prior  to  the  March  15,  2008  deadline,  and  in  response  to 
Resolution  No.  42-08.  The  Board  remains  optimistic  that  as  it  explores  other  options, 

  

  

  

including  monies  raised  within  the  Davis  community,  it  will  be  in  a  position  to  revise 
downward  whatever  level  of  layoff  notices  are  approved. 

e 

7. 

The  District  maintains  a  Certificated  Seniority  List  which  contains  employees’ 

seniority  dates  (first  date  of  paid  service),  status  as  tenured,  probationary  or  temporary,  and 
credentials  and  authorizations.  Status,  credential  and  authorization  data  are  obtained  from 
the  District’s  records  and  employees  are  given  the  opportunity  to  correct  errors  in  the 
seniority  list.  All  certificated  employees  were  provided a  certificated  verification  form  and 
asked  in  writing  to  correct  their  seniority  date  and  any  other  information  contained  in  their 
individual  personnel  information  on  file  with  the  District.  They  were  asked  to  do  so  no  later 
than  February  8,  2008. 

Kevin  French  is  the  District’s  Assistant  Superintendent,  Human  Resources.  He  and 

other  District  employees  were  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  technical  aspects  of  the 
layoff.  The  District  used  the  seniority  list  to  develop  a  proposed  layoff  list  of  the  least  senior 
employees  currently  assigned  in  the  various  services  being  reduced.  The  District  then 
determined  whether  these  employees  held  credentials  in  another  area  and  were  entitled  to  be 
“skipped”  pursuant  to  the  Governing  Board’s  Resolution,  or  could  “bump”  into  positions 
held  by  junior  District  employees. 

Layoff Procedures  Followed  —  General  Skipping  and  Bumping  Issues 

8. 

Board  Resolution  No.  42-08  provides  that  the  District  has  the  need  to  retain 
individual  teachers  in  specific  courses  identified  below  due  to  their  specialized  training  and 
experience  related  to  those  courses,  and  which  more  senior  employees  do  not  possess.  The 
Superintendent  was  authorized  to  deviate  from  terminating  certificated  employees  in  order  of 
seniority  in  instances  where  they  are  currently  assigned  to  teach  specific  courses  and  will  be 
assigned  to  teach  those  courses  again  for  the  next  school  year  and  more  senior  employees  do 
not  possess  the  same  specialized  training  and  experience  related  to  the  course.  The  skipped 
individuals  include  those  who  are: 

e 

a.  Teachers  holding  a  BCLAD  and  teaching  Elementary 
Spanish  Immersion  Classes; 

b.  Instructors  in  the  Elementary  Reading  Program  who  hold 
specialized  reading  certification; 

c.  Employees  in  the  Special  Education  Program 

Others  in  specialized  elementary  teaching  assignments  believe  that  they  should  have  been 
skipped  as  well,  including  those  assigned  to  Montessori  and  Gifted  and  Talented  Education 
(GATE)  instruction  programs. 

  

 

9. 

Montessori  Program.  The  District  has  adopted  a  Montessori  Master  Plan 

(2004-2009)  with  the  intent  that  a  high  quality  Montessori  program  be  provided  in  a  public 
school  setting.  The  Master  Plan  describes  the  program  as  “one  that  allows  children  to  learn 
at  their  own  pace,  according  to  individual  needs.  It  is  a  whole  child  approach,  focusing  on 
the  child’s  cognitive,  social,  emotional,  and  physical  needs.”  Montessori  credentialed 
teachers  go  through  extensive  training  in  the  use  of  learning  apparatus  and  materials  used  in 
this  program. 

Respondents  note  that  historically  it  has  been  very  difficult  to  train  traditional 
classroom  teachers  to  transition  into  the  program  and  to  replace  a  Montessori  credentialed 
teacher.  There  was  high  teacher  turnover  after  the  program  was  started,  when  the  District’s 
practice  had  been  to  allow  teachers  to  be  assigned  to  the  program  and  then  work  toward 
obtaining  their  Montessori  credential.  The  District  recognized  this  problem,  and  has  since 
followed a  policy  of  hiring  only  those  teachers  who  already  hold  Montessori  credentials  into 
the  program.  It  can  take  up  to  three  years  to  obtain  this  credential. 

It  was,  however,  within  the  discretion  of  the  District  Governing  Board  to  determine 
whether  Montessori  credentialed  teachers  should  be  skipped  and  its  refusal  to  do  so  was  not 
an  abuse  of  such  discretion. 

10. 

The  District  proposes  to  allow  Montessori  teachers  to  be  bumped  by  more 

senior  elementary  school  teachers  who  do  not  currently  possess  a  special  certificate 
documenting  training  in  the  Montessori  Method.  The  District’s  rationale  is  that  the 
Montessori  certification  is  not  a  credential,  supplementary  authorization  or  certificate  issued 
by  the  California  Teacher  Credentials  Commission.  The  District  also  relies  upon  the 
Montessori  Master  Plan  which  specifically  provides  that  the  District  may  hire  a  Montessori 
teacher  who  “is  willing,  able,  and  committed  to  be  trained  in  the  Montessori  Method  and  to 
implement  it  faithfully  with  the  DJUSD  model.”  Notwithstanding  the  difficulties  such  policy 
created  when  the  program  was  started,  it  is  the  District’s  official  policy  and  it  is  within  the 
discretion  of  the  District  to  follow  it  at  this  time.  The  District  intends  to  address  Montessori 
program  needs  by  requiring  bumping  teachers  to  sign  a  document  that  they  will  immediately 
undertake  the  requisite  training. 

11. 

GATE  Program.  District  teachers  who  teach  in  self-contained  GATE 

classrooms  must  have  demonstrated  their  experience  and  commitment  to  ongoing  education 
and  training  about  the  cognitive,  social,  and  emotional  needs  of  gifted  students,  and  only 
teachers  who  have  demonstrated  this  commitment  are  placed  and  continued  in  the  GATE 
program.  Respondent  Luisa  Guenther  and  others  in  the  District’s  GATE  program  believe 
that  if  there  are  skips  in  place  for  magnet  positions  such  as  Spanish  Immersion,  then  all 
special  programs  should  be  skipped,  especially  a  federal  program  such  as  GATE.  The 
District  proposes  to  lay  off  GATE  teachers  in  seniority  order  as  elementary  teachers,  and  to 
allow  bumping  by  more  senior  elementary  teachers  who  are  not  in  the  GATE  program. 

  

 

  

As  a  general  proposition,  respondents  believe  that  the  District’s  layoff  process  should 
be  simplified  and  go  strictly  along  lines  of  seniority  so  that  all  its  programs  could  be  reduced 
equally,  rather  than  choosing  one  program  over  another.  Again,  responsibility  for 
determining  which  teachers  should  be  skipped  was  with  the  District’s  Governing  Board,  and 
there  was  no  evidence  that  it  abused  its  discretion  when  it  determined  not  to  skip  teachers  in 
GATE,  Montessori  or  other  important  and  popular  District  programs. 

12. 

Alternative  Education  Bumping  Criteria.  The  district  operates  two  Alternative 
Education  programs:  1)  Continuation  High  School  (King  High  School),  and  2)  Davis  School 
for  Independent  Study  (DSIS).  Both  provide  secondary  level  instruction.  Many  teachers  in 
these  programs  teach  one  or  more  academic  subjects  and  have  been  certified  as  “highly 
qualified”  under  No  Child  Left  Behind  (NCLB)  in  the  academic  subjects  being  taught. 
While  under  the  Education  Code  a  teacher  with  any  credential  may  consent  to  teach  any 
subject  in  alternative  education,  this  does  not  compel  the  District  to  assign  a  teacher  who  is 
not  competent  (i.e.  not  NCLB  certified)  or  otherwise  not  qualified  to  provide  alternative 
education  instruction.  And  the  Board  resolution  prohibits  more  senior  teachers  from 
bumping  into  alternative  education  assignments  unless  they  meet  the  highly  qualified 
standard.? 

13. 

|  Bumping  Into  Elementary  Classrooms.  The  District  has  a  relatively  large 

number  of  part-time  certificated  employees.  They  have  seniority  the  same  as  full-time 
teachers,  and  may  bump a less  senior  full-time  teacher,  but  only  up  to  the  part-time  FTE  they 
hold.  Thus,  a  less  senior  employee  may  be  bumped  by  two  or  more  senior  employees,  rather 
than  by  a  single  employee.  However,  the  District  has  not  allowed  a  part-time  employee  to 
bump  into  an  elementary  teaching  assignment  that  is  full  time.  The  District  believes  such 
bumping  would  be  disruptive  to  self-contained  classroom  instruction  and  not  in  the  interest 
of  students.  Mr.  French  explained  that  students  would  suffer  when  teachers  differ  over 
classroom  management  and  have  conflicting  approaches  to  classroom  instruction.  However, 
when  two  teachers  agree,  they  may  voluntarily  job  share  and  teach  an  elementary  class  in 
tandem. 

14. 

Bumping  Spanish  Immersion  Teachers.  There  was  a  degree  of  confusion  over 

Spanish  Immersion  teachers  holding  a  BCLAD  who  received  layoff  notices.  They  were 
initially  skipped  per  the  Board  Resolution.  However,  they  could  be  bumped  by  more  senior 
elementary  school  teachers  in  the  District  who  also  held  a  BCLAD.  The  District  explained 
that  these  skipping  and  bumping  applications  were  grounded  in  different  District  interests, 
and  were  not  in  conflict.  If  the  skipping  had  not  first  been  applied,  several  more  Spanish 

5  The  Board  Resolution  initially  stated  that  “due  to  the  specific  need  of  the  District  to  hire  and  retain  only  highly 
qualified  teachers  in  academic  subject  areas,  ‘competency’  shall  require  (highly  qualified)  current  confirmation  of 
qualification  of  academic  subject  competency,  or  verifiable  eligibility  for  competency  if  not  previously  reviewed  by 
the  District,  in  all  subjects  of  a  proposed  assignment,  including  assignments  teaching  multiple  academic  subjects  and 
assignments  in  secondary  alternative  schools,  in  accordance  with  NCLB.”  (Board  Resolution  42-08,  paragraph  4.) 
On  May  5,  2008,  the  Governing  Board  amended  the  above  language  to  omit  any  reference  to  the  requirement  for 
highly  qualified  teachers  except  “for  purpose  of  bumping  into  assignments  teaching  multiple  academic  subjects  in 
alternative  schools.”  (Board  Resolution  No.  53-08.) 

 

  

Immersion  teachers  would  have  been  laid  off,  and  more  senior  elementary  teachers  without  a 
BCLAD  would  have  been  retained  who  could  not  teach  in  the  Spanish  Immersion  Program. 
This  application  served  to  ensure  that  a  sufficient  number  of  teachers  were  available  to  be 
assigned  to  this  program,  while  protecting  more  senior  teachers  with  a  BCLAD  from  being 
laid  off.  The  District’s  decision  to  proceed  in  this  fashion  was  not  unreasonable. 

Individual  Skipping/Bumping/Seniority  Issues  -  Elementary 

15. 

Kelly  Carlson.  Respondent  Kelly  Carlson  is  an  elementary  classroom  teacher 

with  a  seniority  date  of  August  27,  2007.  Because  she  is  a  permanent  employee  she  has 
more  “seniority”  than  probationary  employees  who  have  earlier  dates  of  first  hire.  The 
District  has  revised  its  seniority  list  to  accurately  reflect  this.  This  does  not,  however,  change 
her  layoff  status. 

- 

16. 

Kristine  Weir.  Elementary  classroom  teacher  Kristrine  Weir  has  a  District 

seniority  date  of  August  25,  2006.  She  was  classified  as  temporary  during  school  years 
2002-03,  2003-04,  2004-05  and  2005-06  while  working  in  a  .5  FTE  job  sharing  arrangement. 
Her  job  share  partner,  Karen  Johns,  was  on  a  .5  FTE  leave  of  absence  each  of  those  school 
years.  Ms.  Weir  was  given  a  temporary  contract  each  year,  and  released  each  year  as  a 
temporary  employee.  Ms.  Weir  disputed  her  status,  and  was  told  in  August  2003  that  the 
District  was  reviewing  the  issue. 

In  August  2006,  Ms.  Weir  went  to  work  full  time,  but  was  classified  as  a  temporary 
employee  for  school  year  2006-07.  On  April  6,  2007,  the  Governing  Board  reclassified  her 
as  probationary,  retroactive  to  August  25,  2006.  The  District  “tacked”  the  seniority  date 
back  one  year  for  temporary  service  only  for  certificated  employees  who  had  worked  75 
percent  of  the  days  of  the  prior  school  year.  (Ed.  Code,  §§  44918,  44920.)  She  did  not 
receive  credit  for  the  2005-06  school  year  because  the  District  contends  that  she  did  not  work 
75  percent  of  the  days  of  the  year  that  she  was  working  part  time.  A  letter  dated  April  6, 
2007,  from  Interim  Assistant  Superintendent  David  Tooker  advised  Ms.  Weir  at  that  time 
that  “Unfortunately,  because  a  full  year  of  service  is  defined  as  working  at  least  75%  of  the 
number  of  days  in  a  school  year,  your  service  in  a  50%  assignment  during  the  previous 
school  years  cannot  be  considered  toward  probationary  service.”  Ms.  Weir  did  not  contest 
this  determination  then  and  she  did  not  dispute  her  seniority  date  when  given  the  opportunity 
to  do  so  earlier  this  year.  (See  Finding  7.)  Although  Ms.  Weir  believes  she  worked  at  least 
75  percent  of  the  school  days  in  2006-06,  she  has  not  made  the  requisite  showing  that  this 
was  the  case.  Her  District  seniority  date  should  not  be  changed  at  this  time. 

    

William  Daugherty.  Elementary  classroom  teacher  William  Daugherty  was 
first  employed  by  the  District  on  August  26,  2002,  as  a  temporary  employee,  and  continued 
four  years  with  the  District  on  temporary  contracts.  During  the  2005-06  school  year,  the 
Governing  Board  converted  his  status  from  temporary  to  probationary.  The  change  was 
effective  the  start  of  that  school  year,  and  an  additional  year  was  tacked  on  making  his 
seniority  date  September  17,  2004.  The  District  concedes  that  it  is  now  unable  to  validate 
that  Mr.  Daugherty  was  appropriately  authorized  as  a  temporary  employee  for  school  year 

17. 

 

  

2004-05.  Because  it  is  possible  that  his  probationary  service  began  in  September  2004,  it  is 
willing  to  tack  on  his  service  during  school  year  2003-04,  resulting  in  a  new  seniority  date  of 
August  25,  2003. 

Based  upon  his  new  seniority  date,  and  his  multiple  subject  credential,  Mr.  Daugherty 

might  have  been  able  to  bump  Diana  Zaragoza  from  her  position.  District  tie  break  criteria 
were  recently  applied  and  Ms.  Zaragoza  was  determined  to  be  more  senior.  Accordingly, 
Mr.  Daugherty  is  unable  to  bump a junior  employee  and  his  status  of  1.0  FTE  layoff  is 
unchanged. 

18. 

Constance  Alexich.  Elementary  classroom  teacher  Constance  Alexich  was 

hired  on  November  11,  2003,  on  a  1.0  FTE  temporary  contract.  She  was  replacing  a 
temporary  teacher  who  had  passed  away.  Ms.  Alexich  continued  to  work  under  temporary 
contract  for  school  years  2004-05,  and  2005-06,  replacing  two  .5  FTE  teachers  on  leave.  On 
May  18,  2006,  the  Governing  Board  reclassified  her  to  probationary  status,  retroactive  to 
August  25,  2005.  The  District  acknowledged  at  hearing  that  because  she  had  worked  1.0 
FTE  temporary  for  school  year  2004-05,  her  seniority  date  should  be  changed  to  August  23, 
2004. 

Ms.  Alexich  received a  letter  from  the  District  dated  July  10,  2006,  stating  that  her 
reclassification  to  probationary  status  would  be  “effective  your  first  date  of  paid  contracted 
service  with  the  District,  11/21/2003.”  She  now  claims  this  (November  21,  2003)  should  be 
her  District  seniority  date.  On  February  1,  2007,  the  District  sent  a  second  letter  to  Ms. 
Alexich  indicating  that  her  conversion  to  probationary  status  was  effective  the  start  of  the 
2005-06  school  year.  This  would  have  put  her  on  notice  that  the  earlier  letter  was  in  error. 
The  same  can  be  said  of  the  February  2008  request  for  verification  of  her  District  seniority 
date.  Current  District  documents  now  reflect  that  her  seniority  date  has  been  correctly 
changed  to  August  23,  2004. 

The  change  in  seniority  date  to  August  23,  2004,  does  not  impact  Ms.  Alexich’s 

layoff  status  because  elementary  classroom  teachers  with  seniority  back  to  2003  were  also 
noticed. 

19. 

Paula  Bradley.  Elementary  science  prep  teacher  Paula  Bradley  was  noticed  to 

be  laid  off  the  .888  FTE  science  prep  classes  she  now  teaches.  She  teaches  six  classes  at 
Pioneer  Elementary  School.  The  calculation  of  time  spent  teaching  science  prep  has  been 
inconsistent  around  the  District.  This  has  resulted  in  similarly  situated  teachers  being 
credited  with  1.0  FTE  for  doing  the  same  work  (i.e.,  six  classes)  as  Ms.  Bradley.  The 
District  entered  into  a  settlement  at  hearing  whereby  it  has  rescinded  the  layoff  notice  to  Ms. 
Bradley,  and  she  has  withdrawn  her  request  for  a  hearing.  Ms.  Bradley  has  been  converted 
to  1.0  FTE  for  employment  purposes  and  will  be  assigned  to  an  elementary  classroom. 

20. 

Kathleen  Gill.  Elementary  science  prep  teacher  Kathleen  Gill  was  noticed  to 

be  laid  off.851  FTE.  As  in  the  case  of  Ms.  Bradley,  the  District  entered  into  a  settlement 
whereby  it  has  rescinded  the  layoff  notice  to  Ms.  Gill,  and  she  has  withdrawn  her  request  for 

 

  

a  hearing.  Ms.  Gill  has  been  converted  to  1.0  FTE  for  employment  purposes  and  guaranteed 
an  elementary  classroom  teaching  position. 

21. 

Seana  Burke.  High  school  art  teacher  Seana  Burke  holds  a  single  subject  art 

credential.  This  bumping  chain  originates  with  elementary  science  prep  teacher  William 
Storm  being  laid  off  1.0  FTE.  Mr.  Storm  holds a  single  subject  biological  sciences  credential 
and  can  bump  into  the  .8  FTE  position  held  by  secondary  science  teacher  Ken  McKim.’  Mr. 
McKim  holds  several  credentials  including  one  for  Introductory  Art/Drawing/Painting.  The 
District  recommends  that  Mr.  McKim  bump  into  .8  FTE  high  school  art  classes  currently 
taught  by  Seana  Burke.  Ms.  Burke  teaches  .2  FTE  Painting  and  .8  FTE  Photography, 
although  she  is  currently  on  leave  .4  FTE,  and  is  therefore  .6  FTE  for  this  semester.  Mr. 
McKim’s  credentials  allow  him  to  teach  up  to  grade  12  in  drawing  and  painting,  art  history 
or  appreciation,  and  crafts.  He  cannot  provide  classroom  instruction  in  the  more  technical 
mediums  and  specialized  photography  taught  by  Ms.  Burke. 

The  District  notes  that  other  teachers  in  the  high  school  Art  Department  are 
credentialed  to  teach  Photography.  These  include  Gerald  DeCamp,  Christine  Rowland  and 
Douglas  Wright.  They  each  hold  single  subject  art  credentials  and  may  split  assignments 
between  the  two  high  schools,  allowing  Mr.  McKim  to  teach  introductory  art  course  while 
the  other  art  instructors  teach  the  specific  photography  classes  previously  assigned  to  Ms. 
Burke.  Under  these  circumstances,  Mr.  McKim  can  bump  Ms.  Burke  .8  FTE  as  proposed. 
Ms.  Burke  would  also  be  laid  off  an  additional  .2  FTE  per  item  B.16  of  the  Board  Resolution 
relating  to  secondary  art. 

22. 

Scott  Bell.  This  bumping  chain  originates  with  elementary  science  prep 

teacher  Leslie  Whiteford  being  laid  off  1.0  FTE.  Ms.  Whiteford  may  bump  into  the 
elementary  classroom  (Montessori)  assigned  to  Carole  Hughes.  Ms.  Hughes  holds 
supplementary  authorizations  for  English  and  Social  Science,  which  allows  her  to  bump  into 
.3  FTE  position  held  by  social  science  teacher  Thomas  Taylor;  and  into  .7  FTE  position  held 
by  social  science  teacher  Scott  Bell.  Mr.  Bell  can  bump  into  .5  FTE  position  held  by 
Alternative  Education  teacher  Rebecca  Hurtt.  Ms.  Hurtt  only  taught  one  subject,  Social 
Science,  in  that  program.  Mr.  Bell  and  Ms.  Hurtt  have  the  same  District  seniority  date 
(August  25,  2006)  but  Mr.  Bell  won  the  tie  break  on  points. 

The  District  also  proposes  that  high  school  English  teacher  Spencer  Elliot  bump  into 

the  remaining  .3  FTE  held  by  Mr.  Bell.  Mr.  Elliott  was  laid  off  1.0  FTE  as  part  of  the 
secondary  English  reductions.  He  holds  a  supplementary  authorization  in  World  History. 
Mr.  Bell’s  current  assignments  are  .4  FTE  World  Civilization  and  .6  FTE 
Government/Economics  classes.  Mr.  Elliott  is  not  credentialed  to  teach  the  .6  FTE 
Government/Economics  classes.  Mr.  Bell  also  believes  that  Mr.  Elliott  cannot  teach  World 
Civilization  because  he  believes  the  course  is  different  than  World  History.  In  fact,  the 
framework  for  course  content  and  standards  for  state  student  testing  of  content  for  both 

4  Mr.  Storm  can  also  bump  into  the  .2  FTE  secondary  science  position  held  by  Cliff  Dimond,  who  in  turn  may  bump 
into  .2  FTE  held  by  Caitlin  Butler, 

 

  

  

  

course  are  identical.  Mr.  Elliott  is  therefore  credentialed  to  teach  World  Civilization. 
Because  high  school  courses  cannot  be  divided  by  .3  FTE,  the  District  proposes  that  Mr. 
Elliott  should  bump  .4  FTE,  even  though  there  is  only  .3  FTE  remaining  in  Mr.  Bell’s  current 
assignment.  Mr.  Bell  will  be  moving  to  the  Continuation  High  School  for  the  earlier 
referenced  .5  FTE  alternative  education  position.’ 

As  aresult  of  the  above  bumping  chain,  Mr.  Bell  should  be  laid  off  .5  FTE,  and  may 

bump  Ms.  Hurtt  .5  FTE,  who  is  laid  off.  Mr.  Elliott  may  bump  .4  FTE,  and  is  laid  off  .6 
FTE. 

23. 

Sarah  Fonte  and  Julie  Webb.  Elementary  science  prep  teachers  Sarah  Fonte 
and  Sarita  Cooper  were  both  laid  off  1.0  FTE.  Ms.  Cooper  bumped  into  1.0  FTE  position 
held  by  elementary  classroom  teacher  Julie  Webb.  There  was  then  a  bumping  tie  between 
Sarah  Fonte,  Julie  Webb  and  Teresa  Delgadillo  based  upon  their  District  seniority,  August 
23,  2004.°  Sarah  Fonte  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential  with  Supplementary 
Authorization  (Spanish,  Science)  and  a  BCLAD.  She  may  bump  into  the  1.0  FTE  position 
held  by  Spanish  Immersion  teacher  Elizabeth  Castro.  Ms.  Castro  was  initially  skipped  per 
the  Board  Resolution,  and  then  bumped  by  Ms.  Fonte.  (See  Finding  14.) 

Ms.  Webb  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential  and  BCLAD.  She  may  bump  into  the 
1.0  FTE  position  held  by  Spanish  Immersion  teacher  Eva  Dopico-Serantes.’  Ms.  Dopico- 
Serantes  may  bump  into  .6  FTE  position  held  by  Amber  Foster.  Ms.  Foster  is  laid  off  1.0 
FTE.*  Ms.  Dopico-Serrantes  is  laid  off  .4  FTE,  retaining  .6  FTE. 

Individual  Skipping/Bumping/Seniority  Issues  —  Secondary 

24.  —  Clifford  Dimond.  Secondary  science  teacher  Clifford  Dimond  was  laid  off  1.0 

FTE  as a result  of  the  reduction  of  3.0  FTE  secondary  science  teachers.  He  holds  a  Single 
Subject  Life  Science  credential,  with  Supplementary  Authorization  for  Introductory  General 
Sciences.  The  parties  agree  that  he  will  not  be  laid  off,  and  that  he  will  bump  into  several 
fractional  assignments  as  follows:  .1  FTE  Pam  Eimers;  .2  FTE  Caitlin  Butler;  .4  FTE  Jessica 
Bloom;  and  .2  FTE  Matt  Sonstein.  The  District  concedes  an  additional  .1  FTE  to  allow  Mr. 
Dimond  to  retain  his  full  time  status.  Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  the  District  will 
rescind  the  layoff  notice  and  Mr.  Dimond  will  withdraw  his  request  for  hearing. 

*  Mr.  Bell  also  contended  that  he  should  be  permitted  to  bump  into  partial  positions  held  by  two  less  senior  teachers, 
Caitlin  Butler  (.2  FTE)  and  Jessica  Bloom  (.4  FTE).  Another  more  senior  teacher,  Cliff  Dimond,  was  allowed  to 
bump  into  these  fractional  assignments.  Mr.  Dimond’s  seniority  date  is  August  27,  2001. 
°  Application  of  tie  break  criteria  resulted  in  Sarah  Fonte  (8  points),  Teresa  Delgadillo  (6  points)  and  Julie  Webb  (4 
points). 
”  Eva  Dopico-Serantes  lost  a  May  2,  2008  tie-breaker  for  Spanish  Immersion  teachers. 
*  Amber  Foster  was  laid  off  an  additional  .4  FTE  based  upon  reading  specialist  Teri  Lynn  Murphy  bumping  into  the 
balance  of  Ms.  Foster’s  position. 

 

  

25. 

John  Campbell.  Secondary  physical  education  (PE)  teacher  John  Campbell 

was  laid  off  1.0  FTE  as a result  of  the  reduction  of  4.5  FTE  secondary  PE  teachers.  He  holds 
a  Single  Subject  PE  credential,  and  a  Supplementary  Authorization  in  English  Composition. 
The  parties  agree  that  he  will  be  laid  off  .4  FTE,  and  retained  .6  FTE. 

26. 

Timothy  Fahlen.  Secondary  PE  teacher  Timothy  Fahlen  was  laid  off  .9  FTE. 

He  and  Mr.  Campbell  have  the  same  District  seniority  date,  August  25,  2003.  Mr.  Campbell 
won  the  tie-breaker  on  points.  Mr.  Fahlen  should  be  laid  off  .9  FTE. 

27. 

Krista  Halderman-Bermudez.  Secondary  Spanish  teacher  Krista  Halderman- 

Bermudez  was  noticed  to  be  laid  off  1.0  FTE  per  Board  Resolution  reducing  Secondary 
Spanish  by  2.0  FTE.  Her  District  seniority  date  was  initially  determined  to  be  August  25, 
2006.  She  was  initially  on  a  temporary  assignment  which  ended  during  school  year  2005-06. 
She  was  given  retroactive  credit  for  that  school  year,  and  then  the  previous  school  year  was 
tacked  on  resulting  in  her  District  seniority  date  now  being  changed  to  August  23,  2004. 

The  change  in  seniority  date  moves  Ms.  Halderman-Bermudez  up  in  seniority  among 

other  Secondary  Spanish  teachers.  Another  teacher  who  had  also  been  noticed,  Gabriella 
Jimenez-Tabor,  will  now  be  laid  off  under  the  Board  Resolution  reducing  Secondary 
Spanish.  However,  Ms.  Halderman-Bermudez  will  now  be  bumped  1.0  FTE  by  Mary  Kahn, 
who  holds  a  Spanish  credential  and  a  BCLAD.  Ms.  Khan  was  laid  off  1.0  FTE  as a  result  of 
the  Board  Resolution  reducing  EL  Coordinator  by  1.0  FTE,  and  she  is  senior  to  Ms. 
Halderman-Bermudez. 

28. 

 Carlette  Hartsough.  Secondary  Health  teacher  Carlette  Hartsough  was  laid  off 

.9  FTE  per  Board  Resolution  reducing  Secondary  Health  by  3.0  FTE.  Her  District  seniority 
date  is  January  28,  2003.  She  was  not  clear  why  her  status  was  changed  from  temporary  to 
probationary.  The  District  determined  that  Ms.  Hartsough  had  not  signed  any 
acknowledgement  of  her  temporary  assignment  until  February  4,  2003..  She  was  then 
converted  to  probationary  retroactive  to  her  first  date  of  service. 

29. 

Caroline  Loomis.  Secondary  Math  teacher  Caroline  Loomis  was  laid  off  .4 

FTE  per  Board  Resolution  reducing  Secondary  Math  by  6.0  FTE.  Her  District  seniority  date 
is  August  25,  2006.  Ms.  Loomis  was  hired  on  a  temporary  contract  for  school  years  2204- 
05,  and  2005-06  to  replace  a  teacher  who  was  reassigned  to  a  categorically  funded  program. 
In  school  year  2006-07,  Ms.  Loomis  was  hired  to  replace  a  regular  teacher  on  leave  of 
absence.  In  February  2008,  she  was  converted  to  probationary  status,  retroactive  to  the 
beginning  of  this  school  year.  The  District  tacked  on  an  additional  year  for  temporary 
service  from  August  25,  2006.  The  calculation  of  her  seniority  date  appears  correct. 

30. 

Jennifer  Wolfe.  Secondary  English  teacher  Jennifer  Wolfe  was  bumped  .8 
FTE  by  Secondary  Health  teacher  Carla  Levin  when  her  position  was  reduced  by  .8  FTE. 
The  District  did  not  allow  Ms.  Wolfe  to  use  her  Multiple  Subject  credential  to  bump  into  an

agreed  to  rescind  the  layoff  notice  to  Ms.  Wolfe  and  guarantee  her  a  1.0  FTE  High  School 
English  position.

Bumping  Alternative  Education  Teachers  with  Multiple  Academic  Subjects. 

As  noted  in  Finding  11,  alternative  education  teachers  may  teach  one  or  more  academic 
subjects  and  are  required  to  be  certified  as  “highly  qualified”  under  NCLB  in  the  academic 
subjects  being  taught.  The  Board  resolution  prohibits  more  senior  teachers  from  bumping 
into  alternative  education  assignments  unless  they  meet  the  highly  qualified  standard.  Thus, 
the  District  has  not  allowed  bumping  into  Independent  Study  and  Continuation  High  School 
classes  where  the  teacher  was  assigned  to  teach  multiple  academic  subjects  unless  the 
bumping  teacher  was  credentialed  and  NCLB  certified  as  highly  qualified  in  all  subjects 
taught. 

Four  teachers  with  a  single  subject  Math  credential  wish  to  bump  into  the  math 

Individual  Skipping/Bumping/Seniority  Issues  —  Other  District  Services 

portions  of  less  senior  alternative  education  teachers  with  multiple  subject  assignments. '° 
The  testimony  of  Marsha  Ludwig  relating  to  the  DSIS  program,  of  Sharon  McCorkle  relating 
to  the  King  Continuation  High  School  program,  and  of  District  Assistant  Superintendent  Mr. 
French  on  this  point  were  considered.  It  does  appear  that  these  alternative  education 
programs  as  presently  structured  do  not  allow  for  positions  to  be  split  into  single  subjects 
such  as  mathematics.  The  programs  require  a  single  teacher  to  be  able  to  provide  instruction 
across  all  areas  and  levels  of  a  curricula  such  as  life  sciences  or  mathematics.  Ms. 
McCorkle,  for  example,  has  qualifications  to  teach  science,  mathematics  and  music.  The 
alternative  education  programs  also  differ  in  operation  times,  class  length  and  location 
making  it  impractical  for  comprehensive  school.  teachers  to  bump  one  class  in  alternative 
education.  Finally,  because  the  four  teachers  with  a  single  subject  Math  credential  are  not 
“highly  qualified”  in  all  the  subjects  they  would  be  required  to  teach,  they  are  not  certificated 
and  competent  to  bump  junior  employees  currently  assigned  to  alternative  education 
programs. 

   

Training  Specialist  position  was  eliminated.  Alix  Peshette  was  in  the  position,  and  is 
certificated  and  competent  to  bump  into  the  position  held  by  Social  Science  teacher  Ian 
Stevenson.  Mr.  Stevenson  holds  a  single  subject  Social  Science  credential,  and  a 
supplementary  authorization  for  Introductory  English.  Mr.  Stevenson  believes  his  relative 
seniority  allows  him  to  bump  into  .4  FTE  held  by  Jessica  Bloom,  and  .2  FTE  held  by  Caitlin 
Butler.  A  more  senior  teacher,  Clifford  Dimond,  will  bump  into  these  two  positions.  Mr. 
Stevenson  may  be  laid  off  1.0  FTE. 

'°  The  four  teachers  are  Nicholas  Pasquale,  Patricia  Marlow,  Tim  McCormick  and  Caroline  Loomis.  They  propose 
to  bump  less  senior  teachers  Christine  Easton,  Laura  Juanitas  and  Catherine  Scarr.

Christina  Weber-Johnson.  The  Governing  Board  reduced  Elementary 

Librarian  services  by  4.05  FTE.  Christina  Weber-Johnson  is  a  .5  FTE  certificated  librarian 
who  is  noticed  to  be  laid  off.  She  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential,  Library  Media  Teacher 
Services  and  Specialist  LH.  As  a  part  time  employee  she  cannot  partially  bump  into  an 
elementary  classroom  assignment.  Her  credentials  do  allow  her  to  be  assigned  to  a  vacant 
special  education  LH  (mild  to  moderate)  position  at  Cesar  Chavez  School  if  she  so  chooses. 
She  would  need  to  resign  her  .5  FTE  classified  position  to  do  so. 

34. 

Nora  Brazil.  Nora  Brazil  is  a  1.0  FTE  elementary  librarian.  Her  District 

seniority  date  is  August  23,  2004.  The  District  assumed  that  because  she  was  in  a  50  percent 
assignment  she  would  not  have  worked  75  percent  of  the  days  of  school  year  2003-04.  Ms. 
Brazil  testified  that  to  the  best  of  her  recollection  she  worked  four  to  five  days  per  week  that 
school  year.  She  did  not  work  Mondays.  Accordingly,  an  additional  year  should  be  tacked 
on  so  that  Ms.  Brazil’s  District  seniority  date  is  August  25,  2003. 

Ms.  Brazil’s  new  seniority  date  does  not  change  her  layoff  status.  Elementary 

librarians  with  seniority  to  1987  are  being  laid  off.  Ms.  Brazil  was  tied  in  seniority  with 
Diana  Zaragoza  for  bumping  into  an  Elementary  teaching  position  using  her  multiple  subject 
credential.  After  applying  tie-breaker  criteria,  Ms.  Zaragoza  is  more  senior,  and  Ms.  Brazil 
is  still  laid  off  1.0  FTE. 

35. 

Monica  Lillya.  Monica  Lillya  was  proposed  for  layoff  as  a  .5  FTE  Reading 

Specialist.  She  had  a  District  seniority  date  of  August  25,  2005.  This  was  changed  to 
August  25,  2004,  by  converting  a  year  of  temporary  to  probationary  service.  Initially,  the 
District  did  not  tack  an  additional  year  of  temporary  service  because  she  was  a  .5  FTE 
employee  and  the  District  had  no  evidence  that  she  worked  75  percent  of  the  days  in  school 
year  2003-04.  At  hearing,  Ms.  Lillya  testified  that  she  worked  four  days  per  week  over  this 
school  year.  The  District  accepts  this  and  has  changed  her  seniority  date  again  to  August  25, 
2003. 

Ms.  Lillya  and  Amy  Evans-Teaford  are  now  tied  in  seniority  for  layoff.  Both  are 

Reading  Specialists.  Ms.  Evans-Teaford  won  the  tie  break  by  lottery  after  the  two  tied  for 
points.  Because  Ms.  Lillya  is  .5  FTE,  and  the  reduction  is  for  .6  FTE  Reading  Specialist,  Ms. 
Evans-Teaford  is  also  laid  off  .1  FTE. 

36. 

With  due  consideration  and  adjustments  made  for  the  matters  noted  above,  no 
permanent  or  probationary  certificated  employees  junior  to  respondents  are  being  retained  to 
perform  a  service  which  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  render.  Those 
certificated  employees  junior  to  respondents  being  retained  will  provide  services  which 
respondents  are  not  certificated  and  competent  to  perform.

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

The  District  employees  receiving  notices  that  their  services  would  not  be 

required  next  year  have  rendered  valuable  services  to  the  District. 

2. 

All  notice  and  jurisdictional  requirements  set  forth  in  Education  Code  sections 

44949  and  44955  were  met.  The  notices  sent  to  respondents  indicated  the  statutory  basis  for 
the  reduction  of  services  and,  therefore,  were  sufficiently  detailed  to  provide  them  due  process. 
(San  Jose  Teachers  Association  v.  Allen  (1983)  144  Cal.App.3d  627;  Santa  Clara  Federation 
of  Teachers  v.  Governing  Board  (1981)  116  Cal.App.3d  831.)  The  description  of  services  to 
be  reduced,  both  in  the  Board  Resolution  and  in  the  notices,  adequately  describe  particular 
kinds  of  services.  (Zalac  v.  Ferndale  USD  (2002)  98  Cal.App.4th  838.  See,  also,  Degener  v. 
Governing  Board  (1977)  67  Cal.App.3d  689.) 

3. 

The  services  identified  in  Board  Resolution  No.  42-08  are  particular  kinds  of 

services  that  could  be  reduced  or  discontinued  under  Education  Code  section  44955.  The 
Governing  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  identified  services  was  neither 
arbitrary  nor  capricious,  and  was  a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion.  Cause  exists  to  reduce 
the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  due  to  the  reduction  and  discontinuation 
of  particular  kinds  of  services.  Cause  for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  services  relates 
solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District’s  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code 
section  44949. 

4, 

A  District  may  reduce  services  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section 
44955,  subdivision  (b),  “either  by  determining  that  a  certain  type  of  service  to  students  shall 
not,  thereafter,  be  performed  at  all  by  anyone,  or  it  may  ‘reduce  services’  by  determining  that 
proffered  services  shall  be  reduced  in  extent  because  fewer  employees  are  made  available  to 
deal  with  the  pupils  involved.”  (Rutherford  v.  Board  of  Trustees  (1976)  64  Cal.App.3d  167, 
178-179.) 

5. 

Education  Code  section  44955  provides  in  pertinent  part:

(b)  Whenever  in  any  school  year  ...  whenever  a  particular  kind 
of  service  is  to  be  reduced  or  discontinued  not  later  than  the 
beginning  of  the  following  school  year,  ...or  whenever  the 
amendment  of  state  law  requires  the  modification  of  curriculum, 
and  when  in  the  opinion  of  the  governing  board  of  the  district  it 
shall  have  become  necessary  by  reason  of  any  of  these 
conditions  to  decrease  the  number  of  permanent  employees  in 
the  district,  the  governing  board  may  terminate  the  services  of 
not  more  than  a  corresponding  percentage  of  the  certificated 
employees  of  the  district,  permanent  as  well  as  probationary,  at 
the  close  of  the  school  year.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  by 

14 

 

  

statute,  the  services  of  no  permanent  employee  may  be 
terminated  under  the  provisions  of  this  section  while  any 
probationary  employee,  or  any  other  employee  with  less 
seniority,  is  retained  to  render  a  service  which  said  permanent 
employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

4.0.4 

6. 

Education  Code  section  44955  provides  that  when  certificated  employees  face 

layoffs  due  to  reduction  or  elimination  of  PKS,  the  District  has  an  affirmative  obligation  to 
reassign  senior  teachers  who  are  losing  their  positions  into  positions  held  by junior  teachers, 
if  the  senior  teacher  has  both  the  credentials  and  competence  to  occupy  such  positions.  The 
intent  of  the  Legislation  is  clearly  to  prevent  Districts  from  laying  off  senior  teachers  while 
retaining  junior  teachers.  Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (c)  provides  in 
pertinent  part: 

Services  of  such  employees  shall  be  terminated  in  the  inverse  of 
the  order  in  which  they  were  employed...  The  governing  board 
shall  make  assignments  and  reassignments  in  such  a  manner  that 
employees  shall  be  retained  to  render  any  service  which  their 
seniority  and  qualifications  entitle  them  to  render... 

7. 

As  set  forth in  Factual  Findings  19,  20,  24,  25  and  30,  the  District  has 

rescinded  notices  of  layoff  to  Paula  Bradley  (.888  FTE),  Kathleen  Gill  (.251  FTE),  Clifford 
Dimond  (.1  FTE),  John  Campbell  (.6  FTE)  and  Jennifer  Wolfe  (.8  FTE).  As  a  result  of  this 
settlement,  the  District  will  reduce  the  total  number  of  particular  kinds  of  certificated 
services  to  be  reduced  or  eliminated  by  2.639  FTE.  The  adjusted  figure  at  the  time  of 
hearing  was  88.31  FTE  (90.95  minus  2.639).  The  District  has  since  adjusted  this  figure 
further  downward  so  that  the  total  number  of  positions  now  being  eliminated  as  a  result  of 
Board  Resolution  42-08  is  85.607  FTE.  (District  Post-Hearing  Brief,  p.  8.)  In  the  final 
analysis,  the  District  is  proposing  the  layoff  off  of  77.896  FTE  certificated  employees. 

8. 

As  set  forth  in  the  Factual  Findings  the  District  has  considered,  provided  a 

reasonable  explanation  for,  or  made  corrections  to  seniority  dates  for  respondents  Kelly 
Carlson  (Finding  15),  Kristine  Weir  (Finding  16),  William  Daugherty  (Finding  17), 
Constance  Alexich  (Finding  18),  Krista  Halderman-Bermudez  (Finding  27),  Carlette 
Hartsough  (Finding  28),  Caroline  Loomis  (Finding  29),  Norma  Brazil  (Finding  34)  and 
Monica  Lillya  (Finding  35). 

9. 

As  set  forth  in  Factual  Findings  8,  9,  10,  11  and  14,  the  District  has  provided 
its  rationale  for  initially  skipping  Elementary  Classroom  Spanish  Immersion  teachers  who 
currently  hold  a  BCLAD,  Elementary  Reading  Specialist  teachers  and  Special  Education. 
There  was  no  evidence  offered  to  rebut  the  Governing  Board’s  authority  or  exercise  of 
discretion  in  doing  so.  There  was  also  no  evidence  that  the  Governing  Board  abused  its 
discretion  in  not  skipping  other  popular  District  programs  (Montessori/GATE). 

15 

  

 

  

10. 

As  set  forth  in  the  Factual  Findings,  the  District  applied  bumping  and  skipping 
rules  with  consistency  and  care,  and  generally  allowed  bumping  based  upon  the  more  senior 
employee  holding  a  credential  or  authorization  to  teach  the  assignment  of  the  less  senior 
teacher.  The  District  articulated  the  rationale  for  its  bumping  rules  (Findings  12  through  14) 
and  properly  applied  them,  along  with  tie  break  criteria,  when  the  process  so  required. 

11. 

Cause  exists  for  the  reduction  of  the  particular  kinds  of  services  and  for  the 
reduction  of  85.607  full-time  equivalent  certificated  positions  at  the  end  of  the  2007-2008 
school  year  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  Therefore,  and  except  as 
otherwise  noted  above,  cause  exists  to  give  respondents  notice  that  their  services  will  be 
reduced  or  will  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  2008-2009  school  year. 

12. 

This  matter  was  originally  set  for  hearing  on  April  16  and  17,  2008.  On 

March  20,  2008,  an  Order  Granting  Continuance  was  issued.  Under  Education  Code  section 
44949,  subdivision  (e),  if  a  continuance  is  granted  “the  dates  prescribed  in  subdivision  (c) 
which  occur  on  or  after  the  date  of  granting  the  continuance  and  the  date  prescribed  in 
subdivision  (c)  of  Section  44955  which  occurs  after  the  date  of  granting  the  continuance  shall 
be  extended  for  a  period  of  time  equal  to  the  continuance.” 

In  this  case,  a  continuance  of  sixteen  (16)  days  was  granted,  thereby  extending  the 

date  that  a  copy  of  the  proposed  decision  is  to  be  submitted  to  the  governing  board  from  May 
7,  to  May  23,  2008;  and  the  time  that  notice  of  termination  of  services  shall  be  given  to 
employees  from  before  May  15,  to  before  May  31,  2008. 

ORDER 

1. 

Cause  exists  for  the  reduction  of  85.607  full-time  equivalent  certificated 

positions  at  the  end  of  the  2007-2008  school  year.  After  making  the  adjustments  set  forth  in 
the  Factual  Findings  and  Legal  Conclusions,  notice  shall  be  given  to  remaining  respondents 
that  their  services  will  be  reduced  or  will  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  school  year,  2008- 
2009,  because  of  the  reduction  and  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of  services. 

2. 

The  time  that  notice  of  termination  of  services  shall  be  given  to  respondents  is 

extended  from  before  May  15,  2008,  to  before  May  31,  2008.
