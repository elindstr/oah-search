Resolution No. 68-09/10 also provided that it may be necessary to retain certificated 

 
 
employees who possess special certifications, service credentials, training or experience, 
which other certificated with more seniority do not possess, to teach a specific course of 
study and these needs may include special education, health educators (nurses), and 
independent study teachers. 
 

The services set forth above are particular kinds of services that may be reduced or 

discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.  None of the reductions 
is for a mandated service. 
 

6. 

The District timely notified respondents by March 15, 2010, that their services 

would be reduced and/or discontinued for the 2010 – 2011 school year, and that they had a 
right to a hearing, pursuant to Education Code section 44955. 
 

7. 

Respondents timely requested a hearing pursuant to Education Code sections 
44949 and 44955 to determine whether there is cause for not reemploying them for the 2010 
– 2011 school year. 
 

8. 

The District timely served respondents with an accusation, pursuant to 

Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, notifying them that their services would be 
reduced and/or discontinued for the 2010 – 2011 school year, and of their right to a hearing.   
 

9. 

The respondents listed in Attachment A timely filed a Notice of Defense and a 

First Amended Notice of Defense.   
 

10. 

The respondents listed in Attachment B each timely filed a Notice of Defense. 

They were unrepresented, did not appear at the hearing, and did not contest the accusations 
issued against them.

11. 

The parties at hearing stipulated that Christina Byers (seniority list #1315) 

became a permanent employee in a 0.6 FTE position effective the beginning of the 2009 – 
2010 school year.  The District notified Byers of the change in her classification on April 20, 
2010. 
 

12. 

The parties at hearing stipulated that Patricia Whalen (seniority list #213) and 

Michelle Reardon-Simpson (seniority list #226) are certificated and competent to serve in 
psychology positions and therefore have rights to bump into psychology positions.  There are 
currently two open psychology positions into which Whalen and Reardon-Simpson may be 
placed.  Whalen and Reardon-Simpson will be employed by the District for the 2010 – 2011 
school year in either psychology or counseling positions. 
 

13. 

 The parties at hearing stipulated that the layoff notice provided to Nancy 

Favreau (seniority list #1297) will be rescinded. 
 

14. 

The parties at hearing stipulated that Vivian Srouji (seniority list #338) is 

certificated and competent to serve in an English position.  There is currently an open 
English position into which Srouji may be placed.  Srouji will be employed by the District 
for the 2010 – 2011 school year in either an English or a counseling position. 
 

15.  Andrea Frederickson (seniority list #1400) is shown on the District’s seniority 
list with a seniority date of August 20, 2008.  In June 2008, Frederickson was a newly hired 
second grade teacher in the District.  Frederickson’s school principal informed her about a 
grade-level meeting for the school’s second grade teachers.  The principal suggested that 
Frederickson ask the second grade teachers for the date of the meeting.  Frederickson did not 
recall whether her principal told her she had to attend the meeting.  On June 30, 2008, 
Frederickson attended the all-day meeting with her fellow second grade teachers.  The 
purpose of the meeting was to prepare for the 2008 – 2009 school year, including by dividing 
up tasks such as yard duty and prep schedules.  Frederickson was paid for the day, but she 
did not recall whether she received payment in a single check or as part of a larger paycheck.  
There was no documentary evidence regarding the form of Frederickson’s pay for her 
attendance at the June 30, 2008 meeting.  That date was outside the contract period for the 
2008 – 2009 school year.    
 

Richard Caldera, Director of Certificated Personnel, testified, and it is found, that a 

teacher’s attendance at a meeting such as Frederickson attended on June 30, 2008, is 
traditionally on a voluntary basis, that attendance is not mandatory, and that the District does 
not consider attendance to be part of the teacher’s paid service, although he acknowledged 
that teachers are sometimes paid “outside the contract” for their attendance.   
 

16. 

For the 2008 – 2009 school year, the collective bargaining agreement between 
the District and its teachers provided for a “floating work day” before the first day of school 
on August 25, 2008.  Under the agreement, teachers were required to select and work one 
day between August 11 and 21, 2008 (excluding the August 16 and 17 weekend).  The 

-4- 

District deemed August 20, 2008, the first day of paid service for that school year no matter 
the date a teacher worked his or her floating work day.  
 

The purpose of the floating work day was to provide teachers flexibility as they 
prepared for the new school year.  The collective bargaining agreement between the District 
and its teachers has provided a floating work day for about seven years.  There was no 
evidence that the District or the teachers’ union intended to have a teacher’s seniority date 
turn on the floating work day selected by a teacher. 
 

17.  Kathryn Murphy (seniority list #1446) and Barbara Weisbrod (seniority list 

#1356) both worked their floating work day on August 12, 2008.  Both appear on the 
District’s seniority list with a seniority date of August 20, 2008. 
 

18.  No permanent or probationary certificated employee with less seniority than a 
respondent is being retained to provide a service for which a respondent is credentialed and 
competent to render.  
 

19. 

The reduction or discontinuation of services is related to the welfare of the 

district and of its pupils. 
 

 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

 Christina Byers (seniority list #1315) became a permanent employee in a 0.6 
FTE (full-time equivalent) position effective the beginning of the 2009 – 2010 school year. 
 

2. 

Patricia Whalen (seniority list #213) and Michelle Reardon-Simpson (seniority 
list #226) are certificated and competent to serve in psychology positions and therefore have 
rights to bump into psychology positions.  The District will employ Whalen and Reardon-
Simpson for the 2010 – 2011 school year in either psychology or counseling positions. 
 

3. 

The layoff notice provided to Nancy Favreau (seniority list #1297) will be 

rescinded.  
 

4. 

Vivian Srouji (seniority list #338) is certificated and competent to serve in an 
English position.  The District will employ Srouji for the 2010 – 2011 school year in either 
an English or a counseling position. 
 

5. 

Andrea Frederickson (seniority list #1400) attended and was paid for a grade-

level teachers’ meeting on June 30, 2008.  It was not established, however, that her 
attendance at the meeting was mandatory or that her seniority date should be other than 
August 20, 2008, as shown on the District’s seniority list. 
 

6. 

The purpose of the floating work day was to provide teachers flexibility as 

they prepared for the new school year, not to have a teacher’s seniority date turn on the 
floating work day selected by a teacher.  To have seniority dates turn on the date of the 

-5- 

floating work day would defeat the intended purpose of the floating work day – flexibility – 
by providing an incentive for teachers to select the earliest floating day possible.   
 

Although Kathryn Murphy (seniority list #1446) and Barbara Weisbrod (seniority list 

#1356) worked their floating work day on August 12, 2008, it was not established that their 
seniority dates should be other than August 20, 2008, as shown on the District’s seniority 
list. 
 

7. 

Because of the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services set forth 
in Factual Finding 5, cause exists pursuant to Education Code section 44955 to give notice to 
respondents that their services will not be required for the 2010 – 2011 school year.  This 
cause solely relates to the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof within the meaning of 
Education Code section 44949. 
 

Except as set forth in Legal Conclusions 2, 3, and 4, notice may be given to 

 
respondents that their services will not be required for the 2010 – 2011 school year.
