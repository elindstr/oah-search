Nancy L. Klein, Attorney at Law, School and College Legal Services of California,

represented the Fortuna Union High School District.

Matthew Malkus, respondent, was present and represented himself.

The matter was submitted for decision on April 20, 2012.

ISSUES

1. Was Notice of release properly made by the District on a certificated

administrator?

2. Does a “clear multiple subject teaching credential” entitle the respondent to remain

employed by the District in a position he is currently credentialed and competent to teach?

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

The parties stipulated that the District has complied with all procedural

requirements of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.

2.

Fortuna Union High School District consists of three high schools: Academy
of the Redwoods (grades 9 though 12); Fortuna High School (grades 9 though 12); and East
High Continuation High School (grades 10 through 12).

3.

On March 8, 2012, the Board of Trustees of the Fortuna Union High School

District adopted Resolution No. 2011-12.05, in which the Board resolved to reduce or
discontinue the following particular kinds of services at the end of the 2012-2013 school
year:

Eliminate the equivalent of 1.0 (F.T.E.)1 Opportunity Class Teacher
Independent Study teacher
Eliminate the equivalent of 1.0 (F.T.E.)
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.4 (F.T.E.)
English Teacher
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.4 (F.T.E.) Mathematics Teacher
Eliminate the equivalent of 1.0 (F.T.E.)

Elementary School Teacher

The resolution directed the District’s Superintendent, or his designee, to initiate
procedures to not reemploy the equivalent of 3.8 F.T.E. certificated employees of the District
pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the 2012-2013 school year.

4.

On March 8, 2012, District Superintendent Glen Senestraro sent notice to four

certificated employees of his recommendation that their services would be reduced or
discontinued for the 2012-2013 school year. Three certificated permanent employees
(respondents Jack Millsap, Brett Roslosnik, and Matthew Malkus) filed a request for hearing
and a notice of defense. Respondents Roslosnik and Millsap withdrew their requests for a
hearing and notices of defense and were not disputing their lay off notices. The fourth
teacher to receive notice, Lacey Sandborn, did not file a request for hearing. In this
proceeding, there is one respondent, Matthew Malkus.

5.

The Board’s decision to reduce 3.8 full-time equivalent positions was based on

a combination of declining enrollment and an anticipated loss of revenue from the State of
California for the 2012-2013 school year.

6.

On March 8, 2012, the Board of Trustees of the Fortuna Union High School

District adopted Resolution No. 2011-12.06, in which the Board adopted a resolution of final
release from certificated administrative assignment for the 2012-2013 school year as set forth
below:

WHEREAS, Education Code section 44951 authorizes
this Board of Trustees to give notice to a certificated employee
serving in a certificated employee serving in a certificated

1 F.T.E. refers to full-time equivalent.

2

administrative position that he/she shall be released from his/her
position for the following school year.

WHEREAS, Matthew Malkus (“Employee”), is a

certificated administrative employee whose position is 1.0
Principal (Academy of the Redwoods) in this District;

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees has received a
recommendation from the District Superintendent not to
reemploy Employee in the same position for he 2012-2013
school year;

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees has discussed the
recommendation made by the Superintendent and concurs in
said recommendation.

7.

On March 9, 2012, Matthew Malkus was personally served with a Notice of

Release from an Administrative Position pursuant to Education Code section 44951,
informing him that he will not be re-employed as a 1.0 F.T.E. certificated administrator
employee for the 2012-2013 school year. Malkus signed and acknowledged receipt of the
notice of release on March 9, 2012.

8.

Matthew Malkus was employed by the District pursuant to a contract for the

2011-2012 school year, commencing on July 1, 2011 and terminating on June 30, 2012.
Malkus has served as a site administrator since 2008 and pursuant to Education Code section
44956.5 has earned three years seniority.

9.

The District, without cause, can decide not to re-employ an administrator in an

administrator’s position at the end of the term of the contract.

10.

During the 2011-2012 school year, Malkus was the on-site administrator

(principal) at the Academy of the Redwoods, in the Fortuna Union High School District.
Malkus’ first date of paid service with the District was July 1, 2008. On the District’s
seniority list his credentials are listed as a “Clear Administrative Services” credential and a
“Clear Multiple Subject” credential. Malkus has no right to bump any other teacher and
consequently, the tie breaking criteria is not applicable.

11. Malkus’ “Clear Multiple Subject” credential, according to the California

Commission of Teacher Credentialing, authorizes him to teach the following classes:

This credential authorized the holder to teach all subjects in a
self-contained class and, as a self-contained classroom teacher,
to team teach or to regroup students across classrooms, in grades
twelve and below, including preschool, and in classes organized
primarily for adults. In addition, this credential authorizes the

3

holder to teach core classes consisting of two or more subject to
the same group of students in grades five through eight, and to
teach any of the core subjects he or she is teaching to a single
group of students in the same grade level as the core for less
than fifty percent of his or her work day.

12. Malkus submitted evidence at hearing that reflects during the 2011-2012

school year, while the principal at the Academy of the Redwoods, Malkus taught
independent study classes to District students. For the 2011-2012 school year at the
Academy of the Redwoods, there are two certificated and competent permanent employees
with more seniority than Malkus, teaching independent study classes. The District’s
resolution eliminates the equivalent of 1.0 F.T.E. Independent Study Teacher for the 2012-
2013 school year.

13.

No certificated employee junior in seniority to Malkus is being retained by the

District to perform services that Malkus is certificated and competent to render with his
multiple subject teaching credential.

14.

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services is related to the

welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to Education Code sections

44949 and 44955, and all notices and other requirements of those sections have been
provided as required by law.

Release of certificated administrator

2.

Administrators are subject to layoff in the same manner as teachers. They

hold their administrative positions at the pleasure of the district and therefore have no
statutory right to maintain them. (Hentschke v. Sink (1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 19.) However,
administrators hired into the district after July 1, 1983, earn no seniority for bumping
purposes unless they are site administrators, in which case they can earn a maximum of three
years’ seniority. (Ed. Code, § 44956.5.)

By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 6 through 9, the District properly issued

notice to Matthew Malkus that he would not be re-employed as a certificated administrator
for the 2012-2013 school year pursuant to Education Code section 44951.

Multiple subject credential

3.

Pursuant to Education Code section 44956.5, as a site administrator at the

Academy of the Redwoods, Matthew Malkus is entitled to three years’ seniority toward a
teaching position he is certificated and competent to teach. However, there are no positions

4

available in the District. Consequently, cause exists because of the reduction of particular
kinds of services pursuant to Education Code section 44955 to give notice to respondent
Mathew Malkus that 1.0 F.T.E. of his services will not be required for the 2012-2013 school
year. The cause relates solely to the welfare of the schools and its pupils within the meaning
of Education Code section 44949.

ORDER

Notice may be given to respondent Matthew Malkus that his service will be not be

needed for the 2012-2013 school year because of the reduction of particular kinds of
services.
