FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1, 

Layoff  notices  were  rescinded  for  thirteen  certificated  employees  whose 

names  appear  on  Exhibit  #  5. 

2. 

Orla  O’Keeffe  made  this  accusation  in  her  official  capacity  as  the  Chief 
Administrative  Officer  of  the  San  Francisco  Unified  School  District  of  San  Francisco 
County,  State  of  California. 

3. 

Each  of  the  Respondents  listed  on  Exhibit  B,  attached  to  the  Accusation  in  this 

matter,  was  at  all  times  and  now,  is  a  certificated  employees  of  the  District. 

4, 

On  February  28,  2006,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  San  Francisco  Unified 

School  District  adopted  the  criteria  for  establishing  the  order  of  termination  among 
respondents  who  have  the  same  date  of  first  rendering  paid  service  to  the  district  and  the

  

order  of  termination  among  respondents.  However,  it  was  not  necessary  to  use  this  tie 
breaking  criteria  for  purposes  of  the  2006/2007  school  year  layoffs. 

5. 

On  February  28,  2006,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  San  Francisco  Unified 

School  District  adopted  resolution  62-28S02,  directing  the  Chief  Administrative  Officer  to 
give  notices  to  certificated  employees  that  their  services  would  not  be  needed  for  the 
2006/2007  school  year. 

6. 

On  March  15,  2006,  the  Chief  Administrative  Officer  gave  written  notice  to 

the  Governing  Board  of  the  Superintendent’s  recommendation  that  notice  be  given  to 
respondents  that  their  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  year,  2006/2007,  and 
stating  the  reasons. 

7. 

On  March  15,  2006,  respondents  were  served  in  the  manner  required  by  law 

with  written  notice  that  it  had  been  recommended  that  notice  be  given  to  them  that  their 
services  would  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  school  year,  2006/2007,  and  stating  the 
reasons. 

8. 

9. 

Each  respondent,  within  the  time  limit  specified  by  law,  requested  a  hearing  to 

determine  if  there  is  cause  for  not  reemploying  the  respondent  for  the  ensuing  school  year. 

The  original  particular  kinds  of  services  were  listed  in  Exhibit  2  and  consisted 

of  a  reduction  of  89.5  Full  Time  Equivalent  (FTE)  positions.  This  reduction  included  50 
FTE  in  administrative  services  and  39.5  in  instructional  services.  This  number  was  reduced 
to  a  total  of  54  FTE  as  reflected  in  Exhibit  4.  This  new  reduction  includes  21.40  FTE  for 
administrative  services  and  32.60  FTE  in  instructional  services.  These  services  are  to  be 
reduced  or  discontinued  no  later  than  the  beginning  of  the  2006/2007  school  year. 

10. 

By  reason  of  the  reduction  and  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of  services, 

cause  exists  under  Education  Code  section  44949  and  44955  for  not  reemploying 
respondents  for  the  2006/2007  school  year. 

11. 

|  No  permanent  or  probationary  certificated  employee  with  less  seniority  is 

being  retained  to  render  a  service  that  respondents,  or  any  of  them,  are  certificated  and 
competent  to  render. 

12. 

The  cause  for  not  reemploying  respondents  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the 

schools  and  the  pupils  of  the  district. 

13. 

One  teacher,  Wendy  Berkelman,  was  called  to  testify  about  her  contracts  of 
employment  for  several  different  school  years.  Her  testimony  does  not  impact  this  layoff 
hearing  in  any  way. 

     

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1, 

Except  as  otherwise  adjusted  by  the  District,  jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists 

under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  All  notices  and  jurisdictional  requirements 
contained  in  those  sections  were  satisfied. 

2. 

Cause  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44944  for  the  San 

Francisco  Unified  School  District  to  reduce  and/or  discontinue  54  FTE  particular  kinds  of 
services  as  set  forth  in  Finding  9,  above.  The  case  for  the  reductions  and  /or  discontinuance 
of  particular  kinds  of  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  pupils  in  the 
district.  A  preponderance  of  the  evidence  sustained  the  matters  set  forth  in  the  Accusation. 
It  is  recommended  that  the  Governing  Board  notice  the  appropriate  employees  before  May 
15,  2006,  that  their  services  are  no  longer  required  by  the  district  for  the  2006/2007  school 
year. 

ORDER 

Notice  shall  be  given  in  reverse  order  of  seniority  based  on  the  54  FTE  particular 
kinds  of  services  to  the  appropriate  employees  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the 
2006/2007  school  year.
