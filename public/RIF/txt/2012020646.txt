General Findings Concerning Statutory Requirements

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Education Code sections 44949 and 44955,3 provide for two notices to be

given in connection with terminating certificated employees. The first notice, which will be
referred to as the Preliminary Layoff Notice, is given by the superintendent. It is given to the
governing board and to the employees the superintendent recommends for layoff. The
Preliminary Layoff Notice gives the board and the employees notice that the superintendent
recommends that those employees be laid off. The superintendent must give the Preliminary
Layoff Notice no later than March 15. There is no requirement that a governing board take
any action in March. But while it is unnecessary, governing boards usually adopt a
resolution ratifying the superintendent’s recommendations.

2.

The second notice is a notice of a governing board’s decision to terminate an
employee. That notice is provided for in Section 44955 and must be given before May 15.
That notice advises a teacher that the district will not require his or her services for the
ensuing school year. That notice will be referred to as a Termination Notice.

3.

In this case, not later than March 15, the superintendent notified the governing

board and the respondents that he recommended that the respondents not be retained for the
ensuing school year.

4.

The Preliminary Layoff Notice stated the reasons for the recommendation.

The recommendation was not related to respondents’ competency.

3 All references to the Code are to the Education Code unless otherwise specified.

2

5.

A Preliminary Layoff Notice was delivered to each respondent, either by

personal delivery or by depositing the notice in the United States mail, registered, postage
prepaid, and addressed to respondent’s last known address.

6.

The Preliminary Layoff Notice advised each respondent as follows: He or she
had a right to a hearing. In order to obtain a hearing, he or she had to deliver a request for a
hearing in writing to the person sending the notice. The request had to be delivered by a
specified date, which was a date that was not less than seven days after the notice was
served.4 And the failure to request a hearing would constitute a waiver of the right to a
hearing.

7.

Respondents either timely filed written requests for a hearing or obtained a

waiver of their failure to file. An accusation was timely served on respondents. Respondents
were given notice that, if they were going to request a hearing, they were required to file a
notice of defense within five days after being served with the accusation.5 Respondents
either filed timely notices of defense or obtained a waiver of their failure to file. All
prehearing jurisdictional requirements were either met or waived.

8.

The governing board of the district resolved to reduce or discontinue particular
kinds of services. Within the meaning of Section 44955, the services are “particular kinds of
services” that can be reduced or discontinued. The decision to reduce or discontinue these
services was not arbitrary or capricious but constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

Services the District Intends to Reduce or Discontinue

9.

The governing board of the district determined that, because particular kinds

of services are to be reduced or discontinued, it is necessary to decrease the number of
permanent or probationary employees in the district.

10.

The particular kinds of services the governing board of the district resolved to

reduce or discontinue are:

4 Employees must be given at least seven days in which to file a request for a hearing.

Education Code section 44949, subdivision (b), provides that the final date for filing a
request for a hearing “shall not be less than seven days after the date on which the notice is
served upon the employee.”

5 Pursuant to Government Section 11506, a party on whom an accusation is served
must file a notice of defense in order to obtain a hearing. Education Code section 44949,
subdivision (c)(1), provides that, in teacher termination cases, the notice of defense must be
filed within five days after service of the accusation.

In addition, the district stipulated that it will rescind a Preliminary Layoff

Use of Tie-Breaking Criteria Based on the Current Needs of the District and Students

13.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (b), the governing board of the district

adopted criteria for determining the order of termination as among employees who first
rendered paid service on the same day. Section 44955, subdivision (b), requires a district to
adopt such criteria and provides that the criteria are to be based on “needs of the district and
the students . . . .”

14.

The district’s tie-breaking criteria are as follows:

For the 2012-2013 school year only, to meet the requirements of
section 44955, the Board of Education determines the needs of
the District and the students by establishing the following tie-
breaking criteria:

The Governing Board has determined that as between

1.
certificated employees who first rendered service in a
probationary position to the District on the same date, the order
of termination of said employees shall be determined by
reference to the tiebreaker criteria and points to be assigned as
follows:

4 points for each valid preliminary credential on file, or 3 points
for intern credential, or2 points for Short Term Staff Permit
(STSP) or Provisional
(PIP) or Limit
Assignment Permit

Internship Permit

Credentials

9

a.
3 points for holding a Bilingual Cross-cultural Language
and Academic Development (BCLAD) Certificate or Bilingual
Certificate of Competence (BCC) on file

b.
2 points for an authorization to teach English Language
Learners on file, or: 1 point for Emergency CLAD / STSP
CLAD / PIP CLAD / Intern CLAD

2 points for subject matter authorizations, or 1 point for
each additional supplemental authorization appearing on
the face of the credential provided that each subject will
be offered in the District’s instructional program in
2012-2013; 1 point for RSP certificate issued by CTC; 1
point for Autism Spectrum Disorder certificate issued by
CTC.

3 points for current National Board Certification on file

1 point for each year of step placement on salary

1 point for serving as a BTSA Support Provider within

h.

2.
Individuals who are specifically exempted by resolution
and individuals who do not receive a notice of layoff due to the
scope of their credential with nevertheless receive point totals so
that their service may be properly credited in the even of a
dispute.

Employees who receive a notice and who share the same

3.
date of first paid service shall be ranked by point totals. Low
point totals will indicate low seniority for that hire date. For
example, an individual with a point total of “1” will be laid off
before an individual with a point total of “3” where both
individuals share the same date, and provided layoff was not
otherwise determined by virtue of credential or exemption.

10

If the above criteria do not break a tie, the District shall

4.
hold a lottery. Each group of tied employees shall have the right
to attend the lottery and pick a lottery number. In the absence of
the employee, the Superintendent or designee will select a
lottery number on behalf of the employee.

These criteria have been determined to best serve the

5.
needs of the District and students thereof.

15.

Application of the tie-breaking criteria resulted in determining the order of

termination solely on the basis of needs of the district and the students thereof.

District’s Intention to Deviate from Seniority (Skipping)

16.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), a district may deviate from

terminating employees in the order of seniority, i.e., a district may skip over teachers with a
particular qualification and terminate more senior teachers who do not possess that
qualification. In order to skip, a district must demonstrate a specific need for personnel to
teach a specific course or course of study or for personnel with a specialization in personnel
services or nursing. If the need concerns a course or course of study, the district may skip a
junior employee only if employees with more seniority do not possess the special training
and experience necessary to teach the course and only if the junior employee does possess
that special training and experience.

17.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), the governing board of the
district resolved to deviate from terminating employees in the order of seniority, i.e., the
board resolved to skip over teachers with a particular qualification and terminate more senior
teachers who do not possess that qualification. A district may skip a junior employee only if
employees with more seniority do not possess the special training and experience necessary
to teach a specific course or course of study (specific course).

18.

The board resolved as follows:

The Governing Board exempts from the order of certificated
layoff, pursuant to Education Code section 44955 because of
special training, expertise, or credential that others with more
seniority do not possess:

Certificated personnel who possess a credential authorizing
service in special education, including intern specialists who are
presently assigned within the scope of that credential, and who
will be assigned within the scope of that credential for the 2012-
2013 school year.

11

Certificated personnel who possess a credential authorizing
service in American Sign Language (ASL), French, or Physical
Education with Dance authorization who are presently assigned
within the scope of any of those credentials, and who will be
assigned within the scope of the same credential for the 2012-
2013 school year.

Certificated personnel who are presently serving as Teacher on
Special Assignment (TOSA), and who will be assigned as
TOSA for the 2012-2013 school year.

19.

The district did not elect to skip any junior employee because of special

training or experience in American Sign Language or French.

20.

Lisa Brown with a seniority date of August 18, 2005, is senior to Luz Salcido,

whose seniority date is September 28, 2005. The district seeks to terminate Ms. Brown’s
position while skipping Ms. Salcido to permit her to hold a position as a teacher on special
assignment (TOSA). As noted above the board resolved to skip personnel who presently are
serving as TOSA.

21.

Bill Behrens, Ed. D., the district’s Assistant Superintendent for Human

Resources Development, testified that the district is justified in skipping Ms. Salcido not
only because she is serving as a TOSA this year but also because she has had substantial
special training, has served in the leadership counsel, and has developed an excellent rapport
with the parents at her school.

22.

Both Ms. Brown and Ms. Salcido hold a multiple subject credential. Both
hold an English Learner certification. Ms. Brown holds a Master of Arts degree, and Ms.
Salcido holds a Bachelor of Arts degree.

23. Ms. Brown testified that she has had substantial special training, including

Sheltered Observation Protocol Training. She testified that she has served in the leadership
counsel, is a Student Success Team coordinator, and has experience in supporting an English
Learner instructional aid. She testified that she is well liked by parents.

24.

As noted above, in order to skip, a district must demonstrate a specific need

for personnel to teach a specific course or course of study. A district may skip a junior
employee only if employees with more seniority do not possess the special training and
experience necessary to teach the course.

25.

The evidence regarding Ms. Brown demonstrates that the district failed to

prove that it is justified in skipping Ms. Salcido. That, however, does not necessarily mean
that Ms. Brown’s position is spared from termination. It may be, but it may not be. The
district must retain the most senior teacher who is certificated and competent to render the

12

service Ms. Salcido will be rendering. That may be Ms. Brown. It may be someone more
senior than she is.
Right to be Retained According to Seniority and Qualifications – Date of Hire

26.

Job security is not inherent in seniority. The Legislature chose to provide

teachers with limited job security according to their seniority.

27.

The respondents did not raise any issues concerning the seniority dates the

district has recorded for them.

Right to be Retained According to Seniority and Qualifications – (Bumping)

28.

The second paragraph of Code section 44955, subdivision (c), does not add to
teachers’ seniority rights. It does, however, make it clear that governing boards must make
assignments in such a way as to protect seniority rights. Employees must be retained to
render any service their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render. Thus, if a senior
teacher whose regular assignment is being eliminated is certificated and competent to teach a
junior teacher’s courses, the district must retain the senior teacher and reassign him or her to
render that service. This is commonly referred to as bumping. The district must either
reassign or terminate the junior employee.

29.

Dana Hayes, with a seniority date of November 8, 2004, is senior to Lesley

Keys, who has a seniority date of August 18, 2005. The district permitted Ms. Keys to bump
into a position to teach English. Both Ms. Hayes and Ms. Keys hold a multiple subject
credential with a supplemental authorization in English. Ms. Hayes questions why she was
not allowed to bump into the position. The district found Ms. Hayes not to be competent to
bump into the position because her authorization in English is not No-Child-Left-Behind-
(NCLB)-compliant. Ms. Keys’s authorization in English is NCLB compliant. The district
may establish NCLB compliance as a competency standard. Thus, the district may permit
Ms. Keys to bump into the position to teach English.

30.

Sheryl Ferns raised issues concerning bumping and the relative seniority of a

teacher whose Preliminary Layoff Notice was being rescinded. The district agreed to add
Ms. Ferns’s name to the list of employees whose Preliminary Layoff Notices were being
rescinded.

31.

Some of the respondents contend that they possess the qualifications required
by Code section 44256 to receive board authorization to teach outside their multiple subject
credentials in departmentalized classes. They contend that they should be granted such board
authorizations and should be permitted to bump into positions held by more junior
employees who are teaching in departmentalized classes. Respondents’ contentions are not
persuasive.

32.

It is within a board’s discretion to determine whether and when to grant
authorization under section 44256 to teach in departmentalized classes outside of one’s

13

credential. There was no evidence that any of the respondents had applied for or received
such authorization from the board. Because respondents do not possess the credentials or
board authorizations necessary to teach in departmentalized classes outside their multiple
subject credentials, they have no right to bump into those positions.

33.

Noel Trout originally contended that he had a right to bump into the positions
held by a few teachers who are junior to him. After Mr. Trout’s counsel consulted with the
district’s counsel, however, Mr. Trout agreed that he had been mistaken. Mr. Trout’s
counsel stipulated that they had not identified a position into which Mr. Trout had a right to
bump.

34.

Jennifer Nolte is a high school activities director. She does not provide a
service that comes within the particular kinds of services the board resolved to reduce or
discontinue. The district served Ms. Nolte with a precautionary Preliminary Layoff Notice in
order to guard against the risk that a teacher senior to Ms. Nolte who was subject to layoff
might prove a right to bump into Ms. Nolte’s position.

35.

Dr. Behrens testified regarding the position of a high school activities director

and the competency required to bump into that position. The following is a paraphrased
summary of part of his testimony: An activities director in a high school must coordinate all
associated student programs, oversee the budgets of student activities and clubs, and enforce
special rules regarding student fees and activity funds in compliance with recent changes in
the law.

36.

Robin Schenck, who is senior to Ms. Nolte, asserted that she had a right to

bump into Ms. Nolte’s position. Ms. Schenck, however, failed to produce sufficient
evidence that she has the competency to perform the services of an activities director.

37.

No one proved a right to bump into Ms. Nolte’s position.

Mandated Services

38.

State and federal laws mandate that certain services be provided at or above
mandated levels. There was no evidence that the district is reducing those services below
mandated levels.

Summary of Findings Regarding Retention of Employees

39.

Pursuant to the district’s stipulation, the district shall rescind the Preliminary

Layoff Notices served on the respondents listed in Findings 11 and 12.

40.

The district must retain the most senior teacher who is certificated and

competent to render the service Ms. Salcido will be rendering.

41.

The district may not serve a Termination Notice on Ms. Nolte.

14

42. With regard to respondents who are permanent employees, the district will not

be retaining any probationary employee to render a service that such a respondent is
certificated and competent to render.

43. With regard to respondents who are permanent employees, the district will not
be retaining any employee with less seniority than such a respondent has to render a service
that the respondent is certificated and competent to render.6

44. With regard to respondents who are either permanent or probationary
employees, the district will not be retaining any employee with less seniority than such a
respondent has to render a service that the respondent’s qualifications entitle him or her to
render. 7

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

General Conclusions

1.

2.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Sections 44949 and 44955. All notice

and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied.

Within the terms of Sections 44949 and 44955, the district has cause to reduce

or discontinue particular kinds of services and to give Termination Notices to certain
respondents. The cause relates solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils.

Distinguishing Between the Burden of Proof and the Burden of Producing Evidence

3.

The burden of proof remains throughout a trial with the party who has that
burden. There is a second burden, however, that can shift from one party to another – the
burden of producing evidence. After the party who has the burden of proof introduces
sufficient evidence to make a prima facie case, the burden of producing evidence shifts to the
other party. If the other party introduces evidence sufficient to avoid a ruling against him or
her on an issue, the burden of producing evidence regarding that issue shifts back to the party
with the burden of proof.

6 Section 44955, subdivision (b), provides seniority protection for a permanent

employee in terms of the services the employee is “certificated and competent to render.”

7 Section 44955, subdivision (c), provides seniority protection for both permanent and

probationary employees in terms of the services an employee’s “qualifications entitle [him
or her] to render.”

15

4.

Evidence Code section 110 provides: “ ‘Burden of producing evidence’ means
the obligation of a party to introduce evidence sufficient to avoid a ruling against him on the
issue.”

5.

Evidence Code section 115 provides: “ ‘Burden of proof’ means the obligation

of a party to establish by evidence a requisite degree of belief concerning a fact in the mind
of the trier of fact or the court.” Section 115 goes on to refer to various standards of proof
required to prove a fact.

6.

A comment by the Assembly Committee on the Judiciary notes that “the
phrases defined in Sections 110 and 115 provide a convenient means of distinguishing
between the burden of proving a fact and the burden of going forward with the evidence.”

7.

Evidence Code section 500 provides: “Except as otherwise provided by law, a

party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is
essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.”

8.

Evidence Code section 550, subdivision (a), provides: “The burden of

producing evidence as to a particular fact is on the party against whom a finding on the fact
would be required in the absence of further evidence.” Subdivision (b) provides: “The
burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is initially on the party with the burden
of proof as to that fact.”

Skipping

9.

In teacher layoff cases, a school district has the burden of proving every fact

that is required to justify terminating a senior teacher while retaining a junior teacher to
render a service the senior teacher is certificated and competent to render. With regard to
skipping, Code section 44955, subdivision (d), specifies three matters – some involving
multiple facts – that a district must prove. They are as follows: First, a district must prove
that the district has a “specific need for personnel to teach a specific course or course of
study.” As part of the proof of this matter, a district must prove: There is a need. The need
concerns teaching. The need concerns a course or course of study. Second, a district must
prove that a senior teacher does not possess “special training and experience necessary to
teach that course or course of study.” As part of the proof of this second matter, a district
must prove that special training and experience are necessary and that no senior teacher
possesses that training and experience. The focus here is on the position and what is
necessary to render the service required. If a senior teacher has the training and experience
necessary to teach the course or course of study, no issue arises concerning a junior teacher’s
training and experience.

10.

The third matter a district must prove to justify a skip comes up only if the

district first proves all of the facts required by the first two matters. If a district proves all of
those facts, an issue then arises concerning a junior teacher’s training and experience. Unless

16

a district has proven all of those facts, however, there is no issue concerning a junior
teacher’s training and experience.

11. With regard to a district’s burden to produce evidence to establish that no

senior teacher possesses the necessary training and experience, it usually is sufficient for the
district to elicit testimony to that effect. At that point, the burden of producing evidence
shifts to any senior teacher who disagrees with that testimony, i.e., the burden shifts to a
senior teacher who contends that he or she has the necessary training and experience. If a
senior teacher presents evidence sufficient to avoid a finding that he or she does not have the
necessary training and experience, the burden of producing evidence shifts back to the
district.

12.

Through the entire proceeding, however, the district has the burden of proof.

13.

In Bledsoe v. Biggs (2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 127, the third appellate district

dealt with a skipping issue. Bledsoe was senior to teachers who were skipped. Bledsoe
contended he had the special training and experience necessary to teach the course for which
the junior teachers were retained. The court did not read Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1),
as requiring one to first dispose of the issue of whether a senior teacher has the special
training and experience necessary. The court first found that Bledsoe had, at least, the
minimal training and experience necessary to teach the course. The court then reviewed the
junior teachers’ special training and experience and found that the junior teachers had special
training and experience necessary to teach the course. Finally, the court reviewed Bledsoe’s
special training and experience and found that he did not have the special training and
experience that the junior teachers had. The court said, “This evidence supports the finding
that Bledsoe does not possess the special training and experience that Gates and Sormano
possess.” (Bledsoe, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at pp. 135 - 142.)

14.

There is an ambiguity in the court’s conclusion that “Bledsoe does not possess

the special training and experience that Gates and Sormano possess.” Immediately prior to
that, the court found that “Gates and Sormano have the ‘special training and experience
necessary to teach’ [the course.]” (Bledsoe, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 142.) Thus, the
court’s conclusion concerning Bledsoe could be taken to mean that he did not possess the
special training and experience necessary to teach the course. And if the conclusion
concerning Bledsoe is read that way, it is perfectly consistent with the requirements of
Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1).

15.

If, on the other hand, one reads the court’s conclusion concerning Bledsoe as

meaning only that he did not have as much special training and experience as Gates and
Sormano had, the court failed to make an essential finding. Before a district may skip a
junior teacher, section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), requires the district to demonstrate that
personnel “with more seniority do not possess” the “special training and experience
necessary to teach [the] course . . . .”

17

16.

Layoffs must proceed in accordance with the procedures prescribed by statute,

which are to be strictly followed. (Greer v. Board of Education (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 98,
105.)

17.

Because subdivision (b) of section 44955 mandates that “the services of no

permanent employee may be terminated . . . while any probationary employee, or any other
employee with less seniority, is retained to render a service which said permanent employee
is certificated and competent to render,” junior employees may be given retention priority
pursuant to section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), only if they possess special training and
experience that their more senior counterparts lack. (Alexander v. Board of Trustees (1983)
139 Cal.App.3d 567, 571; Moreland Teachers Assn. v. Kurze (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 648,
655.)

18.

In interpreting the meaning of a statute, words must be given the meaning they

bear in ordinary usage. (In re Rojas (1979) 23 Cal.3d 152, 155.) The meaning of an
enactment should not be determined from a single word or sentence; the words must be
construed in context, and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized
to the extent possible. (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) 43
Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387; Title Ins. & Trust Co. v. County of Riverside (1989) 48 Cal.3d 84,
91.)

19.

The “special training and experience necessary” language in Code section

44955, subdivision (d)(1), must be read in context with Code section 44955, subdivision (b).
When one does that, it appears that the word “necessary” substantially limits Code section
44955, subdivision (d)(1). A district may require special training and special experience, but
a district cannot require more of either than is “necessary” to teach the course. If
“necessary” were not read in that limiting way, Code section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), could
be used to circumvent the seniority rights secured by Code section 44955, subdivision (b).
On the other hand, reading “necessary” in that limiting way harmonizes the language of the
two subdivisions.

20.

Thus, a district may not use skipping criteria that are not “necessary” to teach

a course. Requiring a certain type of experience or a certain length of experience may be
appropriate but only if it is shown to be “necessary.” There are a few decisions in which
courts have approved of a requirement of prior experience. Martin v. Kingfield School
District (1983) 35 Cal.3d 294, is an example. The case concerned the section 44956
preferred right of reappointment. An elementary school teacher who had been terminated
asserted her right to be rehired to fill a new position as a middle school science teacher, a
position for which she was credentialed. The district established a requirement of prior
experience as a middle school teacher and did not rehire Martin for the position. The case
stands for the proposition that a district, in requiring prior middle school experience for a
middle school science position, did not abuse its discretion.

18

21.

Skipping a junior teacher and terminating a senior teacher instead of

terminating the junior teacher is such a fundamental departure from the tenure system that
the legislature’s limitation of “necessary” should be strictly respected. A district should be
allowed to terminate a senior teacher for not having “necessary” experience only if the
experience actually is “necessary.”

22.

Dr. Behrens’s testimony provided little information about special training and
experience necessary to teach TOSA. As noted above, in order to justify skipping, a district
must prove what special training and experience are necessary in order to teach a specific
course or course of study. That, however, was not the focus of Dr. Behrens’s testimony. His
testimony focused on Ms. Salcido’s training and experience and the advantage to the district
of keeping her in her position. From Dr. Behrens’s testimony about Ms. Salcido, one might
infer something about the training and experience necessary to teach TOSA, but the
inferences one might draw fall far short of what a district must establish regarding necessary
training and experience. Code section 44955, subdivision (d), does not permit a comparison
of the training and experience of a senior teacher with the training and experience of a
junior teacher. What is required is a comparison of the training and experience necessary to
teach a course or course of study with the training and experience of a senior teacher.

23. With regard to Dr. Behrens’s testimony that Ms. Salcido has developed an

excellent rapport with the parents and with regard to Ms. Brown’s testimony that she is well
liked by parents, it is important to note that Code section 44955, subdivision (d), speaks in
terms of “special training and experience.” Nothing about that subdivision suggests that the
Legislature had in mind a popularity contest. The fact that a junior teacher is popular may
explain why a district wants to skip him or her, but it in no way justifies skipping.

24.

No doubt Ms. Salcido is very well qualified for what she does, but Ms.

Salcido’s qualifications are not relevant unless the district proves a few preliminary facts.
Before one comes to the issue of Ms. Salcido’s qualifications, the district must prove three
things that are essential to upholding a skip. The district failed to prove that TOSA is a
course or course of study, failed to prove that special training and experience are necessary to
teach TOSA, and failed to prove that Ms. Brown does not have the training and experience
necessary to teach TOSA.

25. Ms. Brown asserts that she has the training and experience necessary to teach
TOSA in the position Ms. Salcido is expected to hold next year. By reason of the matters set
forth in Findings 20 through 25, it is determined that Ms. Brown produced sufficient
evidence to cause the burden of producing evidence to shift back to the district, and the
district failed to prove that Ms. Brown does not have the training and experience necessary to
teach TOSA. Thus, it is determined that Ms. Brown has the training and experience
necessary to teach TOSA.

19

Conclusions Regarding Ms. Keys

26.

By reason of the matters set forth in Finding 29, it is determined that the

district may permit Ms. Keys rather than Ms. Hayes to bump onto a position to teach
English.

Conclusions Regarding Ms. Schenck

27. Ms. Schenck asserted that she is competent to bump into the position of

activities director that Ms. Nolte now holds. By reason of the matters set forth in Findings
34 through 36, it is determined that Ms. Schenck failed to produce sufficient evidence to
cause the burden of producing evidence to shift back to the district.

Conclusions Regarding Ms. Nolte

28. Ms. Nolte is a high school activities director. She does not provide a service

that comes within the particular kinds of services the board resolved to reduce or discontinue.
The district served Ms. Nolte with a precautionary notice. By reason of the matters set forth
in Findings 34 through 37, it is determined that no one proved a right to bump into Ms.
Nolte’s position. Thus, the district may not serve a Termination Notice on Ms. Nolte.

Conclusions Regarding Board Authorization

29.

It is within a board’s discretion to determine whether and when to grant

authorization under Code section 44256 to teach in departmentalized classes outside of one’s
credential. There was no evidence that any of the respondents had applied for or received
such authorization from the board. Because respondents do not possess the credentials or
board authorizations necessary to teach in departmentalized classes outside their multiple
subject credentials, they have no right to bump into those positions.

Cause Exists to Terminate Certain Respondents

30.

Cause does not exist to terminate the following: The respondents listed in

Findings 11 and 12; the most senior teacher who is certificated and competent to render the
service Ms. Salcido will be rendering; and Ms. Nolte.

31. With those exceptions, cause exists to give notice to the respondents that their

services will not be required for the ensuing school year.

1.

Pursuant to stipulation, the district shall rescind the Preliminary Layoff

Notices served on the respondents listed in Findings 11 and 12, and the district shall not give
Termination Notices to them. As to those respondents, the accusation is dismissed.

ORDER

20

2.

The district shall retain the most senior teacher who is certificated and

competent to render the service Ms. Salcido will be rendering. The district shall not serve a
Termination Notice on that teacher. As to that teacher, the accusation is dismissed.

The district shall not serve a Termination Notice on Ms. Nolte. As to Ms.

Nolte, the accusation is dismissed.

The district may serve Termination Notices on the remaining respondents.
