Respondents.

PROPOSED DECISION

Administrative Law Judge Nancy L. Rasmussen, Office of Administrative Hearings,

State of California, heard this matter on April 20, 2011, in Concord, California.

Deborah Cooksey, Associate General Counsel, represented the Mount Diablo Unified

School District.

Ernest M. Tuttle III, Attorney at Law, Tuttle & McCloskey, represented all

respondents except for Jean Bernstein, Michael Mason, Josie Pascal and Lorena Soto.

There was no appearance by or on behalf of respondents Jean Bernstein, Michael

Mason, Josie Pascal or Lorena Soto.

The matter was submitted on April 20, 2011.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Dr. Steven Lawrence made and filed the accusation in his official capacity as

Superintendent of the Mount Diablo Unified School District.

2.

Respondents are listed on Appendix A, attached hereto and by this reference
incorporated herein. Each of the 127 respondents is a certificated employee of the district.

3.

On March 8, 2011, the Board of Education adopted Resolution No. 10/11-49,

reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services for the 2011-2012 school year and
directing the superintendent or his designee to give appropriate notices to certificated
employees whose positions will be affected by the action.

4.

Prior to March 15, 2010, Superintendent Lawrence gave written notice to

respondents of the recommendation that their services will not be required for the 2011-2012

school year. The reasons for the recommendation were set forth in these preliminary layoff
notices.

5.

Respondents filed timely requests for hearing to determine if there is cause for

terminating their services for the 2011-2012 school year. An accusation was served on
respondents, and all respondents are deemed to have filed timely notices of defense. All
prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.

6.

On March 8, 2011, in order to address a projected budget deficit, the board

took action to reduce or discontinue the following particular kinds of services for the 2011-
2012 school year:

Before issuing the preliminary layoff notices, the district took into account all

positively assured attrition. The district also determined that it would not be necessary to
make all of the service reductions set forth in the board resolution for music and library
services. Accordingly, notices were sent to only 127 certificated employees.

8.

The district has a growing Latino population, and the percentage of English
Learner (EL) students is at least 40 percent. Pursuant to the board’s resolution, the district
intends to retain regardless of seniority (i.e., “skip” in the layoff process) certificated
employees who possess a BCLAD2 certificate and bilingual school psychologists. All
employees with a BCLAD certificate will be assigned next year to positions requiring such
certification.

9.

Under Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), 3 “the services of no

permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions of this section while any
probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to render a
service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.”
Subdivision (c) of this statute requires a school district to “make assignments and

2 Bilingual, Cross-Cultural, Language and Academic Development.

3 All statutory references are to the Education Code.

-3-

reassignments in such a manner that employees shall be retained to render any service which
their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render.” To meet these requirements, the
district is retaining certificated employees whose current positions are being eliminated who
are qualified to teach in other positions not impacted by the reduction of services. In a
detailed “bumping” chart, the district has worked out which employees will be reassigned
next year to positions now held by less senior employees.

10.

To serve the needs of its many EL students, the district has a longstanding
policy of requiring multiple subject classroom teachers to possess a CLAD4 certificate. A
number of respondents whose librarian positions are being eliminated hold multiple subject
teaching credentials but not CLAD certificates. Several of these librarians have enough
seniority to bump into classroom teaching positions, except that the district will not give
them these assignments because they lack CLAD certification.

Respondents argue that because the board’s resolution makes no mention of CLAD
certification being a standard of competence or skipping criterion, the district is precluded
from making CLAD a requirement for a librarian to be retained in a multiple subject teaching
position. This argument is not persuasive. The district’s requirement of CLAD as a
prerequisite for bumping into a multiple subject teaching position is in accordance with its
longstanding policy and need not be set forth in the board’s resolution.

11.

Under section 44845, a certificated employee’s seniority begins with the date

he or she “first rendered paid service in a probationary position.” Under section 44918,
subdivision (a), substitute or temporary service counts for seniority if the teacher served for
at least 75 percent of the school year and then is hired as a probationary employee for the
following school year. However, teachers do not get the benefit of this provision if they did
not substitute in a single class for 75 percent of the school year.5

12.

Respondent Philip Kubota challenges his seniority date of August 20, 2007,

but his challenge is rejected. Kubota was a respondent in the district’s layoff proceeding for
the 2009-2010 school year, and at the administrative hearing in that matter in April 2009 he
also challenged his seniority date.6 The following findings were made in that case:

4 Cross-Cultural, Language and Academic Development.

5 The predecessor statute to section 44918, with similar language to that in
subdivision (a), was interpreted by the court in Centinela Valley Secondary Teachers Assoc.
v. Centinela Valley Union High School Dist. (1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 35 to exclude substitute
service covering the absences of multiple teachers during the year.

6 Official notice is taken of the proposed decision of the undersigned administrative
law judge in OAH No. 2009030327, which was adopted by the board as its decision in the
matter.

-4-

Respondent Philip Kubota has a seniority date of August 20,
2007, but claims the date should be August 22, 2006, when he
attended new teacher orientation prior to starting a long-term
substitute assignment for the 2006-2007 school year. For the
first half of the school year, Kubota worked as a substitute for
one teacher on maternity leave. After one week off, he worked
the rest of the year as a substitute for another teacher on
maternity leave. When Kubota was hired for the 2007-2008
school year, it was as a temporary employee. Later that year, he
became a probationary employee. Kubota is not entitled to an
earlier seniority date because 1) he did not serve as a substitute
in a single class for 75 percent of the 2006-2007 school year,
and 2) he was not employed as a probationary teacher for the
2007-2008 school year.

Since Kubota’s challenge to his seniority date was litigated in the prior layoff

proceeding, the findings in that case apply in the current proceeding.

13.

Respondent Kimberly Anderson has a seniority date of August 31, 2007, but
claims it should be August 20, 2007, the day she started working in the classroom that year.
During the previous year, Anderson taught as a long-term substitute under a short-term staff
permit, and during the summer she finished her academic work for a teaching credential.
When she started work on August 20, 2007, her short-term staff permit had expired and she
did not yet have her teaching credential. After applying for her credential, Anderson
obtained a temporary county certificate (TCC) signed on August 30, 2007. Presumably, the
district received this TCC the following day. Anderson is not entitled to a seniority date
earlier than the date her TCC was on file with the district.

14.

Respondent Anne Meyer has a seniority date of November 9, 2006, but claims

it should be the first day of the 2006-2007 school year. Meyer set the classroom up and
worked that entire year teaching the same class. However, she was initially hired as a
substitute while the regular teacher was on maternity leave, and only after the teacher went
on unpaid family leave did the district give Meyer a contract as a temporary employee.
Meyer signed that contract on November 9, 2006. The district is not required to count her
prior substitute service for purposes of seniority.

15.

Respondent June Kirske questions her seniority date of August 22, 2007. Two

days earlier, on August 20, the school principal interviewed her in the morning and in the
afternoon offered her a teaching position. He told Kirske her starting date would be August
22, but he invited her to attend the grade level planning meeting held on August 21. Kirske
attended this meeting, and also on August 21 she was fingerprinted by the district.7 On

7 Kirske was required to be fingerprinted for the teaching job, even though she had
worked for the district since 1999 as a noon league coordinator and been fingerprinted for
that job.

-5-

August 22, she signed her contract. Kirske is not entitled to a seniority date earlier than the
date of her contract.

16.

Respondent Katrina Samoa has a seniority date of January 17, 2007, but

claims it should be October 30, 2006. On that day she started in the classroom teaching sixth
grade core. Because she did not yet have a teaching credential, Samoa was allowed to work
in that classroom for only six weeks. She then worked as a roving substitute until January
17, 2007, when her credential was issued and she returned to the classroom where she had
started on October 30. Samoa is not entitled to a seniority date earlier than the date she had a
credential.

17.

Respondent Ryann Kuiper started working for the district as a librarian on

August 23, 2007, and she questions why she is at the bottom of the seniority list, along with
the interns. Kuiper’s lack of seniority is because she is employed under an emergency
librarian credential. Service under an emergency credential does not count toward attaining
permanent status (§ 44911; Summerfield v. Windsor Unified School Dist. (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 1026), and the district is not required to count such service for seniority
purposes. To do so could result in an employee with only an emergency credential having
greater seniority than a fully-credentialed employee.

Kuiper holds a multiple subject credential, but that does not entitle her to accrue
seniority from her hire date because she has not worked under that credential for this district.

18.

All contentions made by respondents not specifically addressed above are

found to be without merit and are rejected.

19.

No certificated employee junior in seniority to any respondent is being

retained by the district to perform services that any respondent is certificated and competent
to render.
