BEFORE THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE 
TUSTIN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 
 
 

     OAH No. 2010030084 

In the Matter of the Accusation Against: 
 
CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES, 
 
By 
 
TUSTIN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. 
 
 

 

 

PROPOSED DECISION 

Howard W. Cohen, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) with the Office of 

Administrative Hearings, heard this matter on April 19, 2010, at Pioneer Middle School in 
Tustin, California. 

Anthony P. De Marco, Attorney at Law, Atkinson, Andelson, Loya, Ruud & Romo, 

represented the Tustin Unified School District (TUSD). 

Carlos R. Perez, Attorney at Law, Reich, Adell & Cvitan, represented all Respondents 

listed in Appendix I, with the exception noted directly below. 

Respondent Elizabeth Shenton was present at the hearing and represented herself. 

Oral and documentary evidence was received and the record was closed.  The record 

was reopened on April 30, 2010, to allow the District to submit additional evidence and 
briefing, and to allow Respondents to reply.  On May 3, 2010, the District submitted a post-
hearing brief and supporting declaration with exhibits.  The brief, declaration, and exhibits 
were collectively marked for identification and received as the District’s Exhibit 13.  
Respondents did not submit a reply. 

The record was again closed and the matter was submitted for decision on May 4, 

2010. 

FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1. 

Julie Mitchell, Chief Personnel Officer of the Tustin Unified School District, 

filed the Accusation while acting in her official capacity as the designee of the TUSD 
Superintendent. 

2. 

Respondents are certificated employees of the District. 

3. 

On March 8, 2010, the TUSD Superintendent recommended, with regard to 
the ensuing school year, that the TUSD Governing Board (the Board) reduce or eliminate 

 

1

particular kinds of services provided by TUSD and that certain certificated employees be 
notified that their services would not be required for the 2010-2011 school year. 

4. 

On March 8, 2010, the Board, in Resolution No. 03-51-10, adopted the 

Superintendent’s recommendation to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services 
provided by TUSD, no later than the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year.  Specifically, 
the resolution provided for the reduction or elimination of 159.4 full-time equivalent (FTE) 
positions in those particular kinds of services.  (See Exhibit A to the Board Resolution, 
attached hereto as Appendix I.) 

5. 

The resolution also included a list and description of the criteria (tie-breaking 

criteria) to be applied by TUSD to determine the order of layoff for those certificated 
employees who first rendered paid service to the Board in a probationary position on the 
same date. 

6. 

On March 9, 2010, TUSD served written notice under the direction of the 

Board that the services of certain probationary and permanent certificated employees would 
not be required in the upcoming 2010-2011 school year. 

7. 

On March 9, 2010, TUSD served written notice under the direction of the 

Board that the services of certain temporary certificated employees would not be required in 
the upcoming 2010-2011 school year. 

8. 

One hundred forty-five certificated employees timely requested, in writing, a 
hearing to determine whether cause existed for not reemploying them for the ensuing school 
year. 

9. 

On March 22 and March 23, 2010, TUSD’s Superintendent timely served an 
Accusation, Notice of Defense, Notice of Hearing, and related materials on each of the 145 
individuals who had timely returned hearing requests. 

10. 

The certificated employees who were served with the Accusation and related 

materials were identified as Respondents.  (See Appendix II attached hereto.) 

11.  One hundred twenty-seven individuals timely returned notices of defense. 

12. 

Respondents included those employed by TUSD as probationary or permanent 

certificated employees and those employed by TUSD as temporary employees.  At the 
hearing, TUSD explained that it intended to include its temporary employees in the hearing 
process, as directed by the Board, even though it asserted that temporary employees are not 
entitled to the protections afforded by sections 44949 and 44955. 

13. 

The Board considered all known attrition, resignations, retirements, and 

requests for transfer in determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices to deliver 
to its employees. 

 

2

14. 

The District maintains a seniority list that contains employees’ seniority dates, 

current assignments, classifications, and credentials, as well as information related to tie-
breaking criteria. 

15. 

The District used the seniority list to develop a proposed layoff list. The 

District considered each teacher’s credentials and certifications.  The District determined that 
no teacher less senior than Respondents was being retained to render services that 
Respondents are certificated and competent to render. 

16. 

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related to the 

welfare of TUSD and its pupils.  The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of 
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of TUSD, as 
determined by the Board. 

17. 

The Board considered all known attrition, including resignations, retirements, 
and requests for transfer, in determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices to be 
delivered to its employees. 

18. 

The District skipped and retained employees, regardless of classification, 

teaching or working in the following services not being reduced or eliminated:  speech and 
language pathology, special day class—moderate/severe, nursing, psychology, transition 
program requiring moderate/severe credentialing, adaptive physical education, and athletics.  
Respondents raised no issue as to these matters.   

19. 

In cases where several Respondents shared a first date of paid service, TUSD 

was required to apply the tiebreaking criteria approved by the Board.  The Board’s resolution 
number 03-51-10 established tiebreaker criteria that were fair and reasonable.  The District 
used information from its seniority list to apply the tiebreaker criteria of the Board’s 
Resolution No. 03-51-10 fairly and appropriately. 

20. 

Respondents Rachel Romero, Kendal Dudley, and Dana Campfield presented 

various claims in defense. 

21. 

Rachel Romero, a probationary employee who appears as No. 819 on the 

District’s seniority list, is being reduced 0.6 FTE in mathematics, 0.2 FTE by reassignment 
of Michelle Siteman, No. 377 on the District’s seniority list, and 0.2 FTE by reassignment of 
Natasha Hamlin, No. 186 on the District’s seniority list.  Mathematics in grades 9 through 12 
is a particular kind of service that the Board determined by resolution to reduce or eliminate 
by 3.8 FTE.  Ms. Romero has a single subject mathematics credential and a CLAD 
credential; during the 2009-2010 school year, she taught pre-calculus and AP statistics.  Ms. 
Romero contends that she should skip Ms. Siteman because she had increased her 
competency, training, and experience by taking a one-week course on AP statistics.  Ms. 
Siteman, a permanent employee, has a single subject mathematics credential and a CLAD 
credential; during the 2009-2010 school year, she taught algebra 1, algebra 1/CAHSEE, and 
geometry.  Ms. Hamlin, a permanent employee, has a single subject English credential and a 
CLAD credential.  By resolution of the Board under authority of section 44258.3, Ms. 
Hamlin has taught mathematics in the District since July 1998.  During the 2009-2010 school 
year, the District assigned Ms. Hamlin to teach algebra 1 and 2, and geometry CC/CAHSEE 

 

3

math.  The District testified that it had taken into account Ms. Romero’s increased training 
and experience in the reassignment process.  The District further testified that it only 
reassigned credentialed and competent senior employees to courses currently taught by less 
senior employees.  The District found a teacher “competent” if the teacher had training or 
classroom teaching experience in the particular kind of service. 

22. 

TUSD and Respondent Kendal Dudley stipulated that Ms. Dudley was a 

permanent employee of TUSD when she resigned as of June 2007.  They further stipulated 
that when TUSD employed Ms. Dudley on February 12, 2010, she was on a temporary 
assignment and signed an “acceptance of offer of temporary employment” with the District.  
Ms. Dudley contended that, because she was re-employed by the District within 39 months 
of her resignation, she should have been credited with the seniority attendant upon her pre-
resignation employment and been reinstated as a permanent employee. 

23. 

Respondent Dana Campfield, No. 872 on the District’s seniority list, was 

employed by the District on a temporary assignment teaching elective music courses in the 
sixth through eighth grades at Utt Middle School.  Ms. Campfield contended that, for the 
2009-2010 school year, the District should have offered her a position teaching high school 
choir, a position taken by No. 848 on the District’s seniority list.  No. 848 is a permanent 
employee with a seniority date of August 27, 2009.  Respondent Campfield had been a 
permanent employee with a seniority date of 1998 or 1999 and was teaching high school 
band when the District terminated her services as part of a reduction in force at the end of the 
2008-2009 school year. 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

All notice and jurisdictional requirements set forth in Education Code sections 

44949 and 44955 were met.1 

2. 

Cause exists to sustain TUSD’s action to reduce or discontinue 159.4 full-

time-equivalent positions, as set forth in TUSD’s resolution number 03-51-10 for the 2010-
2011 school year, under sections 44949 and 44955, as set forth in Factual Findings 1-23, and 
Legal Conclusions 1 and 3-12. 

3. 

The services identified in the Board’s resolution number 03-51-10 are 

particular kinds of services that the Board may reduce or discontinue under section 44955.  
The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the identified services was not arbitrary or 
capricious, and was a proper exercise of its discretion.  Cause for the reduction or 
discontinuation of services relates solely to the welfare of TUSD’s schools and pupils within 
the meaning of section 44949. 

4. 

Section 44955, subdivision (b), provides, in pertinent part: 

[W]henever a particular kind of service is to be reduced or 
discontinued not later than the beginning of the following school 

                                                

1 All further statutory references are to the Education Code. 

 

4

year . . . , and when in the opinion of the governing board of the 
district it shall have become necessary by reason of any of these 
conditions to decrease the number of permanent employees in 
the district, the governing board may terminate the services of 
not more than a corresponding percentage of the certificated 
employees of the district, permanent as well as probationary, at 
the close of the school year. 

5. 

Section 44955, subdivision (c), provides, in pertinent part: 

[S]ervices of such employees shall be terminated in the inverse 
of the order in which they were employed . . . . 

The governing board shall make assignments and reassignments 
in such a manner that employees shall be retained to render any 
service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to 
render. 

6. 

TUSD identified the certificated employees providing the particular kinds of 

services that the Board directed to be reduced or discontinued.  A school district may reduce 
services within the meaning of section 44955, subdivision (b), “either by determining that a 
certain type of service to students shall not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it 
may ‘reduce services’ by determining that proffered services shall be reduced in extent 
because fewer employees are made available to deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford 
v. Board of Trustees, supra, 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 178-179.) 

7. 

The District considered seniority and qualifications, as set forth in Factual 
Findings 14 and 15, and properly made assignments and reassignments in its discretion in 
accordance with section 44955, subdivision (c).  (See, e.g., Brough v. Governing Bd. of the 
El Segundo Unified School Dist. (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 702, 716-717.) 

8. 

No junior certificated employee is scheduled to be retained to perform services 

that a more senior employee is certificated and competent to render. 

9. 

The District properly laid off Rachel Romero. 

a. 

The District considered seniority and qualifications, as set forth in 

Factual Findings 10 and 11, and properly made assignments and reassignments in its 
discretion in accordance with section 44955, subdivision (c).  (See, e.g., Brough v. 
Governing Bd. of the El Segundo Unified School Dist. (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 702, 
716-717.) 

b.  With respect to the assignment of Ms. Hamlin to 0.2 FTE of Ms. 
Romero’s current assignment, section 44258.3 provides that a governing board may 
assign the holder of any credential, other than an emergency credential, to teach in 
any departmentalized class in grades K through 12 if it determines prior to assignment 
that the teacher has sufficient knowledge of the subject to be taught, and if the teacher 
consents to the assignment.  Section 44955, subdivision (c), expands upon the term 

 

5

“qualifications” by allowing a board to assign or reassign a senior certificated 
employee to teach a subject he or she has not previously taught and for which he or 
she does not have a teaching credential, under certain conditions.  This statutory 
language supports the District’s discretionary conclusion that Ms. Hamlin, a senior 
certificated employee being reassigned to teach a subject she has previously taught 
and of which the Board has found her to have adequate knowledge, possesses 
“qualifications” under section 44955, subdivision (c). 

10. 

The District properly laid off Kendal Dudley. 

a. 

Ms. Dudley’s argument as to seniority lacks merit.  Section 44931 

provides that when a permanent certificated employee resigns and “is reemployed 
within 39 months after his or her last day of paid service, the governing board of the 
district shall, disregarding the break in service, classify him or her as, and restore to 
him or her all of the rights, benefits and burdens of, a permanent employee, except as 
otherwise provided in this code.”  (Italics added.)  Section 44848 provides otherwise 
as to seniority rights.  If a certificated employee resigns and is later reemployed, her 
date of employment “shall be deemed to be the date on which [s]he first accepted 
reemployment . . . .”  (§ 44848.)  In this case, that date is February 12, 2010.  (See 
San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 641 (break in service 
not disregarded for purposes of seniority rights).) 

b. 

The District properly classified Ms. Dudley as a temporary employee.  
Section 44920 permits the District, under conditions discussed below, to “employ as a 
teacher . . . any person holding appropriate certification documents, and may classify 
such person as a temporary employee.”  (§ 44920.)  Section 44920 requires that the 
temporary position be for a duration of at least one full semester during a school year, 
“unless the date of rendering first paid service begins during the second semester and 
prior to March 15th . . .”  (§ 44920.)   Section 44920 also requires that the temporary 
employment be based on the need for an additional certificated employee because, 
among other reasons, an employee has been granted a leave of absence.  The District 
and Ms. Dudley entered a contract for temporary employment from February 6 to 
June 15, 2010, to replace a certificated employee on leave of absence.  The conditions 
for classifying Ms. Dudley as a temporary employee under section 44920 have, 
therefore, been satisfied.  (See Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Assn. v. Bakersfield 
City School Dist. (2007) 145 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1281-1283 (Bakersfield).)  
“Classification . . . determines an employee’s rights in the context of a layoff.”  
(California Teachers Assn. v. Vallejo City Unified School Dist. (2007) 179 
Cal.App.4th 135, 145 (Vallejo).)   As a temporary employee under section 44920, 
Respondent Dudley’s rights are determined by the terms of her temporary 
employment contract, not by her prior permanent status.  (Balen v. Peralta Junior 
College Dist. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 821, 826.) 

11. 

The District properly laid off Dana Campfield. 

a. 

The District chose to use federal stimulus money received under the 

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a one-time funding source for the 

 

6

2009-2010 school year, to offer the middle school elective courses that Ms. 
Campfield currently teaches.  The position for which the District employed Ms. 
Campfield for the 2009-2010 school year is, therefore, a “categorically funded 
project,” one of the limited statutory grounds for properly classifying Ms. Campfield 
as a temporary employee.  (§ 44909; see Zalac v. Governing Bd. of the Ferndale 
Unified School Dist. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838, 844-848.)  “Classification 
determines an employee’s rights in the context of a layoff.”  (Vallejo, supra, 179 
Cal.App.4th 135, 145.)  As a temporary employee, Respondent Campfield’s rights are 
determined by the terms of her temporary employment contract, not by her prior 
permanent status.  (Balen v. Peralta Junior College Dist., supra, 11 Cal.3d 821, 826.) 

b. 

Because Respondent Campfield was, as of June 2009, a permanent 

employee whose services the District terminated last year under section 44955, she 
retains a preferred right to reemployment.  (§ 44956, subd. (a)(1).)  Whether 
Respondent Campfield had a right last summer to be rehired to fill a permanent 
position for the 2009-2010 school year, instead of the temporary position she 
accepted, does not come within the jurisdiction of the ALJ to decide at this hearing. 

12. 

“[T]emporary employees, unlike permanent and probationary employees, may 

be dismissed at the pleasure of the board and need be given only a more limited form of 
notice before the end of the school year, and no hearing.”  (Bakersfield, supra, 145 
Cal.App.4th 1260, 1273; see also Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma County Union High School 
Dist. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 917-918.)  The Bakersfield court also noted, however, that 
“certificated teachers assigned to a categorically funded program may be laid off without the 
procedural formalities due a permanent and probationary employee only if the program has 
expired.  (Bakersfield, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at p. 1287.)  Here, all Respondents, including 
those assigned to categorically funded programs, though temporary employees, were entitled 
to participate in the instant hearing.  Based on the evidence presented, TUSD may take action 
with respect to its temporary employees, as it requests. 

ORDER 

The Accusation served on those Respondents identified by testimony as providing the 
particular kinds of services that the Board directed to be reduced or discontinued, amounting 
to 159.4 full-time-equivalent positions, is sustained. 

Notice shall be given to Respondents, as required by law, that their services will be 

terminated at the close of the 2009-2010 academic year.  Notice shall be given in inverse 
order of seniority. 

// 

// 

// 

// 

// 

 

7

Notice shall be given to those Respondents identified as temporary employees, except 

those assigned to teach or work in a service not being reduced or eliminated, that their 
services will be terminated at the close of the 2009-2010 academic year.
