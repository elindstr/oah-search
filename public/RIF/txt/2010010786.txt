Following the March 17, 2010 hearing, the parties reached agreement as to the 
remaining certificated employees whose hearing was noticed for April 9, 2010.  Based on the 
agreement of the parties, Melinda Nardinelli will be permitted to teach the ROP Careers in 
Education course currently taught by Jill Whitmire.  As a result, it was agreed that Jill 
Whitmire will receive a final layoff notice and Melinda Nardinelli’s notice will be rescinded. 
It was also agreed that each of the multiple subject certificated employees who received a 
layoff notice designating April 9, 2010, as their hearing date shall have his or her layoff 
notice rescinded.  These employees are:

The parties also agreed that as a result of the rescission of notices to multiple 

 
 
subject teachers, the District will also rescind notices to the following certificated employees:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Tippet, Robert  
Holton, Jeanine  
Bergsten, Amy  
Gray, David (District will rescind 0.6 FTE)

2 The first four names were included in the first stipulation as persons whose notices the District intended to 

rescind. Ms. Barr-Smith was listed as a certificated employee teaching reading who would receive a final layoff 
notice. The second stipulation specifically rescinding the notice to Ms. Barr-Smith obviously supercedes the first.
