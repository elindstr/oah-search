3. 

The Board resolved as follows: 

•  That due to the reduction or discontinuance of particular kinds 
of services pursuant to California Education Code Section 
49955,2 the legal number of certificated employees of the 
District not be [sic] re-employed for the 2010-2011 is as set 
forth above; and 

•  That the Superintendent is directed to give Notices of 

Recommendation Not to Re-Employ in accordance with the 
provisions of the California Education Code Section 44949 and 
Section 44955 to the appropriate certificated employees 
pursuant to Section 44955 and to otherwise implement this 
reduction in force pursuant to law; . . . 

4. 

On February 26, 2010, the District served the following certificated employees 
with written notice, pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, that their services 
would not be required for the next school year (Notice):  Katharine Pelle; Rod Tayler; 
Debbie Ramey; Karen Everett; and Eren Linstadt.  Each Notice set forth the reasons for the 
recommendation.  The Notice states that, “[t]he reasons for this action are set forth in the 
attached resolution adopted by the Board of Trustees on February 9, 2010.”  A copy of 
Resolution No. 10-08 was included with the Notice.  The District served the employees by 
certified mail and personal delivery on February 26, 2010.  Respondents Karen Everett and 
Eren Linstadt each acknowledged receipt of the Notice on February 26, 2010. 
 

5. 

On February 26, 2010, respondent Everett submitted her request for hearing to 

determine if there is cause for not reemploying her for the 2010-2011 school year (Hearing 
Request).  Respondent Linstadt submitted her Hearing Request on March 4, 2010.  The 
Hearing Requests were timely. 
 

6. 

On March 9, 2010, the Board adopted Resolution No. 10-09, which reduced 

and/or discontinued the following particular kinds of certificated services for the 2010-2011 
school year: 
 

Grades K-8 Classroom Teacher 

 

2.0

Prior to March 15, 2010, the District served a Notice on the following 

certificated employees as a result of the adoption of Resolution No. 10-09:  Allison Peres, 
and Stacy Stroup.  Neither Ms. Stroup nor Ms. Peres filed Hearing Requests. 
  

9. 

On March 9, 2010, the Board adopted Resolution No. 10-09, which reduced 

and/or discontinued the following particular kinds of certificated services for the 2010-2011 
school year:

Resolution No. 10-10 contained the language set forth in Finding 3 (with 

typographical error corrected). 
 

11. 

Prior to March 15, 2010, the District served a Notice on certificated employee 
Shannon Jacinto as a result of the adoption of Resolution No. 10-10.  Ms. Jacinto did not file 
a Hearing Request. 
 

12.  Any certificated employee who failed to file a request for hearing has waived 

his or her right to a hearing, and may be laid off by the District. 
 

13. 

The Superintendent made and filed an Accusation against respondents, who 

were the only certificated employees who requested a hearing.  The Accusation, dated April 
6, 2010, along with required accompanying documents and blank Notices of Defense 
(Accusation packet) was timely served on respondents.   
 

14. 

Respondents, through their counsel, timely filed a Notice of Defense. 

15. 

Each respondent is presently a certificated permanent or probationary 

employee of the District. 
 

[¶] . . . [¶] 

16. 

The April 6, 2010 Accusation states, in pertinent part: 

On or about February 26, 2010 and March 9, 2010, the 

Governing Board of Foresthill Union Elementary School 
District (“the Governing Board”) was given written notice of my 
[the Superintendent’s] recommendations that notice be given to 
Respondents, pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 
44955, that their services will not be required for the ensuing 
school year and stating the reasons therefor.

Cause exists within the meaning of Education Code 

sections 44949 and 44955 for not reemploying Respondents for

the District beginning not later than the commencement of the 
2010-2011 school year as set forth in the Governing Board 
Resolution No. 10-09 and Resolution 10-10, attached hereto and 
incorporated by reference 

In the opinion of the Governing Board, it will be 
necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees in 
the District on account of the above reduction or discontinuance 
of services.  As a consequence, the Governing Board has 
determined that the services of certified employees, equal in 
number to those employees providing services to be reduced or 
discontinued, shall be terminated at the close of the current 
2009-2010 school year. 

[¶] . . . [¶] 

17.  As set forth above, the April 6, 2010 Accusation did not refer to, attach or 

incorporate by reference Resolution No. 10-08, adopted by the Board on February 9, 2010. 
 

18.  On April 23, 2010, respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss with OAH, based on 

their contention that the April 6, 2010 Accusation does not apply to them, and that 
Resolution No. 10-09 (2.0 FTE Grades K-8 Classroom Teacher) had superseded Resolution 
No. 10-08 (4.0 FTE Grades K-8 Classroom Teacher). 
 

19.  On April 23, 2010, the District filed an Amended Accusation, which states in 

pertinent part:3

Services to be Reduced or Eliminated 
 

21. 

The District provides educational services to approximately 480 students from 

kindergarten through the eighth grade (K-8) at two school sites.  As reflected on the 
District’s Certificated Employees Seniority List for 2009-2010, the District employs 25 
certificated employees.  The District has experienced declining enrollment since the 1996-
1997 school year (823 students), and enrollment has dropped from 582 students in the 2005-
2006 school year to its current level.  The District expects the average daily attendance 
(ADA) for next year to be approximately 462 students.  As a result of the decline in ADA, 
revenue to the District has been substantially reduced.  In addition, there have been cutbacks 
in categorically funded programs, and in general fund revenues, as a consequence of the 
budget crisis affecting the State of California.   
 

22.  According to Mr. Roberts, his initial recommendation to the Board, as 
reflected in Resolution No. 2010-08, contemplated a reduction in classroom teaching staff 
from 21 teachers to 17 teachers.  However, Mr. Roberts thereafter concluded that the District 
“needed other options” in case revenue did not meet projections.  Therefore, he 
recommended additional reductions in certificated services, namely a further reduction in 
classroom teaching staff to 16 classroom teachers, and elimination of a principal position.  
Since the certificated employee in the principal position had return rights to the classroom, 
this resulted in the reduction of an additional 2.0 FTE K-8 classroom teachers (Resolution 
No. 2010-09) in conjunction with the reduction of the 1.0 FTE principal position (Resolution 
2010-10). 
 

23.  When the Board adopted Resolutions No. 2010-09 and 2010-10, it did not 
direct the Superintendent to rescind Resolution No. 2010-08.  The combined total of the three 
resolutions resulted in a proposed reduction in the certificated staff by 8.0 FTE positions.  As 
of the date of hearing, the District has not rescinded any of the Notices sent to certificated 
employees. 
 

24. 

The above-described services are “particular kinds of services” (PKS) that can 
be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.  The PKS 
reductions and eliminations are based solely upon financial reasons, and are not related to the 
skills, abilities or work performance of the affected faculty members. 
 
Motion to Dismiss 
 

25. 

Respondents hold multiple subject (MS) credentials.  Respondent Everett 

teaches fourth grade, and respondent Linstadt teaches eighth grade.  Respondents contend 
that, by adopting Resolution No. 2010-09, the Board passed a superseding resolution for a 
reduction of 2.0 FTE grades K-8 classroom teacher positions, and that the April 6, 2010 
Accusation sought to effectuate only a reduction of 2.0 FTE K-8 classroom teachers and 1.0 
FTE principal, by its failure to reference Resolution No. 2010-08.  As reflected on the  

 

6

District’s seniority list, Katharine Pelle, Roderick Tayler, and Debbie Ramey have less 
seniority than respondents;4 thus, if only 2.0 FTE K-8 classroom teachers are subject to 
layoff, neither respondent would be affected. 
 

26. 

In support of their argument that Resolution No. 2010-08 was superseded by 

Resolution No. 2010-09, respondents rely on the language in Resolution No.  2010-09, which 
stated:  “NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Trustees of the Foresthill 
Union School District as follows: That due to the reduction or discontinuance of particular 
kinds of services pursuant to California Education Code Section 44955, the legal number of 
certificated employees of the District not be re-employed for the 2010-2011 is as set forth 
above,” namely, 2.0 FTE Grades K-8 Classroom Teacher. (Emphasis added.) 
 

27. 

Respondents’ contention is not persuasive.  As set forth in Findings 3, 7, and 

10, this same language appeared in all three resolutions adopted by the Board.  If respondents 
are correct, then Resolution No. 2010-10 would have superseded both Resolution No. 2010-
08 and 2010-09, which was clearly not the case.  Instead, the language cited by respondents 
refers to the number of certificated employees that may legally be subject to layoff under 
each resolution.  There is nothing in Resolution No. 2010-09 to indicate that it intended to 
replace Resolution No. 2010-08.  As established by the testimony of Mr. Roberts, 
Resolutions No. 2010-09 and 2010-10 were adopted by the Board in anticipation of a 
possible worsening of the District’s financial situation, and reflect the need for additional 
reductions in certificated staff.  The District’s position is buttressed by the fact that the 
District sent Notices to additional certificated staff as a consequence of the adoption of 
Resolution No. 2010-09.  If the District had intended to lay off fewer teachers as a result of 
the adoption of Resolution No. 2010-09, it would have rescinded Notices, not issued 
additional Notices. 
 

28. 

Furthermore, respondents were not prejudiced by the District’s failure to 
initially refer to Resolution No. 2010-08 in the April 6, 2010 Accusation.  Respondents 
received proper notice under Education Code section 44949, subdivision (a), that their 
services will not be required for the 2010-2011 school year, and stating the reasons therefor.  
As set forth in Finding 4, the Notice attached Resolution No. 2010-08, listing a reduction of 
4.0 FTE Grades K-8 Classroom Teacher positions. 
 

29. 

The District’s failure to cite Resolution No. 2010-08 in the April 6, 2010 

Accusation was a “nonsubstantive procedural error committed by the school district” which 
was not prejudicial error, within the meaning of Education Code section 44949, subdivision 
(c)(3).  This procedural error was corrected by the District when it filed the Amended 
Accusation on April 23, 2010.  Education Code section 44949, subdivision (c), states in 
pertinent part:  “In the event a hearing is requested by the employee, the proceeding shall be 

                                                

4 Ms. Pelle holds a credential to teach physical education, and would be subject to layoff under Resolution 

No. 2010-08 for 1.0 FTE Physical Education Teacher.  If Resolution No. 2010-08 was superseded by Resolution No. 
2010-09, that reduction presumably would be eliminated.  Mr. Tayler and Ms. Ramey hold MS credentials; Mr. 
Tayler teaches seventh grade, and Ms. Ramey teaches sixth grade, and would account for 2.0 FTE.

conducted and a decision made in accordance with Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 
11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code and the governing board 
shall have all the power granted to an agency therein, . . .” with certain limited exceptions not  
pertinent to respondents’ argument.  Government Code section 11507 specifically allows for 
amendment of the Accusation.5
 

30. 

Respondents’ citation of Karbach v. Board of Education (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 

355 (Karbach) does not support their argument.  In Karbach, the district sent notice to 
teachers prior to March 15 of the then-current school year that they would not be reemployed 
for the ensuing school year due to a decline in ADA, under the predecessor statute to what is 
now Education Code section 44955.  The accusation filed and served by the district likewise 
referred to a drop in ADA as the reason for terminating the teachers.  At the hearing, the 
district sought to introduce evidence supporting the termination of teachers due to a 
reduction in PKS.  The court held that the teachers were not lawfully subject to termination 
for a reason (reduction of services) not specified in the notice of recommendation served on 
or before March 15, 1972. (Id., at p. 363.)  The court found that notice of the reason for the 
termination of services by March 15 of the then-current school year was jurisdictionally 
mandatory, not directory. (Id., at p. 364.)  In contrast, the court found that the failure of the 
accusation to adequately state the reasons for termination would not require dismissal of the 
accusation and retention of the employees: 
 

The Administrative Procedure Act relates to the hearing stage 
which is “initiated by filing an accusation.” (Gov. Code, § 
11503.) Section 13447 of the Education Code, insofar as it 
adopts the requirement of a notice of recommendation, states a 
condition precedent to any hearing being called for.  Both may 
operate in a given case.  An accusation might well be filed 
which did not set forth facts supporting reasons adequately 
specified in the original notice of recommendation.  Under 
such circumstances, an amendatory accusation would be 
appropriate under conditions stated in section 11507 of the 
Government Code. 

   
(Id., at p. 363; emphasis supplied.) 
 

                                                

5 Government Code section 11507 states: 
 
At any time before the matter is submitted for decision the agency may file or permit the filing of 
an amended or supplemental accusation. All parties shall be notified thereof. If the amended or 
supplemental accusation presents new charges the agency shall afford respondent a reasonable 
opportunity to prepare his defense thereto, but he shall not be entitled to file a further pleading 
unless the agency in its discretion so orders. Any new charges shall be deemed controverted, and 
any objections to the amended or supplemental accusation may be made orally and shall be noted 
in the record. 

 

8

31.  Unlike the situation in Karbach, the respondents in this case received timely 

and proper notice of the reason for their proposed non-reemployment for the 2010-2011 
school year.  The District was entitled under the Administrative Procedure Act to file the 
Amended Accusation to correct a nonsubstantive procedural error in its pleading, by 
including facts supporting the reasons for non-reemployment set forth in the Notice received 
by respondents.  Under all of the facts and circumstances, the Motion to Dismiss is denied. 
 
ADA vs. PKS Layoff 
 

32. 

Respondents contended that the testimony of the Superintendent, as well as the 

plain language of the resolutions adopted by the Board, established that the reason for the 
layoff was a decline in ADA, and not a reduction in PKS.  Education Code section 44955, 
subdivision (b), states in pertinent part:  “Whenever in any school year the average daily 
attendance in all of the schools of a district for the first six months in which school is in 
session shall have declined below the corresponding period of either of the previous two 
school years, …[or] whenever a particular kind of service is to be reduced or discontinued 
not later than the beginning of the following school year, … and when in the opinion of the 
governing board of the district it shall have become necessary by reason of any of these 
conditions to decrease the number of permanent employees in the district, the governing 
board may terminate the services of not more than a corresponding percentage of the 
certificated employees of the district, permanent as well as probationary, at the close of the 
school year.”  Respondents contended that the District did not perform the mathematical 
calculation necessary to determine the percentage decline in ADA in order to calculate the 
number of teachers whose services were to be terminated.  Thus, respondents argue that 
number of teachers slated for layoff is excessive, in that it is not supported by the decline in 
ADA. 
 

33. 

Respondents’ contention is not persuasive.  While Mr. Roberts stated that the 

decline in ADA was one of the primary justifications for the layoff, the resolutions 
themselves reference not only declining enrollment, but also “the necessary cutbacks in 
general fund and categorical programs.”  Declining enrollment is tied to a loss of revenue by 
the District.  The District chose to address this financial crisis by identifying PKS to be 
reduced or eliminated, rather than by eliminating teaching positions on a strict percentage 
basis corresponding to a decline in ADA.  The District properly exercised its discretion by 
implementing a PKS layoff.  The fact that the resolutions acknowledge declining enrollment 
as an underlying cause of the financial deficit did not transform the proceedings into an ADA 
layoff. 
 
Milestones Cooperative Charter School 
 

34. 

The District is in the process of considering whether to create a charter school 
for the 2010-2011 school year.  Mr. Roberts has developed a draft proposal tentatively called 
Milestones Cooperative Charter School.  As of the date of hearing, no petition to establish 
the charter school has been presented to the Board.  No public hearings have been held on the 
issue of whether a charter school should be established, or the proposed terms of the charter 

 

9

school.  If the Board approves a charter school petition, the District would still need to obtain 
approval from the State Department of Education before the charter school could be 
established. 
 

35. 

Respondents contend that, if Milestones Cooperative Charter School is 
established, there will be vacancies in teaching services that they are certificated and 
competent to render.  They argue that they cannot be laid off when the District is seeking to 
hire additional personnel for the charter school. 
 

36. 

Respondents’ arguments are not persuasive.  A proposal for the charter school 

has not been presented to the Board, and its approval is uncertain.  Element 13 of the 
proposed charter states that, “[t]he Milestones Cooperative Charter School shall be 
considered the employer for all employees working at the charter School.”  While some 
employment rights of District employees will be protected for a two-year period if they are 
accepted to teach at the charter school, the collective bargaining agreements between the 
District and its employees would not be applicable to the charter school, and “[j]ob 
applicants for positions may be considered through an open process, and, if hired, will enter 
into a contractual agreement with the Milestones Cooperative Charter School Director and 
Charter Council.” 
 

37. 

If and when Milestones Cooperative Charter School is established, 
respondents may apply for vacant positions; however, they cannot be guaranteed 
employment at the charter school, and their layoff from the District is completely separate 
and unrelated to any employment possibility at the charter school. 
 
Welfare of the District and Its Students 
 

38. 

The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the particular kinds of services 

identified in Resolutions No. 2010-08, 2010-09, and 2010-10, was not arbitrary or 
capricious, but constituted a proper exercise of discretion. 
 

39. 

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services is related to the 
welfare of the District and its pupils.  The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of 
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the District as 
determined by the Board. 
 

40. 

Except as previously noted, no certificated employee junior to any respondent 
was retained to perform any services which any respondent was certificated and competent to 
render. 
 
 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 

44955.  All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied. 

 

 

10

2. 

The anticipation of receiving less money from the state for the next school 

year is an appropriate basis for a reduction in services under Education Code section 44955.  
As stated in San Jose Teachers Association  v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 638-639, 
the reduction of particular kinds of services on the basis of financial considerations is 
authorized under that section, and, “in fact, when adverse financial circumstances dictate a 
reduction in certificated staff, section 44955 is the only statutory authority available to school 
districts to effectuate that reduction.”  The District must be solvent to provide educational 
services, and cost savings are necessary to resolve its financial crisis.  The Board’s decisions 
were a proper exercise of its discretion.  As set forth in Findings 32-33, respondents’ 
arguments to the contrary are without merit. 
 

3. 

The services identified in Resolutions No. 2010-08, 2010-09, and 2010-10, are 

particular kinds of services that could be reduced or discontinued under section Education 
Code section 44955.  Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees of the 
District due to the reduction or discontinuance of PKS.  Cause for the reduction or 
discontinuance of services relates solely to the welfare of the District’s schools and pupils 
within the meaning of Education Code section 44949. 
 

4. 

A District may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955, 

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not, 
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that 
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to 
deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 
178-179.) 
 

5. 

The notices sent to respondents indicated the statutory basis for the reduction of 

services and, therefore, were sufficiently detailed to provide them due process.  (San Jose 
Teachers Association v. Allen, supra, 144 Cal.App.3d 627; Santa Clara Federation of 
Teachers v. Governing Board (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831.)  The description of services to be 
reduced, both in the Resolutions and in the Notices, adequately describe particular kinds of 
services.  (Zalac v. Ferndale USD (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838; see also, Degener v. 
Governing Board (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 689.) 
 

6. 

As set forth in Findings 34-37, respondents did not establish that they should 
be retained by the District due to the possibility that a charter school may be established for 
the 2010-2011 school year. 
 

As set forth in Findings 25-31, respondents’ Motion to Dismiss is denied
