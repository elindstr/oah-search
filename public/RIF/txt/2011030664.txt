These services are “particular kinds of services” that may be reduced or

discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955. The Board’s decision to
reduce or discontinue these particular kinds of services was not arbitrary or capricious, but
constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

5.

The reduction or discontinuation of these particular kinds of services are
related to the welfare of the District and its pupils. The reduction or discontinuation of
particular kinds of services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees
of the District as determined by the Board. Respondents argued that because the number of
F.T.E. to be eliminated constituted approximately one-half of all F.T.E. in the District,
effectively “destroying the District in order to save it,” the Board’s actions were arbitrary and
capricious. Complainant responded that, over the next three years, the District was projected
to be $100,000,000 in debt, might not be able to meet its payroll next month and that the
Resolutions would allow the District flexibility, through the shifting of funds and other
measures, to be able to retain many of the F.T.E. proposed for layoff. The intent of the
Resolutions was also to avoid having the District placed in receivership, thereby losing “local
control.” In determining whether the decision of a school board is reasonable as
distinguished from fraudulent, arbitrary, or capricious, its action is measured by the standard
set by reason and reasonable people, bearing in mind that such a standard may permit a
difference of opinion on the same subject. (Campbell v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796,
808.) Reasonable minds can differ regarding the rationale and need for “flexibility” and for
retaining “local control” at the expense of laying off half of the District’s certificated

3

personnel. There was no evidence presented that Board acted in an arbitrary and capricious
manner, and in the absence of such evidence, the Board’s determination should not be
disturbed. (Ibid.)

6.

The Board properly considered all known attrition, resignations, retirements,

deaths and requests for transfer in determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices
to be delivered to its employees as of March 15, 2010. (San Jose Teachers Association v.
Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627 at 636 (1983).1

7.

The District created a seniority list (Exhibit 12), later revised (Exhibit 19),2

naming all probationary and permanent teachers in order of each one’s first date of paid
service. Respondents are certificated District employees. Except in one instance, no
certificated employee junior to any Respondent was retained to perform any services which
any Respondent was certificated and competent to render. That exception is with respect to
Respondent Robert Chase, a permanent teacher whose seniority date is August 26, 2008. Mr
Chase was skipped in favor of retaining Joshua Konegni, a probationary employee whose
seniority date is September 9, 2010. The District retained Mr. Konegni over Mr. Chase to
teach Visual and Performing Arts (drama). This decision was made based on Mr. Konegni’s
experience and expertise in teaching this subject and Mr. Chase’s lack of such experience.
Both teachers have the necessary credential (single subject, English) to teach drama.
However, Mr. Chase has never taught drama, has virtually no formal training in the subject
and has never taken courses in acting, directing or coaching drama. He has no experience in
teaching students to use regional dialects nor to teach or arrange “stage stunts.” His only
experience comes from his having had two non-speaking roles in “Diagnosis Murder” and
having performed in a number of plays and directing a film, all in the 1970’s. He does not
have a fine arts degree. Mr. Konegni, who has a fine arts degree, as well as an English
credential, has taught drama for three years. Although this is his first year with the District,
Mr. Konegni taught at the Los Angeles School for the Performing Arts until budget cuts
prompted his layoff last year. Mr. Konegni has extensive experience in theater and film
(Exhibits 16 and 17) and is a member of the Screen Actors’ Guild. He is proficient in and
teaches the use of the International Phonetic Alphabet, a system for transcribing the sounds
of speech which is independent of any particular language and applicable to all languages. It
is used in teaching the pronunciation of “regional dialects.” He has worked with student
actors from beginners through advanced, teaching them skills such as facial expression,
improvisation and puppetry. He also has training in teaching and performing stage stunts
and stage fighting techniques to avoid injury. This past year Mr. Konegni casted, produced
and directed a play at Morningside High School which had six performances and which
earned the school $4,000. Through his extensive contacts in the entertainment industry, this
past year Mr. Konegni has obtained monetary donations, stage props, accessories, and small
set pieces, valued at over $30,000, from sources such as Home Box Office.

1 All layoffs were for particular kinds of service, and not “average daily attendance” which might require positively
assured attrition to be considered through May 15, 2010.

2 The District revised the original seniority list to reflect changes made pursuant to stipulations placed on the record
at the hearing.

8.

In Code section 44955, subdivision (d), the Legislature has established four
justifications for school district’s skipping over a junior employee, not terminating him or
her, but terminating a more senior employee. That is, the Legislature has established four
justifications for deviating from terminating employees according to their seniority. The
justification applicable here is that a district may skip over a junior teacher and terminate a
senior teacher if “the district demonstrates a specific need for personnel to teach a specific
course or course of study . . . and that the certificated employee has special training and
experience necessary to teach that course or course of study or to provide those services, which
others with more seniority do not possess.” The District in this case is clearly justified in
skipping Mr. Konegni and terminating the services of Mr. Chase based on Mr. Konengni’s
demonstrated wealth of experience and expertise in teaching drama as opposed to Mr.
Chase’s very limited drama background.

Motion to Dismiss

Respondents filed a two-part Motion to Dismiss. Neither part is well taken and both

parts are denied. In the first part of the motion, Respondents point out that although the
Board determined it would eliminate 338 F.T.E, the District sent out layoff notices to 390
employees. Respondents moved to dismiss the Accusation as to the 52 employees over and
above the 338 “employees” whose dismissal was authorized. However, the Board did not
authorize a layoff of 338 employees, it authorized the reduction in force of 338 F.T.E. In
certain instances, several employees are grouped, based on the percentage of time spent
teaching a particular kind of service, into one F.T.E. As an example, a teacher may split his
or her time teaching English and Mathematics. Four-tenths of the time may be spent on
English. Three other teachers may each spend two-tenths of their time teaching English. If
one F.T.E. of English is eliminated, four teachers may be affected and thus each must be
given notice of possible layoff. Section 44955, subdivision (b), implicitly authorizes the
service of notice on more employees than F.T.E.’s sought to be reduced. That section
provides, in pertinent part:

. . . [W]henever a particular kind of service is to be reduced or discontinued
not later than the beginning of the following school year . . . and when in the
opinion of the governing board of the district it shall have become necessary by
reason of any of the [above specified] conditions to decrease the number of
permanent employees in the district, the governing board may terminate the
services of not more than a corresponding percentage of the certificated
employees of the district, permanent as well as probationary, at the close of the
school year. (Emphasis added)

The term “corresponding percentage” relates to the number of teachers actually

performing the particular kinds of services that are to be reduce or eliminated. Thus, if one
F.T.E. of English is to be reduced, and four teachers combined constitute one F.T.E., then the
corresponding percentage of teachers to that F.T.E. is the ratio of four to one, and those four

5

teachers must each be given notice. There was no “over-noticing,” and the District will not
eliminate more than 338 F.T.E.

Respondents also contend that three teachers received “precautionary notices” (Exhibit 4)

and the Accusation must be dismissed as to those three, because the Education Code does not
provide for the giving of such notices. These three teachers were given notice, as in all other
layoff notices, that their services would not be required for the following school year. However,
the precautionary notice goes on to specify that the teacher is being given the notice, not because
it is expected that he or she will not be retained, but rather that, because at the hearing there
might be challenges to the seniority list (such as the tie breaker criteria used), the order of
termination could change, the teacher could be affected thereby, and the teacher had a right to be
present and be heard with respect thereto. Nothing in the Education Code prohibits the common
practice of giving of precautionary notices. The precautionary notices do not, in any way, impair
the due process rights of the teachers receiving same. Rather, they protect those rights by
advising the teacher that issues raised by others might affect them, and giving them the
opportunity to respond.

Conclusions of Law

1.
44949 and 44955.

Jurisdiction for these proceedings exists pursuant to Education Code Sections

2.

The services set forth in Findings 2 and 3 are particular kinds of service which

may be reduced or discontinued in accordance with applicable statutes and case law. A
district may reduce services, within the meaning of Education Code Section 44955,
subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not,
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.)

3.

Cause exists because of the reduction in particular kinds of services to reduce

the District's teaching positions by 338 Full Time Equivalents and to give notice to the
affected teachers pursuant to Education Code Section 44955. (Campbell v. Abbot (1978) 76
Cal.App.3d 796; Degener v. Governing Board (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 689.)

4.

The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the services is neither arbitrary

nor capricious, but rather a proper exercise of its discretion. The Board’s decision to reduce or
discontinue the identified services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and was a proper exercise
of its discretion. The reduction or discontinuation of services relates solely to the welfare of the
District’s schools and pupils, within the meaning of Education Code section 44949.

5.

Except as set forth in Finding 7, no junior certificated employee is scheduled

to be retained to perform services which a more senior employee is certificated and
competent to render.

6

6.

A junior teacher may be given retention priority over senior teachers if the
junior teachers possess superior skills or capabilities which their more senior counterparts
lack (Poppers v. Tamalpais Union High School District (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 399; Santa
Clara Federation of Teachers v. Governing Board (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831), and the
District offered sufficient evidence that it had justification to skip Mr. Konegni and not retain
the more senior Mr. Chase.

As a result of the reductions of services, the District may give notice to all teachers

listed on Exhibit A that their services will not be required for the 2011/2012 school year.
