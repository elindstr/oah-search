On  March  14,  2005,  in  accordance  with  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 
44955,  the  Deputy  Superintendent  notified  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  (the  Board) 
and  Respondents  in  writing  of  the  Deputy  Superintendent’s  recommendation  that 
Respondents  be  notified  that  their  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  school  year. 
The  Deputy  Superintendent  stated  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation.  The 
recommendation  that  Respondents  be  terminated  from  employment  was  not  related  to  their 
competency  as  teachers. 

4. 

On  or  before  March  15,  2005,  a  notice  of  termination  was  delivered  to  each 
Respondent,  either  by  personal  delivery  or  by  depositing  the  notice  of  termination  in  the 
United  States  registered  mail,  postage  prepaid  and  addressed  to  the  Respondent’s  last  known’ 
address. 

The  written  notices  of  termination  specifically  stated  that  Respondents’  services 

would  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  year.  Each  notice  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the 
recommendation. 

Each  notice  advised  Respondents  of  their  right  to  a  hearing,  that  each  Respondent  had 
to  deliver  a  request  for  a  hearing  in  writing  to  the  person  sending  the  notice  of  termination  by 
April  4,  2005,  which  was  more  than  seven  days  after  the  notice  of  termination  was  served, 
and  that  the  failure  to  request  a  hearing  would  constitute  the  waiver  of  the  right  to  a  hearing. 

Each  appearing  Respondent  timely  filed  a  written  request  for  a  hearing  to 
determine  if  there  was  cause  for  not  reemploying  that  Respondent  for  the  ensuing  year. 

5. 

Accusations  were  timely  served  on  Respondents  thereafter.  Each  Respondent 

appearing  in  this  matter  filed  a  timely  Notice  of  Defense.  All  prehearing  jurisdictional 
requirements  were  met. 

The  Board  took  action  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  following  particular  kinds 

of  services  for  the  2005-2006  school  year:

Particular  Kind  of  Service

Full-Time  Equivalent 

Teacher-Kindergarten 
Teacher-Elementary  (grades  1-6) 
Teacher-Home  Economics 
Teacher-Physical  Education

Coordinator 

30  FTE 
16  FTE 
2  FTE 
3  FTE 
1  FTE 
1  FTE 
0.6  FTE 
1  FTE 

The  proposed  reductions  total  54.6  full-time  equivalent  (F TE)  positions.

8. 

The  services  were  “particular  kinds  of  services”  that  could  be  reduced  or 

discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955.  The  Board’s  decision  to 
reduce  or  discontinue  these  particular  kinds  of  services  was  not  arbitrary  or  capricious,  but 
constituted  a  proper  exercise  of  discretion. 

9. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  related  to  the 
welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils.  The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of 
services  was  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  as 
determined  by  the  Board. 

, 

10. 

The  Board  considered  all  known  attrition,  resignations,  retirements  and 
requests  for  transfer  in  determining  the  actual  number  of  necessary  layoff  notices  to  be 
delivered  to  its  employees. 

11. 

Nocertificated  employee  junior  to  any  Respondent  was  retained  to  perform 

any  services  which  any  Respondent  was  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

12. 

|  Much  of  the  language  in  this  Decision  is  couched  in  what  could  be  described 
as  “legalese.”  The  Decision  uses  legal  terms  such  as  “particular  kinds  of  service”  and  “full- 
time  equivalent.”  The  “legalese”  defines  a  comprehensive  body  of  law  that  can  be  as 
confusing  and  complex  as  the  terms  of  art  used  in  this  Decision.  However,  when  one  gets 
past  the  legalese,  this  case  revolves  around  a  set  of  questions  that  must  be  answered.  The 
questions  focus  on  trying  to  balance  two  conflicting  sets  of  needs  and  goals.  The  first  need  is 
that  of  the  School  District.  The  District  must  act  in  a  fiscally  prudent  fashion  and  risks  being 
placed  in  involuntary  receivership  should  it  fail  to  make  prudent  decisions  to  balance  its 
financial  books.  The  second  need  is  that  of  teachers,  generally  and  specifically, 
Respondents,  in  this  case.  Teachers  are  our  unsung  heroes  who  nurture,  challenge,  and 
stimulate  our  young  students.  They  deserve  the  full  protection  of  the  law  in  trying  to  retain 
their  hard-earned  employment. 

13. 

The  layoff  system  is  predicated  on  seniority.  That  means  quite  simply  that  the 

It  is  often,  lamentably,  the  most  energetic  and  best 
last  hired  generally  is  the  first  laid  off. 
trained  young  teacher  who  gets  the  pink  layoff  slip.  When  that  unfortunate  bit  of  bad  news 
must  be  delivered,  the  law  requires  that  such  an  affected  teacher  be  accorded  an  opportunity 
to  contest  the  decision.  The  law  also  requires  that  such  bad  news  be  delivered  by  a  date  that 
will  allow  such  a  teacher  the  maximum  opportunity  to  find  other  employment. 

14. 

The  laws,  both  statutory  and  decisional,  in  the  teacher  layoff  cases  demand 
that  a  school  district  strictly  comply  with  a  variety  of  notice  requirements  or  be  deemed  to 
have  involuntarily  rehired  the  teacher  in  question.  The  law  also  demands  that  the  school 
district  make  these  difficult  decisions  based  on  a  well  thought  out  and  clearly  articulated  set 
of  factors  that  all  relate  solely  to  the  well-being  of  the  students  of  the  district.  Teacher  layoff 
hearings  are  required  so  that  a  District  can  be  put  to  the  test  and  an  independent  judgment 
made  about  the  layoff  choices  it  proposes.  Sometimes  a  District  might  seek  to  use  the  layoff

  

process  to  punish  a  disfavored  teacher  or  reward  the  less  worthy. 
allow  an  affected  teacher  to  have  such  a  claim  heard  and  determined. 

These  hearings  exist  to 

15. 

In  this  case,  the  evidence  and  the  reasonable  inferences  that  flow  from  it, 

strongly  support  a  finding  that  the  Oceanside  Unified  School  District  has  acted  appropriately 
district 
and  with  due  caution  in  taking  the  steps  it  took.  Serious  financial  problems  face  the 
both  because  of  lessened  funding  from  the  Legislature  as  well  as  a  larger  than  anticipated 
reduction  in  the  number  of  students  in  the  District.  In  order  to  balance  the  budget, the 
District  thought  long  and  hard  about  where  and  how  much  to  cut.  None  of  the  scenarios 
were  terribly  appealing.  However,  the  layoffs  that  have  been  proposed  were  well  thought  out 
and  are  consistent  with  the  District’s  mandate  to  promote  the  welfare  of  the  District  and  its 
students.

Jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and

charges  set  forth  in  the  Accusation.  It  is  recommended  that  the  Board  give  Respondents 
notice  before  May  15,  2005,  that  their  services  will  no  longer  be  required  by  the  District.
