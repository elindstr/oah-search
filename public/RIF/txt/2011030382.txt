Director Schieferle thereafter provided written notice to the Governing Board
and to Respondents that he recommended the termination of Respondents’ services for the
2011-2012 school year due to the reduction of particular kinds of services.

5.

On March 8 through 11, 2011, the District provided notice to Respondents that
their services will not be required for the 2011-2012 school year due to the reduction of
particular kinds of services. Respondents filed timely requests for hearing.

6.

On or about March 23, 2011, the District filed and served the Accusation and
other required documents on Respondents. Respondents thereafter timely filed Notices of
Defense, seeking a determination of whether cause exists for not reemploying them for the
2011-2012 school year.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.

7.

8.

The services set forth in factual finding number 3 are particular kinds of services

which may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.2

9.

The Governing Board took action to reduce or discontinue the services set forth
in factual finding number 3 primarily because of the uncertainty surrounding future funding.
The decision to reduce the particular kinds of services is neither arbitrary nor capricious but is
rather a proper exercise of the District's discretion.

10.

The reduction of services set forth in factual finding number 3, in the context of
potential loss of State funding and the District’s needs to remain solvent to serve its students, is
related to the welfare of the District and its pupils, and it has become necessary to decrease the
number of certificated employees as determined by the Governing Board.

11.

In determining the number of final layoff notices to issue, the District expects to
take into account any retirements and resignations to reduce the number of actual layoff notices.

12.

On March 8, 2011, the Governing Board adopted criteria for breaking seniority
ties for employees with the same first date of paid service. Points were awarded for meeting the
following criteria: bilingual teaching certificates; credentials; “hard to hire credentials (science,
math, and special education); supplemental authorizations; and Master’s degrees. The tie-
breaking criteria are reasonable as they relate to the skills and qualifications of certificated
employees. Respondents did not challenge application of the criteria.

a.

13.

Respondent Lynda Catalano (Catalano) holds a single subject (art)
credential and teaches in Grades Kindergarten to Sixth. She started working for the District in
1978, and served as a substitute until 1987. Starting on September 3, 1987, Respondent
Catalano worked on a part-time basis teaching art, science, and intervention. Respondent
Catalano testified that she was able to set her own work schedule. In actuality, she worked three
days each week, Tuesdays, Wednesday, and Thursdays, a practice that was encouraged by her
site principal to better meet the needs of intervention students. In this schedule, Respondent
Catalano typically worked about 114 days, less than 75 percent of the days on the school year.
During the 2008-2009 school year, Respondent Catalano worked 111 out of 185 days of school,
or 60 percent of the instructional school year. Respondent Catalano started teaching on a full-
time basis during the 2009-2010 school year.

b.

The District has treated Respondent Catalano as a permanent employee
for an undetermined period. District evaluations completed at the end of the 2010-2011 school
year referred to her as a permanent employee. The seniority list submitted in evidence is
consistent with this treatment, as it showed her seniority date as September 3, 1987.

c.

In connection with record-review in the implementation of the 2011-2012
layoffs, Director Schieferle concluded that Respondent Catalano had been misclassified as a
that she was actually a
permanent employee. In March 2011, he informed Respondent
probationary employee in her second year. The District considers her proper seniority date
August 4, 2008, the date Respondent Catalano commenced her full-time employment.

14.

The District did not retain any certificated employee junior to Respondents to

render a service which Respondents are certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Jurisdiction for the subject proceeding exists pursuant to sections 44949 and

44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 7.

2.

The services listed in factual finding number 3 are determined to be particular
kinds of services within the meaning of section 44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 3
and 8.

3.

Cause exists under sections 44949 and 44955 for the reduction of the particular
kinds of services set forth in factual finding number 3, which cause relates solely to the welfare
of the District's schools and pupils, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 14.

4.

Respondent Catalano argues that she should not have been laid off because the
District assigned her the September 3, 1987, seniority date, which made her a permanent
employee and senior to retained certificated employees.

The doctrine of equitable estoppel is available in certain circumstances to those who
detrimentally rely on representations made by another. In order for equitable estoppel to apply,
the following requirements must be met: “(1) the party to be estopped must be apprised of the
facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon, or must so act that the party
asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended; (3) the other party must be
ignorant of the true facts; and (4) he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.” (Lentz v.
McMahon (1989) 49 Cal.3d 393, 399, quoting City of Long Beach v. Mansell (1970) 3 Cal.3d
462, 489.) Although the doctrine can be applied against the government “where justice and
right require it,” it cannot be applied against the government where to do so would effectively
nullify a “strong rule of policy, adopted for the benefit of the public . . . .” (City of Long Beach
v. Mansell, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 493.) Nor can estoppel be applied where to do so would
enlarge the power of a governmental agency or expand the authority of a public official.
(Longshore v. County of Ventura (1979) 25 Cal.3d 14, 28.)

Courts have refused to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel in teacher tenure cases
where the application would contravene statutory limitations. In Smith v. Governing Board of
Elk Grove Unified School District (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 563 (Elk Grove), a teacher retained
to work a third year sought classification as a permanent employee. The court declined to apply
equitable estoppel because the teacher’s two years of service had been under a provisional
credential and a statute prohibited counting such service toward tenure. (See, also, Fleice v.
Chualar Union Elementary School District (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 886.)

In this case, section 44918, subdivision (a), provides, in pertinent part, “Any employee
classified as a substitute or temporary employee, who serves during one school year for at least
75 percent of the number of days the regular schools of the district were maintained in that
school year and has performed the duties normally required of a certificated employee of the
school district, shall be deemed to have served a complete school year as a probationary
employee if employed as a probationary employee for the following school year. . . .” As set
forth in factual finding number 13, Respondent Catalano worked for less than 75 percent of the
time during the 2008-2009 school year, the year preceding her hiring in a probationary
capacity, and, as in the Elk Grove case, granting permanent status to Respondent Catalano
would contravene statutory limitations. Application of equitable estoppel in this case would
therefore impermissibly enlarge the District’s authority under the section 44918.

5.

Cause exists to terminate the services of Respondents, by reason of factual

finding numbers 1 through 13, and legal conclusion numbers 1 through 4.
