Superintendent  Smith  thereafter  notified  the  Governing  Board  that  he  had 
recommended  that  notice  be  provided  to  Respondents  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for 
the  2008-2009  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services. 

5. 

On  March  12,  2008,  the  District  provided  notice  to  Respondents  Brooks, 
Cooper,  Haverstock,  and  Lockwood,  and  on  March  14,  2008,  the  District  provided  notice  to 
Respondent  Mumford,  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year 
due  to  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services. 

6. 

Respondents  thereafter  requested  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for  not 

reemploying  them  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  All  hearing  requests  were  timely  filed. 

7. 

On  or  about  April  1,  2008,  the  District  issued  the  Accusation,  and  served  it  on 

Respondents.

9. 

Respondents  filed  timely  notices  of  defense. 

All prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met. 

10. 

The  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number 3  are  particular  kinds  of  services 

which  may  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955.' 

11. 

The  Governing  Board  took  action  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  services  set  forth 
in  factual  finding  number  3  primarily  because  of  the  uncertainty  surrounding  future  State 
funding.  The  decision  to  reduce  the  particular  kinds  of  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor 
capricious  but  is  rather  a  proper  exercise  of  the  District's  discretion. 

'  All  further  references  are  to  the  Education  Code.

  

    

12. 

The  reduction  of  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number 3  is  related  to  the 
welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of 
certificated  employees  as  determined  by  the  Governing  Board. 

13. 

The  District  retained  one  employee,  Stephanie  Schofield  (Schofield),  who  is 
junior  to  Respondents  Brooks,  Cooper,  Lockwood,  and  Mumford.  Schofield  has  a  credential 
that  authorizes  her  to  teach  special  education,  and  is  employed  to  provide  special  education 
services.  No  objection  was  raised  to  her  retention.  In  any  event,  retaining  Schofield  is 
appropriate  as  the  District  demonstrated  the  specific  need  for  her  services  and  she  has  the 
requisite  training  and  experience.

Respondent  Haverstock  was  first  hired  in  a  probationary  capacity  on  August  27, 

2007.  She  holds  a  preliminary  multiple  subject  credential.

Mumford  developed  and  staffed  the  District’s  community  day  school,  a  program  for  at-risk 
students.  The  District  anticipates  applying  for  continued  funding  for  the  program.

service  in  a  probationary  capacity,  August  24,  2006.  All  three  hold  preliminary  multiple  subject 
credentials,  and  Respondent  Cooper  also  holds  a  CLAD  certificate  and  an  authorization  in 
agriculture.  Respondent  Lockwood  has  a  Master’s  degree  and  additional  post-graduate  units. 
Respondent  Copper  is  working  on  obtaining  a  single  subject  credential  (science),  a  goal  she 
may  achieve  as  early  as  September  2008. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  to  any  Respondent  was  retained  to  render  a 

service  for  which  any  Respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS
