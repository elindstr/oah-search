FACTUAL FINDINGS

2. 

On February 16, 2010, the Governing Board of the District was given notice

3. 

On February 16, 2010, the Governing Board adopted Resolution #0910-40, 

entitled “Resolution of Intention to Dismiss Certificated Employees for Particular Kinds of 
Service and Average Daily Attendance” (Resolution).  Pursuant to the Resolution, the 
Governing Board determined that it was necessary for the District to reduce or discontinue 
certain particular kinds of services and to decrease certificated District employees no later 
than the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year.  The Governing Board also determined that 
the average daily attendance in all schools of the District for the first six months in which 
school was in session for the current 2009-2010 school year had declined below that of the 
corresponding period for the prior comparison school year. 
 

The Resolution identified the following services for reduction or

44955, that their services would not be required for the ensuing school year, and stating the 
reasons therefor (preliminary layoff notices). 
 

6. 

Pursuant to Education Code section 44949, respondents, in writing, duly 

requested a hearing to determine if there was cause for not reemploying them for the 2010-
2011 school year.

7. 

At the hearing on April 15, 2010, the District agreed to rescind the preliminary 

layoff notices served upon the following respondents: Ericka Clawson, Vanessa Lackey, 
Richard Looney, Andrea Marks, Kimberly Silvera, Rachael Smith, and Julie Ramirez. 
 

8. 

At the hearing, the parties agreed that the FTE’s of the remaining respondents 
will be reduced as set forth on Attachment A hereto, so long as the District sends final layoff 
notices to these respondents in accordance with Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. 
 

9. 

As part of the stipulation between the parties, respondent Michael Catanzarite 

agrees that he will submit to the District a letter from his college, National University, 
certifying that his coursework for his Level II Education Specialist credential has been 
completed. 
 

The District agrees to submit the letter to the Nevada County Superintendent of 
Schools (NCSOS), along with the District’s agreement that a temporary certificate be issued 
as soon as possible.  As soon as NCSOS issues the temporary certificate, the District agrees 
to return Mr. Catanzarite to the classroom. 
 

10. 

The District further agrees that all respondents who are probationary 

employees for the 2009-2010 school year shall have the 24-month rehire rights provided for 
in Education Code section 44957 extended for an additional nine months, for a total of 33 
months. 
 

In addition, all respondents who are permanent employees for the 2009-2010 school 

year shall have the 39-month rehire rights provided for in Education Code section 44956 
extended for an additional nine months, for a total of 48 months. 
 

This extension of rehire rights applies only to respondents terminated at the end of the 
2009-2010 school year, and is not applicable to any future reduction in force that may occur. 
 
 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Cause exists within the meaning of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 
for not reemploying certain identified respondents for the 2010-2011 school year because the 
Governing Board of the District has determined to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of 
service, and the average daily attendance in all schools of the District for the first six months 
in which school was in session for the current 2009-2010 school year has declined below that 
of the corresponding period for the prior comparison school year. 
 

2. 

Cause exists to give notice to the respondents identified on Attachment A that 
their services will be reduced or will not be required for the 2010-2011 school year because 
of the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services and the decline in average daily 
attendance.
