FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1.    

James Franco is the Superintendent of the Tracy Unified School District.  His 

actions were taken in his official capacity. 
 

2. 

Before March 9, 2010, the Superintendent determined that funding for the 

2010-2011 school year would be reduced, thereby necessitating the reduction or elimination 
of certain particular kinds of services.  The Superintendent recommended to the Board that 
certain particular kinds of services be reduced or eliminated, affecting employees occupying 
151.7 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions.  The Superintendent’s resolution to eliminate and 
reduce teaching services was made solely for the welfare of students. 
 

3. 

On March 9, 2010, the Board adopted Resolution No. 09-23, providing for the 
reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services, resulting in reduction or elimination 
of 149.3 certificated positions. 
 

4. 

On March 12, 2010, the Superintendent served on persons affected by the 

reduction and elimination of particular kinds of services a “Recommendation That Services 
Will Not Be Required” for the ensuing school year, 2010–2011 (Layoff Notice or Notice).  
The Notice stated that the Superintendent had recommended to the Board that notice be 
given to respondents pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, that their 
services would not be required for the ensuing school year.  The Notice advised that the 
Board had passed a Resolution reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services which 
reduced the certificated staff, and enclosed a copy of the Resolution, identifying the 
particular kinds of services to be reduced or eliminated. 
 

5. 

On March 30, 2010, the Board adopted Resolution No. 09-29, which directed 
the Superintendent, or his representatives, to rescind multiple Notices due to a reduction in 
the number of particular kinds of services the Board had initially identified for reduction or 
elimination.  The District complied with this resolution and rescinded certain Notices. 
 

6. 

Respondents timely requested a hearing to determine if there is cause for not 

re-employing them for the ensuing school year. 
 

7. 

The Superintendent made and filed Accusations against each of the employees 

who requested a hearing.  The Accusations with required accompanying documents and 
blank Notices of Defense were timely served on those employees.

8. 

Respondents timely filed Notices of Defense to the Accusations. 

9. 

At hearing, the District and respondents (except Anthony Crivello, Holly 

 
 
Sowers, Doreen Bolding and Judith Kent-Fabris) entered into the Stipulation attached hereto.  
The Stipulation provides that Layoff Notices issued to certain respondents identified in the 
Stipulation, (including Anthony Crivello and Holly Sowers) are rescinded or are partially 
rescinded. 
 
 
 

The Stipulation rescinds the Layoff Notices issued to the following employees:

The Stipulation partially rescinds the Layoff Notices issued to the following

employees:

AFAN, KRISTINA

HUNTER, JOHN

ODOKO, BOLANOLE 
.2 FTE Rescission 
RIVAS, MARIA                   .4 FTE Rescission 

12. 

In light of the defaults of Lisa Coffman, Rochelle Gumpert and Amber Holder, 

and the agreements reached in the Stipulation, the only respondents who remain in this 
proceeding are Doreen Bolding and Judith Kent-Fabris.  Doreen Bolding is a permanent 
certificated employee, with a seniority date of August 2, 2005.  She holds a multiple subject

teaching credential and presently teaches eighth grade at the Monte Vista School.  Ms. 
Bolding did not present a defense to her layoff. 
 

13. 

Judith Kent-Fabris received a Notice of Layoff as a precautionary measure, as 

the District regards her as a temporary employee.  On August 7, 2009, Ms. Kent-Fabris 
accepted and signed an “Offer of Temporary Employment” with the District.  Pursuant to the 
offer, the “duration” of employment was identified as “August 10, 2009, to not exceed May 
27, 2010.”  Ms. Kent-Fabris testified that she had some concerns about whether she was 
indeed a temporary employee.  However, she did not produce evidence to support her 
position.

The anticipation of receiving less money from the state for the next school

year is an appropriate basis for a reduction in services under section 44955.  As stated in San 
Jose Teachers Assn v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 638-639, the reduction of particular 
kinds of services on the basis of financial considerations is authorized under that section, 
and, “in fact, when adverse financial circumstances dictate a reduction in certificated staff, 
section 44955 is the only statutory authority available to school districts to effectuate that 
reduction.”  The District must be solvent to provide educational services and cost savings are 
necessary to resolve its financial crisis.  The Superintendent’s decision to reduce particular 
kinds of services was a proper exercise of his discretion. 
 
 
The services identified in Board Resolution No. 09-23, are particular kinds of 
services that could be reduced or discontinued under Education Code section 44955.  Cause 
exists to reduce the number of certificated employees of the District due to the reduction and 
discontinuation of particular kinds of services.  Cause for the reduction or discontinuation of 
services relates solely to the welfare of the County’s schools and pupils within the meaning of 
section 44949.

thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that

As set forth in Finding 13, Judith Kent-Fabris is a temporary employee; 

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 to provide final 

reduced, both in the Board’s Resolution and in the Notices, adequately describe particular 
kinds of services.  (Zalac v. Ferndale USD (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838.  See, also, Degener v. 
Governing Board (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 689.) 
 
 
Notice to respondent Doreen Bolding that her services will not be required in the ensuing 
school year.   
 
 
consequently, she is not entitled to the protections of Education Code sections 44949 and 
44955.  The District issued her a Notice of Layoff as a precaution, in the event she 
established that she was a probationary or permanent employee.   The District need not 
provide Final Notice to Ms. Kent-Fabris that her services will not be required in the ensuing 
school year.  As Ms. Kent-Fabris is not represented by counsel in this proceeding, the 
District may choose, as a precautionary measure or as a courtesy, to provide Ms. Kent-Fabris 
with a Final Notice that her services will not be required in the ensuing school year.  Should 
the District choose to provide said Final Notice, the District’s action shall not be deemed to 
be a waiver of its position that Ms. Kent-Fabris is a temporary employee.  Nor shall the 
District’s action in providing a Final Notice affect Ms. Kent-Fabris’s status as a temporary 
employee. 
 
 

ORDER

be required for the 2010-2011 school year, because of the reduction and discontinuance of
