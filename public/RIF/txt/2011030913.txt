SUMMARY OF PROPOSED DECISION

The Board of Education of the Hemet Unified School District determined to reduce or

discontinue particular kinds of services provided by teachers for budgetary reasons. The

1

The record remained open for receipt of briefs from the Deputy Superintendent and

the Respondents who are administrators. On April 19, 2011, the Deputy Superintendent filed
Memorandum of Points and Authorities Re Education Code section 44951 (Exhibit 21).
Respondents Ellen Burgess, Megan Haley and Paul Kankowski filed Administrative
Respondents’ Brief on April 22, 2011, and it was marked Exhibit 22. On April 24, 2011, the
Deputy Superintendent filed her Reply Brief, and it was marked Exhibit 23.

On April 24, 2011, the record was closed, and the matter was submitted.

decision was not related to the competency and/or dedication of the individuals whose
services are proposed to be reduced or eliminated.

District staff carried out the Board’s decision by using a selection process involving

review of credentials and seniority, “bumping,” competency and breaking ties
between/among employees with the same first dates of paid service. The selection process
was in accordance with the requirements of the Education Code.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Respondents listed in Exhibit “A” (Respondents) are certificated employees of

the Hemet Unified School District (District).

2.

On February 15, 2011, the District’s Governing Board (Board) took action to
reduce or eliminate particular kinds of certificated services and adopted competency criteria
“for the purposes of bumping and reemployment”, commencing the 2011-2012 school year;
on January 18, 2011, the Board adopted criteria for resolving ties in seniority; on April 12,
2011, the Board amended the District’s competency criteria.

3.

On March 10, 2011, Dr. Steven Lowder, the Superintendent (Superintendent)

designated LaFaye Platter, Ed.D., Deputy Superintendent - Human Resources (Deputy
Superintendent), to act on his behalf in the certificated layoff proceeding, commenced by
Board action on February 15, 2011.

4.

No later than March 15, 2011, the Deputy Superintendent served Respondents

with written notice that it had been recommended not to re-employ them in the 2011-2012
school year. The notice stated the reasons for the recommendation. In addition, the notice
advised Respondents of the right to hearing, that the request for hearing must be delivered to
the District’s office no later than March 24, 2011, and that the failure to request a hearing
would constitute waiver of the right to a hearing.

5.

No later than March 15, 2011, the Deputy Superintendent served notice on
permanent, probationary and temporary employees. In the notice, she stated, in pertinent
part:

Inclusion of categorically funded services is not intended to
grant those individuals who are impacted any rights greater than
provided by law, nor to nullify any provisions within each
impacted individual’s employment contract, nor to supersede
any other Resolution by this Governing Board to release or
otherwise terminate the services of any impacted individual.

6.

The Deputy Superintendent made and filed an Accusation for lay-off of

certificated employees. She served each individual who submitted a Request for Hearing
with an Accusation, form for a Notice of Defense, Notice of Hearing and related materials.

Respondents submitted a Notice of Defense. Some employees did not file a timely

Request for Hearing and/or Notice of Defense.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements were satisfied.

Prior to conclusion of the hearing, the District rescinded layoff notices issued

to Respondents Toni Hunter, Frances Pratt, Mary Mikolayoik and Pamela Alvarado.

The District employs certificated teachers under Education Code section

44909 (categorical programs) and has released these temporary teachers.

10.

On February 15, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2046B taking action

to reduce or eliminate the following particular kinds of certificated services, commencing
2011-2012 school year as follows:

The proposed reductions totaled 85.93 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions.

11.

The District’s Deputy Superintendent was responsible for implementing the

technical aspects of the layoff. She developed a seniority list for probationary and permanent
certificated employees who received preliminary notice of layoff. It included, among other
matters, the teacher’s name, seniority date, tie-breaker number (if applicable), status, site,
assignment (subject/grade) and credential(s).

The seniority date was based on the first date of paid service rendered in a

probationary position.3 A teacher hired as a probationary employee who worked as a
substitute or temporary employee for at least 75 percent of the school days during the
previous year and who had performed the duties normally required of a certificated employee
of the District was deemed to have served a complete school year as a probationary
employee if that individual was employed as a probationary employee the following school
year. The individual was entitled to have that earlier year counted as a year of probationary
service. The prior year was “tacked” on for seniority purposes but only one year could be
tacked. 4

12.

The District used the seniority list to develop a proposed order of layoff list to

determine the least senior employees currently assigned in the various services being
reduced. Then, the District determined whether those employees held credentials in another
area that would entitle them to “bump” other junior employees. In determining who would
be laid off for each kind of service reduced, the District counted the number of reductions
and determined the impact on incumbent staff in inverse order of seniority. Then, the
District checked the credentials of affected individuals and whether they could “bump” other

3

4

Education Code section 44845

Education Code section 44918

employees, considering the District’s “competency” criteria established by the Board in its
resolution, which states, in pertinent part:

…. (1) possession of a valid credential in the relevant subject
matter area; (2) “highly qualified” status under the No Child
Left Behind Act in the position into which the employee is
bumping/being reemployed; (3) an appropriate EL authorization
(if required by the position); (4) at least one (1) year of
experience in the position or assignment within the last five (5)
years; and (5) special training and experience necessary to meet
the job requirements of positions containing specialized
assignments (such as Athletic Directors, Activities Directors,
Teachers on Special Assignment, AVID teachers, AdvancePath
Academy teachers and Academic Coaches).

On April 12, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2058 (Resolution Authorizing District
Staff to Strike Competency Requirement D, Item 4 from Resolution 2046B) and removed
competency criterion (4) “at least one (1) year of experience in the position or assignment
within the last five (5) years.”

13.

Some employees named as Respondents have the same seniority date. In

compliance with Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), in order to determine the
order of termination of employees with the same seniority date, in Resolution No. 2038,
dated January 18, 2011, the Board adopted “Resolution To Adopt Criteria For Resolving
Ties In Seniority Related to Certificated Layoffs.” According to the evidence in the record,
the District properly applied this tie breaker criteria to rank employees hired on the same
date; under these criteria the District properly retained certain employees while Respondents
were properly given notice that their services would no longer be required for the ensuing
school year.

14.

Respondents Janel Ramirez (Respondent Ramirez), Casie Husby (Respondent

Husby) and Hugo Gorosave (Respondent Gorosave) assert that they were improperly
identified for layoff. Each testified regarding the specific reasons. However, none of these
Respondents identified a person more junior who is being retained to perform a service
she/he is certificated and competent to perform. None of these Respondents established that
the District abused its discretion or otherwise acted arbitrarily in issuing a layoff notice to
her/him. Insufficient evidence was offered to establish that Respondents Ramirez, Husby
and Gorosave were improperly identified for layoff.

15.

Respondent Matthew Pailes (Respondent Pailes) contends that employees who

are junior to him are being retained to perform services he is credentialed and competent to
perform.

Respondent Pailes’ seniority date is March 5, 2007. During second semester, he

taught at Hemet Academy for Applied Academics and Technology (HAAAT); according to

the District’s seniority list, under credential, it states “Multiple Subject (exam) SB2042” and
assignment “1-Computer Lab, 1-Algebra, 1-Math, 2-English and 1-PE;” he testified that the
seniority list was erroneous in that he is no longer teaching Computer Lab or Algebra but is
teaching World History; he stopped teaching Computer Lab at the semester break,
presumably after first semester.

Respondent Pailes argued that he is credentialed and competent to teach Language
Arts, a service Emily Hulstrom, a more junior employee is being retained to perform. He
does not hold a credential to teach English; he testified that since HAAAT is a charter
school, “it is not necessary to have a credential in any subject that is not written into the
charter as being necessary to teach that subject.” He has 17 units in English and asserts that
this would entitle him to a board waiver or authorization. He offered no documentary
evidence to support his testimony about the contents of the school charter or to establish that
he has a board waiver or authorization to teach language arts or that he is credentialed to do
so.

Darlene Marcus (Marcus) bumped .2 Computer Lab of Respondent Pailes position.

Her seniority date is August 21, 2002; regarding her credential and assignment, the seniority
list states “Single Subject (Health Science) Ltd. Assign, PE, CLAD.” No evidence was
offered to establish that she is credentialed to teach Computer Lab. Further, the Deputy
Superintendent testified that the District considered second semester assignments (those
identified prior to March 15, 2011) in determining bumping in the layoff. The District
offered no evidence to rebut Respondent Pailes’ testimony that he was not assigned to teach
computer lab during second semester.5 Given the foregoing, the District improperly allowed
Marcus to bump .2 Computer Lab of Respondent Pailes position. If the District retains
Darlene Marcus to perform this service, Respondent Pailes is entitled to retention for .2 FTE.

16.

Respondents Ellen Burgess (Respondent Burgess), Megan Haley (Respondent
Haley)6 and Paul Kankowsi (Respondent Kankowski) are assigned to provide administrative
services (principal and assistant principal) for the District for the 2010-2011 school year.
They argue that because they did not receive a written notice of release and reassignment
pursuant to Education Code section 44951, they are not subject to the present layoff pursuant
to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.

On February 15, 2011, separate from Resolution No. 2046B (Finding 10), in closed

session, the District’s Governing Board adopted Resolution No. 2058 and thereby took action

5

6

The Deputy Superintendent testified that determinations regarding which certificated

staff to layoff were based on second semester assignments.

For the 2010 – 2011 school year, the District employed Respondent to perform .50

assistant principal duties and .50 teaching third grade students (described as non-instructional
duties). Respondent Haley challenges her layoff only as to the administrative services that
she provided; she does not challenge the layoff based on her assignment to perform non-
instructional duties.

“to release” certain “administrative employees from their positions and reassign them to the
classroom pursuant to Education Code section 44951, effective at the end of the 2010-2011
school year and directed the Superintendent or designee to send appropriate legal notices to
them”. Based on the employee numbers identified in this resolution, Respondents Burgess,
Haley and Kankowski were among the administrators so identified.

Prior to March 15, 2011, the Deputy Superintendent orally advised Respondents

Burgess, Haley and Kankowski that he/she was being released from his/her administrative
duties for the 2011/2012 school year. In addition, prior to March 15, 2011, the District
served these Respondents with written Notice of Recommendation that Services will not be
Required, the Reduction of Particular Kinds of Certificated Services (Resolution No. 2046B),
the Notice of Accusation and the other documents served on certificated teachers.
Respondents Burgess, Haley and Kankowski filed timely Requests for Hearing and Notices
of Defense.

The “March 15 preliminary notice” served on these Respondents recommended a

reduction or discontinuance of a particular kind of service but did not designate a category of
services that applied to Respondents Burgess, Haley and Kankowski’s administrative
assignments as principals and assistant principals. Respondents testified that when they
reviewed their preliminary notice of layoff and accusation, they did not think it applied to
them because their administrative services were not identified in the particular kinds of
services. They testified that they were confused as to why their services were not listed and
what the notice actually meant.

The District identified Respondents as subject to the particular kind of services layoff

under “Elementary (K-5) Classroom Teaching Services.” Respondents Burgess, Haley and
Kankowsi’s current assignments are administrative services (principal and assistant
principal), not classroom teaching services.

The parties stipulated and agreed to the accuracy of the seniority date for each of

these Respondents (Exhibit 13) and placement within the layoff as reflected in the District’s
bump analysis (Exhibit 16).

17.

Education Code section 44951 describes the procedure that the District must

follow in order to release an administrator from a position that requires an administrative
credential; the statute does not entitle the administrator to a hearing regarding this release and
reassignment. An administrator attains no tenure and serves at the pleasure of the appointing
power. (Hentschke v. Sink (1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 19, 22.)

The Board authorized the District to release and reassign certain administrators to the

classroom, including Respondents Burgess, Haley and Kankowski. The evidence will not
support a determination that the District followed this procedure required by Education Code
section 44951. These Respondents did not receive written notice of the release and
reassignment to the classroom pursuant to Education Code section 44951 by March 15.
Without reassigning Respondents Burgess, Haley and Kankowski to the classroom for the

2011 – 2012 school year, the District laid these Respondents off under the category
“Elementary K-5 teaching positions”. The District did not establish that these Respondents
may be laid off for a reduction in elementary classroom teaching services based on their
possession of credentials authorizing them to provide those services, regardless of
assignment.

Given the facts in the Findings 15 and 16, pursuant to Education Code section 44955,
subdivision (c), Respondents Burgess, Haley and Kankowski are entitled to be re-employed
as administrators for the 2011 – 2012 school year.

18.

The services that the District proposed to reduce were “particular kinds of

services” that can be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section
44955. The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue these particular kinds of services was
not arbitrary or capricious but constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

19.

The District’s reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services related to

the welfare of the District and its pupils. The reduction or elimination of particular kinds of
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the District as
determined by the Board.

20.

No certificated employee junior to any Respondent has been retained to

perform services that any Respondent was certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 and

44955. All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in these sections are satisfied.

A District may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not,
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford vs. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.)

3.

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the District

to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services. The cause for the reduction or
discontinuance of particular kinds of services is related solely to the welfare of the schools
and the pupils thereof.

4.

As reflected in case law, categorically funded teachers are treated like

temporary employees. (Zalac v. Ferndale Unified School District (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838,
840-841 [A kindergarten teacher’s first two years of employment was as a temporary
employee in a categorically funded program pursuant to Education Code section 44909].) In

Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v. Bakersfield City School District (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 1260, the Court of Appeal found that teachers in categorically funded positions
“are treated in much the same way [as temporary employees] in that they may be dismissed
without the formalities required for probationary and permanent employees in the event the
program expires or is terminated, and their service does not count toward acquiring
permanent status (unless they are reemployed the following year in a probationary position).”
Here, there is no evidence that the categorical programs have expired. However, the
Bakersfield Court, citing Zalac, noted the purpose of Education Code section 44909 was “‘to
prevent a person from acquiring probationary status solely through teaching in a
categorically funded program. This permits the hiring of qualified persons for categorically
funded programs of undetermined duration without incurring responsibility to grant tenured
status based on such teaching services alone.’ [Citation.] The section ‘was intended to give
school districts flexibility in the operation of special educational programs to supplement
their regular program and to relieve them from having a surplus of probationary or
permanent teachers when project funds are terminated or cut back.’ [Citation.]” (Bakersfield
Elementary Teachers Association v. Bakersfield City School District, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th
1260, 1286.) To characterize categorically funded Respondents as probationary employees
would be contrary to that purpose. (See also Haase v. San Diego Community College
District (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 913 [for additional support through analysis of a certificated
employee in a categorically funded position in a community college district not found to be a
probationary employee].)

5.

Furthermore, in Education Code section 44909, the Legislature directed

categorically funded employees who replace other teachers to be subject to the provisions of
Education Code section 44918, but “without regard to other requirements of this code
respecting the termination of probationary or permanent employees.” This direction provides
further support for the conclusion reached here, that categorically funded employees are
treated as temporary employees.

6.

Thus, in this case, the Respondents in categorically funded programs are

temporary employees. The District may dismiss them in the manner the law allows
regarding temporary employees. It is noted that the District served these Respondents with
the jurisdictional documents and provided them the opportunity to participate in the instant
hearing. These Respondents participated in the hearing to the fullest extent possible, as if
probationary employees. Had the administrative law judge concluded that categorically
funded Respondents were probationary, they would have been entitled to the hearing that
was had and in which they participated.

7.

A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a
continuing position that he/she is certificated and competent to fill. In doing so, the senior
employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that position. (Lacy vs.
Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal. 3d 469.)

8.

The District has the discretion to determine whether teachers are certificated
and competent to hold the position for which said teachers have been skipped and retained.

(King v. Berkeley Unified School District (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 1016) Junior teachers may
be given retention priority over senior teachers if the junior teachers possess superior skills or
capabilities that their more senior counterparts lack. (Poppers v. Tamalpais Union High
School District (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 399; Santa Clara Federation of Teachers, Local 2393
v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified School District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831).

9.

The District established cause to not reemploy Respondents for the ensuing

school year and Respondents did not establish facts or sufficient legal argument to the
contrary.

11.

No employee with less seniority than any Respondent is being retained to

perform a service that any Respondent is certificated and competent to render.

12.
therefore rejected.

All arguments not addressed herein are not supported by the evidence and

ORDER

1.

2.

3.

3.

The Accusation against Respondents Toni Hunter, Frances Pratt and Mary

Mikolayoik is dismissed.

If Darlene Marcus is retained to perform .2 FTE Computer Science,

Respondent Matthew Pailes is entitled to be retained .2 FTE.

The Accusation against Respondents Ellen Burgess, Megan Haley and Paul

Kankowski is dismissed.

Except as provided in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Order, the Accusation

served on Respondents listed on Amended Exhibit “A” is sustained. Notice shall be given to
these Respondents before May 15, 2011 that their services will not be required for the 2011-
2012 school year because of the reduction or discontinuance of particular kinds of services.
