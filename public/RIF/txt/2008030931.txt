The  resolution  directed  the  district’s  superintendent,  or  her  designee,  to  initiate 

procedures  to  not  reemploy  the  equivalent  of  12.01  full-time  equivalent  certificated 
employees  of  the  district  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955. 

2. 

On  March  13,  2008,  District  Superintendent  Dena  McCullough  sent  notice  to 

16  certificated  employees  of  her  recommendation  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or 
discontinued  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  Four  of  those  employees  requested  a  hearing  to 
determine  if  there  was  cause  to  not  re-employ  them.  One  of  the  employees  withdrew  her 
request  for  a  hearing  and  the  accusation  against  her  was  withdrawn.  Three  employees  —  Lisa 
Cardenas,  Adriana  Contreras,  and  Jennifer  Nichols  —  are  the  remaining  respondents  in  this 
proceeding. 

3. 

The  parties  stipulated  that  the  district  has  complied  with  all  procedural 

requirements  of  Education  Code  section  44949  and  44955. 

4. 

The  board’s  decision  to  reduce  12.01  full-time  equivalent  positions  was  based 

on  a  combination  of  declining  enrollment  and  an  anticipated  loss  of  revenue  of  $880,000 
from  the  State  of  California  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

5. 

In  determining  which  certificated  employees  were  to  be  given  notice,  the 
district  gave  notice  in  reverse  order  of  seniority.  There  were  no  teachers  with  the  same 
seniority  date,  and  thus  there  was  no  application  of  tie-breaking  criteria.  Two  employees 
were  skipped;  one  is  currently  assigned  to  an  administrative  position,  and  one  is  a  speech 
therapist. 

6. 

Respondents  are  full-time  permanent  employees  of  the  district.  Each 

respondent  is  an  elementary  classroom  teacher  at  Morris  School.  For  the  2007-2008  school 
year,  they  were  each  assigned  to  teach  in  a  Spanish  immersion  classroom. 

7. 

No  respondent  is  certificated  or  competent  to  be  a  speech  therapist.  No 

certificated  employee  junior 
perform  services  that  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

in  seniority  to  respondents  is  being  retained  by  the  district  to 

8. 

Respondents  strongly  believe  in  the  efficacy  of  the  district’s  Spanish 

immersion  program,  and  based  on  the  projected  numbers  of  students  entering  the  district  and 
remaining  in  the  district,  they  believe  that  the  district  will  not  be  able  to  properly  staff  the 
program  if  they  are  non-reemployed. 

The  board  has  not  decided  if  it  will  continue  to  participate  in  the  classroom  reduction 

program  for  2008-2009  school  year.  The  district’s  budget  advisory  committee  has 
recommended  to  the  board  that  the  district  continue  to  participate  in  the  class  size  reduction 
program.  The  board  has  not  yet  acted  on  that  recommendation. 

If  the  board  elects  to  discontinue  participating  in  the  class  size  reduction  program,  the 

district  will  restructure  the  Spanish  immersion  program  at  Morris  School  utilizing  its 

‘

remaining  teachers.  If  the  board  elects  to  continue  to  participate  in  the  class  size  reduction 
program,  the  district  will  need  additional  teachers  and  will  re-hire  respondents  in  seniority 
order. 

The  decision  to  reduce  particular  kinds  of  services  is  a  matter  within  the  discretion  of 

the  board.  In  light  of  the  financial  uncertainties  facing  the  district,  the  board  acted  in  an 
attempt  to  allow  for  maximum  flexibility  in  determining  staffing  needs  for  the  ensuing 
school  year  in  view  of  its  available  resources  and  the  needs  of  its  students.  As  such,  it  has 
not  been  shown  that  the  board’s  decision  was  either  arbitrary  or  capricious.  (Campbell 
Elementary  Teachers  Assn.,  Inc.  v.  Abbott  (1978)  76  Cal.App.3d  796,  808.) 

9. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation of  particular  kinds  of  services  is  related  to  the 

welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  for  this  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections 

44949  and  44955,  and  all  notices  and  other  requirements  of  those  sections  have  been 
provided  as  required  by  law.

2. 

Cause  exists  because  of  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services  pursuant 

to  Education  Code  section  44955  to  give  notice  to  respondents  Lisa  Cardenas,  Adriana 
Contreras,  and  Jennifer  Nichols,  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009 
school  year.  The  cause  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  its  pupils  within  the 
meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949. 

ORDER 

Notice  may  be  given  to  Lisa  Cardenas,  Adriana  Contreras,  and  Jennifer  Nichols  that 
their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  of 
particular  kinds  of  services.
