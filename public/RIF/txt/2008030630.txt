one  or  more  of  the  particular  kinds  of  services  which  are  to  be  reduced  or  eliminated. 
Respondents’  positions  will  be  terminated  as  a  result  of  the  foregoing  decisions.

J. 

As  a  result  of  the  foregoing,  2.0  FTE  of  respondents’  services  as 

certificated  employees  will  be  terminated. 

Cause  for  termination  of  2.0  FTE  employment  of  respondents  relates 

solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof  within  the  meaning  of 
Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955. 

2. 

The  parties  further  stipulated  as  follows: 

A. 

With  respect  to  Resolution  07-44,  the  following  employees  have 

seniority  dates  as  set  forth  below: 

Richard  Rocero  —  November  8,  1988; 
Michael  Yonan  —  November  1,  1996; 
Robert  Sanguino  ~  August  24,  1998. 

B. 

As  a  consequence  of  the  above-stipulated  seniority  dates,  the  District 
no  longer  proposes  to  eliminate  1.0  FTE  Automotive  Teaching  Program  (Item  a.  on 
Resolution  07-44),  thereby  reducing  the  particular  kinds of  services  to  be  decreased  to 
93.0  FTE,  and  resulting  in  the  termination  of  2.0  FTE  certificated  employees 
(respondents  herein). 

Cc. 

Respondent  Angelo  and  Respondent  Hurtado  are  the  two  least  senior 

certificated  employees  of  the  District  in  services  being  reduced  pursuant  to  Resolution 
07-44  (Spanish  —  respondent  Hurtado;  Physical  Education  —  respondent  Angelo). 

3. 

Counsel  for  the  District  represented  that,  with  respect  to  the  20.0  FTE 

Secondary  Counseling  Program,  as  set  forth  in 
Elementary  Counseling  Program  and  5.0  I 
Board  Resolutions  07-44  and  07-43,  the  District  has  withdrawn  all  March  13,  2008  counselor 
notification  letters  related  to  these  resolutions,  and  the  counselors  so  notified  are  being 
retained  by  the  District. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS
