SUMMARY OF PROPOSED DECISION

The Board of Education of the Grossmont Union High School District determined to

reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services provided by teachers for budgetary reasons.
The decision was not related to the competency and/or dedication of the individuals whose
services the Board seeks to reduce or eliminate.

District staff carried out the Board’s decision by using a selection process involving

review of credentials and seniority, “bumping” and breaking ties between/among employees
with the same first date of paid service. The selection process was in accordance with the
requirements of the Education Code.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Respondents listed in Exhibit “A” (Respondents) are certificated employees of

the Grossmont Union High School District (District).

2.

On March 7, 2012, Ralf Swenson, the District’s Superintendent
(Superintendent), notified the District’s Governing Board (Board) of his recommendation to
reduce and/or eliminate particular kinds of services due to financial conditions for the 2012 -
2013 school year.

3.

On March 7, 2012, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2012-44 reducing or

eliminating particular kinds of services for the ensuing school year and establishing
“competency” criteria for purposes of displacement. In a separate resolution, the Board
adopted criteria for breaking ties in seniority related to the certificated layoffs. The Board
directed the Superintendent or his designated representative to send notices to all employees
possibly affected by the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services.

 Exhibit 30 (Organizes information regarding permanent and

probationary certificated district employees at least partially assigned to a
categorical program or project by subject areas in which these Employees are
competent and credentialed to teach or otherwise render service. Also, Exhibit 30
consolidates the information with information regarding temporary employees in
categorical programs during the 2011-2012 school year (contained in Exhibit 23).

Pursuant to the Stipulation of Parties, Exhibits 29 and 30 are admitted into evidence.

On April 18, 2012, the District’s Closing Brief was filed (Exhibit 31). Respondents’
Closing Brief was filed on April 20, 2012 (Exhibit 32). On April 23, 2012, District’s Reply
to Respondents’ Closing Brief was filed on April 23, 2012 (Exhibit 33).

On April 23, 2012, the record was closed, and the matter was submitted.

*Inclusion of categorically funded services within this Resolution is not
intended to grant those individuals who are impacted any rights greater
than provided by law, nor to nullify any provisions within each
impacted individual's employment contract, nor to supersede any other
Resolution by this Governing Board to release or otherwise terminate
the services of any impacted individual.

The proposed reductions totaled 84.233 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions.

4.

The Board established “competency” criteria in its Resolution, which states in

part:

[¶ . . .¶]

D.

That, for those employees other than those serving in Adult School positions,
“competency” as described in Education Coe section 44955(b) for the purposes of
bumping shall necessarily include: (1) possession of a valid credential in the
relevant subject matter area; (2) “highly qualified” status under the No Child Left
Behind Act in the position into which the employee is bumping; (3) an
appropriate EL authorization (if required by the position)2; and (4) with respect to
specialty positions such as JROTC Instructor, Special Education Program
Specialist, Safe and Supportive Schools (S3) Grant Coordinator, and/or AVID
teachers, at least one (1) complete year of experience in the position or
assignment within the last three (3) years.

E.

That, for those employees serving in Adult School Positions, “competency” as
described in Education Code section 44955(b) for the purposes of bumping shall

2 For employees serving in positions identified for layoff that do not require an EL

authorization competency Criteria 3 shall not apply.

4

necessarily include: (1) possession of a valid credential in the relevant subject
matter area; and (2) at least one (1) complete year of experience in the District
within the last three (3) years in the subject matter area to be assumed (based on
curriculum rather than course title)3

The Board established the competency criteria for purposes of bumping or displacing

more junior employees with senior employees who were competent and credentialed to hold the
position held by the junior employees. There is no evidence that the competency criteria were
arbitrary or capricious or otherwise invalid.

5.

Between/among employees who first rendered paid service to the District on

the same date, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2012-44, “Resolution to Adopt Criteria for
Resolving Ties in Seniority Related to Certificated Layoffs”, and provided clear instruction
for implementation of the criteria. The order of termination under the tie-breaking criteria
was based on the needs of the District and its students.

6.

On March 8, 2012, Steven Sonnnich, the District’s Associate Administrator,

Human Resources (Associate Administrator), served permanent and probationary certificated
Respondents with “Notice of Recommendation That Services Will Not Be Required”
(Notice), relevant portions of Board Resolution No. 2012-44 and stated the reasons for the
Board’s action. In addition, the Notice included the Accusation Against Respondents (made
and filed by the Superintendent on March 8, 2012), blank Request for Hearing and Notice of
Defense, and relevant sections of the Education Code and the Government Code. The
District’s Associate Administrator advised Respondents of the right to hearing, that the
Request for Hearing and Notice of Defense must be delivered to the District’s office no later
than March 26, 2012, and that the failure to request a hearing would constitute waiver of the
right to hearing.

7.

On March 8, 2012, the District’s Associate Administrator served Respondents

(under a temporary contract of employment) with “Notice of Release from Temporary
Employment/Right to Request a Hearing” (Notice). In the Notice, the District’s Associate
Administrator stated, in pertinent part:

Please be advised that on March 7, 2012, the Governing Board of the
Grossmont Union High School District took action to release you as a
temporary certificated employee, effective June 30, 2012 or upon the
expiration of your temporary contract, whichever is first. This notice is
provided pursuant to the terms of your employment contract and/or Education
Code section 44954.

3 For those employees serving in Adult School classes, bumping shall only be
permitted within the Adult School Program. No Adult School employee may displace an
employee in the District’s general or special education programs.

5

In addition to this letter, the District has provided you with a notice of layoff
and right to request a hearing in connection with the layoff proceedings
applicable to probationary and permanent employees under Education Code
sections 44949 and 44955. Please read that packet carefully. This notice is
provided to you as a precaution by the District. Based on your service under a
valid temporary contract of employment, the District believes you are
correctly classified as a temporary employee, and not entitled to participate in
the layoff or hearing process. However, that packet is provided in the event
you believe, or it is determined, your status is other than that of a temporary
employee, and you wish to contest your release as a temporary employee or
otherwise seek a determination whether there is cause for not reemploying you
for the next school year.

By providing this right to request a hearing, it is not the District’s intent to
convert your temporary employment status to that of a probationary or
permanent employee. In the event it is determined you are a probationary or
permanent employee by operation of law, your right to a hearing, and any
accompanying layoff rights, has been afforded under Education Code sections
44949 and 44955 via that notice.

He attached a copy of relevant portions of Board Resolution No. 2012-44 and stated the
reasons for the Board’s action. In addition, the Notice included the Accusation Against
Respondents (made and filed by the Superintendent on March 8, 2012), Request for Hearing
and Notice of Defense, and relevant sections of the Education Code and the Government
Code. The District’s Associate Administrator advised Respondents of the right to hearing,
that the Request for Hearing and Notice of Defense must be delivered to the District’s office
no later than March 26, 2012, and that the failure to request a hearing would constitute
waiver of the right to hearing.

Respondents submitted a timely Request for Hearing and Notice of Defense to

determine if there was cause for not re-employing him or her for the ensuing school year.

On March 26, 2012, the District served Notice of Hearing in accordance with

Government Code section 11509 on Respondents, setting the hearing for April 11, 2012.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements were satisfied.

There was no appearance by or on behalf of Respondents Richard Hogue,

Cody Kuhlken and David Yang.

Rohmer, Bridgett Desonia and Jose Garcia.

The District seeks to release temporary employees in the EIA/SCE4 and QEIA5

programs, categorically funded programs.

Respondent Jennifer Serban (Respondent Serban) and Respondent Ashley

Worth (Respondent Worth) entered into contracts with the District to perform services in the
EIA/SCE program, a categorically funded program, not required by federal or state statute.

The District identified the contract for which the services were performed.
Respondent Serban’s contract was effective August 31, 2011, and Respondent Worth’s
contract was effective January 30, 2012. Each contract terminated on June 21, 2012. Each
contract indicates that the certificated employees were hired pursuant to Education Code
section 44909 and were temporary employees. Respondents Serban and Worth were
employed for the “entire or remaining term of the contract or project.”

Through the EIA/SCE program, the District receives supplemental funds from the

State for economic impact aid. Typically it is targeted for students who need assistance
increasing their English language abilities.

In order to receive funding for the EIA program (as well as some other categorically

funded programs), the District submits a Consolidated Categorical Funding Application
(Application) to the California Department of Education. When the funding is authorized,
the duration of funding is a fiscal year. In this case, funding for the EIA/SCE program is for
July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012. As such, the funding allocation ends on June 30, 2012.
The District has not received funding for this categorical program for the 2012/2013 school
year, and the Application is not due for the ensuing school year until June 2012. As such, the
District’s Associate Administrator of Human Resources testified that he cannot state with
confidence that the EIA/SCE funding will be available for 2012 - 2013 school year; at this
time, the District does not have EIA/SCE funding for the 2012 – 2013 school year; if the
District does not receive the EIA/SCE funding, the District will end the project for the 2012
– 2013 school year. Considering the foregoing facts, it is determined that the District’s
EIA/SCE program is a year-to-year categorical program; funding for the EIA/SCE program
will terminate on June 30, 2012; termination of funding constitutes expiration of the
EIA/SCE program.

Based on the foregoing, the District intends to release Respondents Serban and

Worth.

Respondents Alicea Leroy, Marilynn Sue Asch, Michelle Clark-Cadwell, Tara

Egipto, Travis Engstrand, Michael French, Annika Goodin, Cleophus Harris Jr., Sophia
Jacoub, Jose Lucero, Erica Luster, Matthew McGlenn, Carma Sanchez and Matthew
Udvarhelyi (collectively referred to as QEIA temps) entered into contracts with the District

7

to perform services in the QEIA program, a categorically funded program, not required by
state or federal statute.

The District identified the contract for which the services were performed. Each of

the QEIA temps has a contract with the District with specific effective and termination dates.
Each contract states that these certificated employees were hired pursuant to Education Code
section 44909 and that they were temporary employees. Once they were assigned 44909
contracts to serve in the QEIA program, the QEIA temps served only in their identified
categorically funded assignments and no other. These employees were thus employed for the
“entire or remaining term of the contract or project.”

The District’s Associate Administrator of Human Resources described the QEIA

Program. It was a product of a settlement of a lawsuit by the California Teachers’
Association and the State of California that involved a “dispute about funding that should
have come to education in prior years” that did not. The agreement was to create a
mechanism by which those funds would be provided to schools that had test scores that were
considered to be under achieving.

Funding for the QEIA program traditionally lasts for seven years. The District first

received QEIA funds in the 2007 – 2008 school year. At that time, the District implemented
the QEIA program and hired categorical temps. In addition, they hired probationary and
permanent employees in this program. It has continued since the 2007 – 2008 school year.
By letter, dated February 28, 2012, the District’s Superintendent was notified that one of its
schools did not meet one or more of the QEIA program requirements in the 2010 – 2011
school year. As a consequence QEIA funding will terminate effective June 30, 2012.
Termination of funding constitutes expiration of the QEIA program

Based on the foregoing, the District intends to release the QEIA temps.

16.

The District considered all positively assured attrition in determining the

actual number of final layoff notices to be delivered to its certificated employees.

17.

Jeanette Liljestrom, the District’s executive secretary, Human Resources

(Executive Secretary), was responsible for implementing the technical aspects of the layoff.
She developed a seniority list for probationary or permanent certificated employees who
received preliminary notices of layoff. It included, among other matters, the teacher’s name,
seniority date, status, site, assignment, and credential(s), credential(s) subjects authorization
and English Language Learner Authorization (if any).

The seniority date was based on the first date of paid service rendered in a

probationary status.6

6 Education Code section 44845

8

18.

The District’s Executive Secretary used the seniority list to develop a proposed

order of layoff. Then, she determined whether the least senior employees subject to the
layoff held credentials in another area that would entitle them to “bump” into the position
held by a more junior employee. In determining who would be laid off for each kind of
service reduced, she counted the number of reductions and determined the impact on
incumbent staff in inverse order of seniority. Then, the District’s Executive Secretary
checked the credentials of affected individuals and whether they could “bump” other
employees, considering the District’s “competency” criteria established by the Board in its
Resolution.

19.

Some employees named as Respondents have the same seniority date. In

compliance with Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), in order to determine the
order of termination of employees with the same seniority date, the Board adopted
“Resolution to Adopt Criteria for Resolving Ties in Seniority Related to Certificated
Layoffs.” According to the evidence in the record, the District properly applied the criteria
to rank employees hired on the same date.

20.

The services that the District proposed to reduce were “particular kinds of

services” that can be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section
44955. The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue these particular kinds of services was
not arbitrary or capricious but constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

21.

The Board’s reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services related to
the welfare of the District and its pupils. The reduction or elimination of particular kinds of
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the District as
determined by the Board.

22.

No certificated employee junior to any Respondent has been retained to

perform services that any Respondent was certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 and

44955. All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in these sections are satisfied.

2.

A District may reduce services within the meaning of Education Code section
44955, subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall
not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford vs. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.)

9

3.

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the District

to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services. The cause for the reduction or
discontinuance of particular kinds of services is related solely to the welfare of the schools
and the pupils thereof.

4.

Respondents Serban and Worth and the QEIA temps contend that their release
as temporary employees is improper because the criteria in Stockton7 have not been satisfied,
arguing that the EIA/SCE and QEIA programs have not been terminated; as such, they are
entitled to be treated as probationary employees and therefore entitled to the due process
protections of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 prior to a separation from
employment.

5.

Education Code section 44909 states in pertinent part:

The governing board of any school district may employ . . . certificated
employees in programs and projects to perform services conducted under
contract with public or private agencies, or categorically funded projects
which are not required by federal or state statutes. The terms and conditions
under which such persons are employed shall be mutually agreed upon by the
employee and the governing board and such agreement shall be reduced to
writing . . . Service pursuant to this section shall not be included in computing
the service required as a prerequisite to attainment of, or eligibility to,
classification as a permanent employee unless … Such persons may be
employed for periods which are less than a full school year and may be
terminated at the expiration of the contract or specially funded project without
regard to other requirements of this code respecting the termination of
probationary or permanent employees other than Section 44918. Whenever
any certificated employee in the regular educational program is assigned to a
categorically funded project not required by federal or state statute and the
district employs an additional credentialed person to replace that certificated
employee, the replacement certificated employee shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 44918. . .

6.

As reflected in case law, categorically funded teachers are treated like

temporary employees. (Zalac v. Ferndale Unified School District (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838,
840-841 [A kindergarten teacher’s first two years of employment was as a temporary
employee in a categorically funded program pursuant to Education Code section 44909].) In
Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v. Bakersfield City School District (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 1260, the Court of Appeal found that teachers in categorically funded positions
“are treated in much the same way [as temporary employees] in that they may be dismissed
without the formalities required for probationary and permanent employees in the event the
program expires or is terminated, and their service does not count toward acquiring

7 Stockton Teachers Ass’n CTA/NEA v. Stockton Unified Sch. Dist. (2012) 2012

Cal.App.LEXIS 372.

10

permanent status (unless they are reemployed the following year in a probationary position).”
However, the Bakersfield Court, citing Zalac, noted the purpose of Education Code section
44909 was “‘to prevent a person from acquiring probationary status solely through teaching
in a categorically funded program. This permits the hiring of qualified persons for
categorically funded programs of undetermined duration without incurring responsibility to
grant tenured status based on such teaching services alone.’ [Citation.] The section ‘was
intended to give school districts flexibility in the operation of special educational programs
to supplement their regular program and to relieve them from having a surplus of
probationary or permanent teachers when project funds are terminated or cut back.’
[Citation.]” (Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v. Bakersfield City School
District, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1286.) To characterize categorically funded
Respondents as probationary employees would be contrary to that purpose. (See also Haase
v. San Diego Community College District (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 913 [for additional support
through analysis of a certificated employee in a categorically funded position in a community
college district not found to be a probationary employee].)

7.

Stockton Teachers Ass’n v. Stockton Unified Sch. Dist. (2012) 2012 Cal.App.

LEXIS 372 is the newest decision interpreting Section 44909. In this case, the Court held
that, in order to release an employee as temporary under Education Code section 44909, a
District must:

a. Prove the employee was hired to perform services conducted under a

contract with public or private agencies or categorically funded projects
that are not required by federal or state statutes;
Identify the particular contract or project expired;

b.
c. Establish when the particular contract or project expired; and
d. Show that the employee was hired for the same or remaining term of the

contract or project.

In this case, based on the evidence in this record (Findings 14 and 15), it was established that
the District satisfied the Stockton criteria. Considering the evidence regarding the status of
funding the EIA/SEC and QEIA programs, to hold otherwise would be contrary to the
purpose of the statute (Section 44909), i.e. “to benefit school districts by allowing them to
operate special programs outside their regularly funded programs, without having a surplus
of probationary or permanent employees when such special programs expire.” (Stockton
Teachers Ass’n v. Stockton Unified Sch. Dist. (2012) 2012 Cal.App. LEXIS 372 at 5 (citing
Zalac v. Bd. of Ferndale Unified Sch. Dist. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838, 845.)

8.

The District proved the four elements of the Stockton case with regard to its

EIA/SEC program. Therefore, the District properly released Respondents Serban and Worth
as temporary employees when they released them from District employment.

9.

The District proved the four elements of the Stockton case with regard to the

QEIA program. Therefore, the District properly released Respondents Alicea Leroy,
Marilynn Sue Asch, Michelle Clark-Cadwell, Tara Egipto, Travis Engstrand, Michael

11

French, Annika Goodin, Cleophus Harris Jr., Sophia Jacoub, Jose Lucero, Erica Luster,
Matthew McGlenn, Carma Sanchez and Matthew Udvarhelyi as temporary employees when
they released them from District employment.

10.

The District may dismiss Respondents Serban and Worth and the QEIA temps

in the manner the law allows regarding temporary employees. It is noted that the District
served these Respondents with the jurisdictional documents and provided them the
opportunity to participate in the instant hearing. These Respondents participated in the
hearing to the fullest extent possible, as if probationary or permanent employees. Had the
administrative law judge concluded that categorically funded Respondents were
probationary, they would have been entitled to the hearing that was had and in which they
participated.

11.

A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a
continuing position that he/she is certificated and competent to fill. In doing so, the senior
employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that position. (Lacy vs.
Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469.)

12.

The District has the discretion to determine whether teachers are certificated
and competent to hold the position for which said teachers have been skipped and retained.
(King v. Berkeley Unified School District (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 1016.) Junior teachers may
be given retention priority over senior teachers if the junior teachers possess superior skills or
capabilities that their more senior counterparts lack. (Poppers v. Tamalpais Union High
School District (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 399; Santa Clara Federation of Teachers, Local 2393
v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified School District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831).

13.

The District established cause to not reemploy Respondents for the ensuing

school year, and Respondents did not establish facts or sufficient legal argument to the
contrary.

14.

No employee with less seniority than any Respondent is being retained to

perform a service that any Respondent is certificated and competent to render.

15.

All arguments not addressed herein are not supported by the evidence and/or

the law and therefore rejected.

1.

The layoff notices issued to Respondents Marguerite Rohmer, Bridgett

Desonia and Jose Garcia are rescinded. The Accusation served upon Respondents
Marguerite Rohmer, Bridgett Desonia and Jose Garcia is dismissed.

2.

Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph of this Order, the Accusation

served on Respondents listed on Exhibit “B” is sustained; notice shall be given to these

ORDER

12

Respondents listed on Exhibit “B” before May 15, 2012, that their services will not be
required for the 2012-2013 school year because of the reduction or discontinuance of
particular kinds of services.

3.

Notice shall be given in inverse order of seniority.
