FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1, 

Patrick  Godwin  (the  Superintendent)  is  the  Superintendent  of  the  Folsom 
Cordova  Unified  School  District  (District).  At  all  times  relevant  to  this  Decision,  Larry 
Brubaker,  Assistant  Superintendent  for  Human  Resources,  (the  Assistant  Superintendent) 
was  duly  delegated  and  authorized  to  act  for  the  Superintendent.  The  Assistant 
Superintendent  made  and  filed  the  Accusation  and  issued  the  preliminary  notices  set  forth 
below  in  his  official  capacity  only. 

2. 

Respondents  are  and  at  all  times  relevant  to  this  Decision  were  certificated 

employees  of  the  District. 

3. 

On  or  just  before  March  7,  2008,  in  accordance  with  Education  Code  sections 
44949  and  44955,  the  Superintendent  notified  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  in  writing 
of  the  Superintendent’s  recommendation  that  certain  particular  kinds  of  services  would  have 
to  be  reduced  or  eliminated  for  the  upcoming  school  year.  The  Superintendent’s  notice 
specified  the  particular  kinds  of  services  to  be  reduced  or  eliminated,  as  set  forth  below.  The 
Superintendent  also  notified  the  Board  that  a  corresponding  number  of  certificated 
employees  of  the  District  would  have  to  be  laid  off  to  effectuate  the  reduction  or  elimination 
of  the  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  Superintendent  notified  the  Board  that  the 
respondents  were  among  those  who  had  been  identified  as  persons  to  whom  notice  should  be 
given  that  their  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  school  year.  The 
recommendation  that  respondents’  services  for  the  District  would  not  be  required  for  the 
upcoming  school  year  was  not  related  to  their  skills,  abilities  or  performance  as  teachers. 

4, 

The  Board  adopted  its  Resolution  03-05-08-28  on  March  5,  2008.  The  Board 
resolved  to  follow  the  Superintendent’s  recommendation  to  reduce  75.15  full  time  equivalent 
(FTE)  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  Resolution  authorized  and  directed  the 
Superintendent  to  give  notice  to  a  corresponding  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the 
District  that  their  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  upcoming  school  year  in  order  to 
effectuate  the  reduction.  The  Resolution  authorized  the  elimination  of  the  following  services 
now  offered  in  the  District:

The  Superintendent  caused  each  of  the  respondents  identified  in 

ATTACHMENT A to  this  Decision  to  be  served  with  a  written  Notice  of  Intention  to 
Dismiss  (preliminary  notice)  on  or  before  March  15,  2008.  The  written  preliminary  notices 
advised  the  respondents  of  the  Superintendent’s  recommendation  to  the  Board  that  their 
services  would  not  be  required  for  the  upcoming  school  year.  The  preliminary  notice  set 
forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation  and  for  the  reductions  and  eliminations  of  the 
particular  kinds  of  services.

a  Notice  of  Defense  to  the  Accusation,  either  in  person  or  through  counsel. 

The  respondents  identified  by  name  in  ATTACHMENT B to  this  Decision 

Each  respondent  identified  in  ATTACHMENT C to  this  Decision  timely  filed 

each  timely  filed  a  written  Request  for  Hearing  to  determine  if  there  was  cause  for  not 
reemploying  them  for  the  ensuing  year. 

The  District  timely  served  Accusations  on  each  respondent  who  timely  filed  a 
Request  for  Hearing.  Along  with  being  served  the  Accusation,  each  respondent  also  received 
a  copy  of  the  Board’s  Resolution  and  copy  of  the  detail  identifying  each  particular  kind  of 
service  slated  by  the  District  for  reduction  or  elimination. 

    

whether  there  exists  cause  to  not  reemploy  respondents  receiving  a  preliminary  notice  of 
layoff  was  duly  given  by  the  District  to  all  respondents  who  timely  filed  Requests  for 
Hearing  and  Notices  of  Defense.  The  date  and  time  of  the  evidentiary  hearing  was  changed 
upon  mutual  request  of  counsel  for  the  District  and  counsel  for  most  of  the  respondents. 
Counsel  advised  represented  respondents  of  the  changes.  Satisfactory  proof  was  made  that 
notice  of  the  changes  in  the  date  and  time  of  the  evidentiary  hearing  was  given  to  the 
unrepresented  respondents  in  a  fashion  that  would  permit  their  appearance,  should  they  elect 
to  do  so.  One  such  unrepresented  respondent,  Ms.  Garcia,  did  appear.  She  confirmed  the 
District  made  the  change  of  date  and  time  abundantly  clear,  and  that  four  other  unrepresented

Notice  of  the  date,  time  and  place  of  the  evidentiary  hearing  to  determine 

9. 

  

respondents  work  with  her  and  were  aware  of  the  changes.  The  District  served  each 
unrepresented  respondent  who  filed  a  Notice  of  Defense  with  a  notice  that  the  date  and  time 
of  the  evidentiary  hearing  had  been  changed,  and  advised  of  the  new  time  and  date  (Exhibit 
2).  Service  of  the  Notices  of  Hearing  and  the  notice  changing  the  time  and  date  of  the 
hearing  to  the  unrepresented  respondents  was  reviewed  by  the  Administrative  Law  Judge  on 
the  record  and  was  found  to  have  met  the  requirements  of  Government  Code  sections  11505 
and  11509.  As  to  those  unrepresented  respondents  who  failed  to  appear,  as  identified  in  the 
Preamble,  the  matter  was  conducted  as  a  default,  pursuant  to  Government  Code  section 
11520. 

10. 

The  represented  respondents,  through  counsel,  the  District,  through  counsel, 

and  Ms.  Garcia,  on  her  own  behalf,  each  stipulated  and  agreed  to  the  following:

A. 
further  evidentiary  hearing; 

The  agreements  reduced  to  writing  in  Exhibit  1  shall  form  the  basis  for  the 

B. 
Factual  Findings  of  this  Decision; 

That,  based  on  the  stipulation,  the  represented  respondents  and  those  failing  to 

Cc. 
appear  for  the  evidentiary  hearing  after  having  received  a  Notice  of  Hearing, 
withdraw  their  requests  for  hearing  and  Notices  of  Defense;  and 

D. 
That  all  represented  respondents  and  those  unrepresented  respondents 
receiving  a  Notice  of  Hearing  but  who  failed  to  appear  for  the  evidentiary  hearing 
stipulate  and  agree  that: 

Each  respondent  is  the  proper  subject  of  receipt  of  a  preliminary  notice  of 

1. 
layoff,  except  as  otherwise  set  forth  in  this  Decision; 

That  factual  and  legal  cause  exists  to  lay  off  each  respondent,  except  as  set 

2. 
forth  in  this  Decision;  and 

Each  respondent,  except  as  otherwise  set  forth  in  this  Decision,  waives  and 

3. 
relinquishes  his  or  her  right  to  an  evidentiary  hearing  as  set  forth  in  Education  Code 
sections  44949  and  44955,  and  Government  Code  section  11500,  et.seq. 

E. 
Legal  cause  for  actions  set  forth  in  the  agreements  of  the  parties  set  forth  in 
Exhibit  1,  and  those  agreements  shall  form  the  basis  for  the  Decision;  and  that  the 
final  Order  in  this  matter,  to  be  submitted  to  the  Board  for  adoption,  shall  be  as  the 
parties  have  set  forth  in  Exhibit  1. 

F. 

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  for  the  evidentiary  hearing  and  the 

layoff  process  were  met.

  

Each  of  the  parties  freely  and  voluntarily  entered  into  the  stipulation,  and  each 
thereupon  waived  the  right  to  any  additional  evidentiary  hearing  on  any  of  the  matters  raised 
by  this  action.  Ms.  Garcia,  as  the  only  unrepresented  respondent  appearing  at  the  evidentiary 
hearing,  joined  in  all  of  the  stipulations  and  waivers  made  by  the  represented  respondents  set 
forth  above. 

12. 

The  Superintendent,  on  behalf  of  the  District,  considered  all  known  attrition, 

resignations,  retirements  and  requests  for  transfer  in  determining  the  actual  number  of 
necessary  layoff  notices  to  be  delivered  to  its  employees. 

District  will  not  eliminate  any  services  that  are  State  or  federally  mandated. 

It  was  stipulated  and  agreed  between  the  parties  that  preliminary  notices  and  *

the  particular  kinds  of  services  is  48.2  FTE. 

20. 

Certificated  employees  of  the  District  receiving  final  notice  of  layoff  shall  be 
entitled  to  all  of  the  protections  set  forth  in  Education  Code  section  44957,  including,  but  not 
limited  to,  placement  (as  appropriate)  on  either  the  39  month  or  24  month  rehire  list. 

21. 

The  parties  stipulated  and  agreed  that  the  District  need  not  take  any  further 

action  as  required  in  Education  Code  sections  44955  and  44949  with  respect  to  the 
employees  set  forth  in  Paragraph  18  above  in  order  to  accomplish  the  layoff  of  those 
employees.  The  parties  stipulate  and  agree  that  final  notice  of  layoff  may  be  given  to  those 
employees  set  forth  in  Paragraph  18. 

22. 

During  the  24  or  39  month  reemployment  period  the  parties  agree  that  the 

following  shall  apply: 

a. 

Provided  the  employee  is  credentialed  and  competent  to  render  the  service,  the 

District  shall  offer  any  vacant  probationary  or  permanent  positions  to  laid-off  employees  in 
order  of  original  hire  date  (with  same  day  of  hire  ties  broken  as  shown  on  the  District’s 
Seniority  List), 

1. 

Should  any  employee  be  reappointed  to  a  probationary  or  permanent  position,

treated  as  a  break  in  the  continuity  of  service. 

2. 

Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  the  Education  Code,  the  employee  shall  retain 

the  classification  and  order  of  employment  he  or  she  had  when  his  or  her  services  were 
terminated,  as  provided  in  Education  Code  section  44957. 

b. 

The  District  shall  offer  any  substitute  positions  of  employment  (for  which  a

order  of  original  hire  date  (most  senior  first). 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949 

and  44955.  All  notices  and  jurisdictional  prerequisites  required  by  those  sections  were 
satisfied.  The  District  has  the  burden  of  proving  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  the 
proposed  reduction  or  elimination  of  particular  kinds  of  services  and  the  preliminary  notices 
of  layoff  served  on  respondents  are  factually  and  legally  appropriate. 

"  Education  Code  section  44944,

  

  

2. 

The  services  the  District  seeks  to  eliminate  in  this  matter,  as  set  forth  in 
Resolution  No.  03-05-08-28,  are  “particular  kinds  of  services”  that  may  be  reduced  or 
discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955.  The  Board’s  decision  to 
reduce  or  discontinue  these  particular  kinds  of  services  was  not  arbitrary  or  capricious,  but 
constituted  a  proper  exercise  of  the  Board’s  discretion.  Legal  cause  exists  pursuant  to 
Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  Folsom-Cordova  Unified  School  District 
to  reduce  or  discontinue  75.15  FTE  of  particular  kinds  of  services,  as  set  forth  in  the 
District’s  Resolution  and  identified  in  Factual  Finding  4.  The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of 
these  identified  particular  kinds  of  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District  and  its 
pupils. 

3. 

Legal  cause  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  to 

give  the  respondents  identified  in  Paragraph  18  of  the  Factual  Findings  final  notice  that  their 
services  will  not  be  required  for  school  year  2008/2009.  Legal  cause  exists  to  sustain  the 
Accusations.  The  Board  may  give  the  Paragraph  18  respondents  final  notices  that  their 
services  will  not  be  required  by  the  District  in  the  upcoming  school  year,  in  inverse  order  of 
seniority. 

ORDER 

The  Accusations  with  respect  to  those  respondent  certificated  employees  of  the 
Folsom-Cordova  Unified  School  District  identified  in  paragraph  14  of  the  Factual  Findings 
above  are  DISMISSED. 

The  Accusations  with  respect  to  those  respondent  certificated  employees  of  the 
Folsom-Cordova  Unified  School  District  identified  in  paragraph  18  of  the  Factual  Findings 
above  are  SUSTAINED. 

The  Folsom-Cordova  Unified  School  District  action  to  reduce  or  eliminate  75.15  FTE 

of  particular  kinds  of  services  for  the  2008/2009  school  year  is  AFFIRMED. 

Final  notice  may  by  the  District  to  the  respondents  identified  in  Paragraph  18  that 
their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  upcoming  school  year.  Notice  shall  be  given  in 
inverse  order  of  seniority.
