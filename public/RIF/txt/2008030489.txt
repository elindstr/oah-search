FACTUAL  FINDINGS  AND  DISCUSSION 

JL 

Scott  Leaman  is  the  Superintendent  of  the  Western  Placer  Unified  Schoo] 

District  (District),  His  actions  and  the  actions  of  the  District  Governing  Board  were  taken  in 
their  official  capacities. 

  

 

  

2. 

Respondents  are  permanent  or  probationary  certificated  employees  of  the 

District.  On  March  12,  2008,  the  District  served  on  each  respondent  a  written  notice  that  it 
had  been  recommended  that  notice  be  given  to  respondents  pursuant  to  Education  Code 
sections  44949  and  44955  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or  would  not  be  required  for 
the  2008-2009  school  year.  Each  written  notice  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation 
and  noted  that  the  District  Governing  Board  had  passed  a  Resolution  reducing  the 
certificated  staff  by  20.7  full-time  equivalent  (FTE)  positions.  Respondents  timely  requested 
in  writing  a  hearing  to  determine if  there  is  cause  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  ensuing 
school  year. 

3. 

The  Superintendent  made  and  filed  Accusations  against  respondents.  The 
Accusations  with  required  accompanying  documents  and  blank  Notices  of  Defense  were 
timely  served  on  respondents.  Each  respondent,  except  Cassandra  Walker,  timely  filed  a 
Notice  of  Defense  to  the  Accusation. 

4. 

On  March  11,  2008,  at  a  regular  meeting,  the  District  Governing  Board  was 
given  notice  of  the  Superintendent’s  recommendations  that  certificated  employees  holding 
20.7  FTE  positions  be  given  notice  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or  not  required  for 
the  next  school  year  and  stating  the  reasons  for  that  recommendation. 

5. 

On  March  11,  2008,  the  District  Governing  Board  determined  that  it  was 

necessary  to  decrease  programs  and  services  and  thus  it  was  necessary  to  reduce  teaching 
services  affecting  employment  of  20.7  FTE  positions.  The  District  Governing  Board  adopted 
Resolution  No.  07-08.14  providing  for  the  reduction  or  elimination  of  the  following 
particular  kinds  of  services  (PKS): 

1.0  FTE 
12.0  FTE

previously  served  with  Accusations.’  In  addition,  notices  to  respondents  Jenna  Daniels  and 
Melanie  Riley-Gonzalez,  which  had  previously  been  for  1.0  FTE  each,  were  adjusted  to  .7 
FTE  and  .5  FTE,  respectively. 

At  the  time  of  hearing  layoff  notices  were  rescinded  as  to  five  individuals 

'  These  individuals  were  Lacey  Anderson,  Laura  Mosbacher,  Lisa  Riddagh,  Molly  Sjordal  and  Susan  Wagner.

The  District  served  an  Accusation  and  Notice  of  Defense  form  on  Cassandra 
Walker.  These  and  other  documents  were  sent  by  the  District  via  certified  mail  on  April  4, 
2008.  Ms.  Walker  never  received  these  documents.  She  checked  to  see  if  any  of  her  mail 
had  been  held  for  her  at  the  post  office  and  it  had  not  been  so  held.  The  Accusation  and 
Notice  of  Defense  form  were  mailed  to  her  correct  address.  She  did  receive  a  layoff  notice 
from  the  District  that  was  sent  to  the  same  address  via  certified  mail,  and  she  had  filed  a 
request  for  hearing.  Ms.  Walker  was  made  aware  of  these  proceedings  and  participated. 
Notwithstanding  her  failure  to  file  a  notice  of  defense,  she  may  participate  as  a  party  to  these 
proceedings. 

8. 

The  Governing  Board’s  resolution  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of 
services  was  made  in  order  to  reduce  costs  without  reducing  core  subject  areas.  The  District 
has  projected  2008-09  revenue  reductions  to  approximate  $1.2  million.  The  District  also 
projects  cost  increases  in  excess  of  $1  million.  The  combination  of  decreased  revenues 
received  from  the  state  and  cost  increases  has  created a  total  budget  shortfall  of  $2,335,801. 
The  District’s  budget  reduction  target  is  higher  ($2,634,302)  to  account  for  deficits  in 
available  fund  balances.  All  this  comes  at  a  time  when  enrollment  may  increase,  with 
projected  average  daily  attendance  up  by  as  many  as  additional  595  students.  Although  each 
additional  student  adds  revenue  to  the  District,  the  amount  the  District  receives  per  student 
has  declined.  And  combined  with  rising  costs,  the  increased  student  enrollment  will  not 
improve  the  District’s  fiscal  situation. 

9. 

The  District  maintains  a  Certificated  Seniority  List  which  contains  employees’ 

seniority  dates  (first  date  of  paid  service),  status  as  tenured,  probationary  or  temporary,  and 
credentials  and  authorizations.  Status,  credential  and  authorization  data  are  obtained  from 
the  District’s  records  and  employees  are  given  the  opportunity  to  correct  errors  in  the 
seniority  list. 

Robert  Noyes  is  the  District’s  Assistant  Superintendent,  Personnel  Services.  He  and 
other  District  employees  were  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  technical  aspects  of  the 
layoff.  The  District  used  the  seniority  list  to  develop  a  proposed  layoff  list  of  the  least  senior 
employees  currently  assigned  in  the  various  services  being  reduced.  The  District  then 
determined  whether  these  employees  held  credentials  in  another  area  and  were  entitled  to 
“bump”  other  employees. 

    

should  be  corrected  to  be  August  17,  2007,  to  account  for  their  attendance  at  a  new  teacher 
workshop  held  that  day,  from  8:00  a.m.  to  3:00  p.m.”  New  teachers  were  requested  to,  and 
understood  that  they  should  attend  this  workshop,  although  they  were  not  told  in  so  many 
words  that  their  attendance  was  mandatory.  They  were  neither  penalized  nor  disciplined  in 

?  The  nine  individuals  include:  Cynthia  Cygan,  Amanda  Fleshman,  Margaret  Hamrick,  Brenda  James,  Milagros 
Medina,  Melanie  Riley-Gonzalez,  Dayna  Swanson,  Julie  Walker  and  Amy  Williams. 

Nine  respondents  have  seniority  dates  of  August  20,  2007,  and  contend  that  it 

August  17,  2007  New  Teacher  Orientation 

 

10. 

  

any  way  for  failing  to  attend.  The  workshop  consisted  of  an  orientation  to  the  District  and 
introduction  to  key  personnel.  New  teachers  were  instructed  on  District  protocols  on  a  range 
of  matters  such  as  what  to  do  when  a  substitute  teacher  was  needed,  or  whom  to  go  to  for 
help  in  different  circumstances.  Time  was  also  set  aside  to  meet  with  the  Western  Placer 
Teachers  Association  (WPTA). 

e@ 

Article  XV  of  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  between  the  District  and  WPTA 

makes  specific  reference  to  183  duty  days  that  District  teachers  are  required  to  be  in 
attendance  over  the  course  of  a  work  year,  and  184  duty  days  for  teachers  new  to  the  District. 
The  additional  duty  day  for  new  teachers  was  meant  to  be  the  date  set  aside  for  the  new 
teacher  workshop/orientation,  in  this  case  the  one  held  on  August  17,  2007.  New  teachers 
were  not  paid  an  additional  amount  for  attending  the  workshop,  presumably  because  it  was 
part  of  the  184  duty  days  encompassed  within  their  annual  salary. 

11. 

Under  the  terms  of  the  collective  bargaining  agreement,  duty  days  are  those 

which  teachers  are  required  to  be  in  attendance.  The  August  17,  2007  new  teacher  workshop 
constituted  a  duty  day.  Thus,  it  should  have  been  considered  by  the  District  to  be  the  date 
attending  teachers  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  District. 

The  difficulty  presented  in  this  case  is  that  a  complete  list  of  attendees  at  the  August 
17,  2007  new  teacher  workshop  was  not  available  at  the  time  of  hearing.  It  is  likely  that  the 
large  majority  of  teachers  listed  by  the  District  as  having  an  August  20,  2007  seniority  date 
also  attended  the  workshop.  The  District  suggests  that  it  may  then  be  a  moot  issue.  The 
District  also  notes  that  all  teachers  were  afforded  an  opportunity  to  review  and  correct  their 
seniority  dates,  and  did  not  do  so.  There  was  no  evidence  that  earlier  adjustments  were  made 
to  account  for  attendance  at  the  workshop. 

e 

12. 

The  seniority  date  for  the  nine  respondents  who  attended  the  new  teacher 

workshop  should  be  changed  August  20,  2007,  to  August  17,  2007.  The  District  should  also 
change  the  seniority  date  of  other  new  teachers  who  attended  the  workshop  from  August  20, 
2007,  to  August  17,  2007.  After  these  adjustments  are  made,  the  District  should  rescind 
notices  to  the  degree  and  extent  that  the  August  17,  2007  seniority  date  places  respondents 
above  less  senior  teachers  who  were  not  given  layoff  notices. 

Teachers  Holding  District  Intern  or  University  Intern  Credentials  and  Who  Occupy 
Positions  for  Which  Respondents  are  Competent  and  Credentialed 

13. 

The  District’s  Governing  Board  met  on  or  around  April  15,  2008,  and 

determined  at  that  time  to  release  four  interns,  three  holding  a  district  intern  credential,  and 
one  holding  a  university  intern  credential.’  They  were  assigned  to  teach  high  school  English 

>  The  teachers  are:  David  Lynn  Foxworthy,  university  intern  with  a  single  subject  credential  for  biological  sciences; 
Jared  John  Gonsalves,  district  intern  with  a  single  subject  credential  for  mathematics;  Holli  Ann  Little,  district  intern 
with  a  single  subject  credential  for  English;  and  Lori  Janine  Schleppenbach,  district  intern  with  a  single  subject 
credential  for  mathematics. 

@ 

 

(1.0  FTE),  high  school  biological  science  (1.0  FTE),  and  eighth  grade  mathematics  (2.0 
FTE).  None  of  these  four  classes  were  identified  or  included  as  part  of  the  particular  kinds  of 
services  to  be  reduced  or  discontinued  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  four  interns  were 
not  issued  layoff  notices  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  Thus,  the  District 
may  consider  these  vacated  positions  in  much  the  same  way  as  it  would  consider  other 
positively  assured  attrition. 

Respondents  suggest  it  is  first  necessary  to  find  that  the  four  interns  were 
probationary  employees  in  order  for  other  teachers  to  move  into  their  positions.  It  is  not 
clear  why  such  a  finding  is  needed.  If  the  vacated  positions  are  not  slated  for  PKS 
reductions,  the  District  may  reassign  teachers  into  the  positions.  Still,  in  an  abundance  of 
caution,  there  was  no  evidence  presented  to  indicate  whether  these  teachers  were  serving 
under  temporary  employment  contracts  and  therefore  subject  to  annual  release.  For  example, 
there  was  no  evidence  that  any  of  the  four  were:  1)  replacing  a  teacher  on  leave  (Ed.  Code,  § 
44920);  2)  teaching  in  a  temporary  class  (Ed.  Code,  §  44919,  subd.  (a));  3)  teaching  in 
special  day  and  evening  adult  classes  (Ed.  Code,  §  44919,  subd.  (a));  4)  teaching  in  schools 
for  migratory  population  (Ed.  Code,  §  44919,  subd.  (b));  5)  serving  in  a  limited  assignment 
supervising  athletic  activities  (Ed.  Code,  §  44919,  subd.  (b));  or  6)  serving  in  any  other 
temporary  situations  identified  in  the  Education  Code. 

Appellate  courts  have  interpreted  the  temporary  classifications  narrowly,  allowing 

districts  to  classify  teachers  as  temporary  only  on  the  grounds  provided  in  the  Education 
Code.  Thus,  if  a  teacher  does  not  satisfy  the  statutory  grounds  for  a  temporary  classification, 
the  default  or  catchall  provision  of  Education  Code  section  44915  mandates  that  the  district 
classify  a  teacher  as  a  probationary  employee.  (Bakersfield  Elementary  Teachers 
Association  v.  Bakersfield  City  School  District  (2006)  145  Cal.App.4th  1260,  1279-1281; 
California  Teachers  Association  v.  Vallejo  City  Unified  School  District  (2007)  149 
Cal.App.4th  135,  146;  Vasquez  v.  Happy  Valley  Union  School  District  (2008)  159 
Cal.App.4th  969,  981-986.) 

With  this  in  mind,  the  District  is  required  to  make  assignments  and  reassignments  in 

such  a  manner  that  employees  shall  be  retained  to  render  any  service  which  their  seniority 
and  qualifications  entitle  them  to  render.  (Ed.  Code,  §  44955,  subd.  (c).)  And  this  includes 
potential  assignment  and  reassignment  into  the  positions  made  available  by  the  departure  of 
the  four  interns. 

14. 

Respondent  Jenna  Daniels  has a  District  Seniority  date  of  August  29,  2007. 

She  was  noticed  for  layoff  due  to  the  reduction  of  K-5  Science  by  .7  FTE.  Ms.  Daniels  holds 
asingle  subject  credential  for  biological  sciences.  She  is  qualified  to  teach  the  high  school 
biological  sciences  class  previously  taught  by  David  Lynn  Foxworthy.  No  one  with  greater 
seniority  than  Jenna  Daniels  possesses  the  credentials  and  qualifications  to  move  into  the 
position.  This  may  lead  to  a  part-time  bumping  situation,  if  Ms.  Daniels  retains  .3  FTE  K-5 
and  takes  only  .7  FTE  high  school  biological  sciences.  It  is  a  matter  better  left  for  the 
District  to  work  out  with  Ms.  Daniels. 

  

 

  

15. 

Three  other  teachers  were  identified  as  having  credentials  that  would  allow 
them  to  be  reassigned  next  year  to  the  two  eighth  grade  mathematics  classes,  and  one  high 
school  English  class.  Sandra  K.  Beckman  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential  with  a 
supplementary  authorization  to  teach  mathematics  (K-9).  She  is  currently  in  an  elementary 
school  position.  Rene  McGrath  also  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential  with  a  supplementary 
authorization  to  teach  mathematics  (K-9).  She  is  currently  in  an  elementary  school  position 
at  Carlin  C.  Coppin  Elementary  School.  Were  Ms.  Beckman  and  Ms.  McGrath  to  be 
reassigned  to  teach  eighth  grade  mathematics,  two  of  respondent  elementary  school  teachers 
could  be  assigned  to  teach  their  classes.  Melanee  Ford  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential 
with  a  supplementary  authorization  to  teach  English.  If  she  were  reassigned  to  teach  high 
school  English,  one  of  respondent  elementary  school  teachers  could  be  assigned  to  teach  her 
class. 

The  District’s  release  of  the  four  interns  results  in  four  positions  into  which  teachers 

may  be  reassigned.  Respondent  Jenna  Daniels  may  be  reassigned  into  high  school  biological 
sciences  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

The  District  has  discretion  as  to  whether  additional  assignments  and  reassignments 
should  be  made  to  save other  junior  teachers  named  as  respondents.  While  the  District  has 
an  affirmative  obligation  to  reassign  senior  teachers  who  are  losing  their  positions,  it  does 
not  have  the  same  obligation  to  reassign  senior  teachers  who  are  not  losing  their  positions  in 
an  effort  to  save  junior  teachers.  In  short,  the  District  cannot  be  compelled  to  engage  in 
inverse  bumping  and  to  reassign  Sandra  Beckman,  Rene  McGrath  and  Melanee  Ford  into  the 
positions  held  by  the  three  interns  in  order  to  save  respondent  elementary  school  teachers 
from  losing  their  positions. 

Other  Matters  Relating  to  Individual  Teachers 

16.  |  Brenda  James  and  Dayna  Swanson  teach  kindergarten  classes  at  Twelve 
Bridges  and  Lincoln  Crossing  Elementary  Schools,  respectively.  They  both  attended  a 
Kindergarten  Workshop  on  August  15,  2007,  from  8:00  a.m.  to  noon  at  Twelve  Bridges 
Elementary  School.  All  district  kindergarten  teachers  were  invited  to  attend.  The  purpose 
was  to  “collaboratively  create  a  kindergarten  assessment  packet  and  rubric  to  use  to  assess 
students  district-wide.”  Ms.  Swanson  was  told  that  she  “needed  to  attend.”  It  appears  that 
another  teacher  stated  this  to  her.  This  particular  program  was  subject  to  the  District’s 
professional  development  “buy-back  hours”  program.  Both  employees  received  four  hours 
credit  for  their  participation  and  were  compensated  for  their  time.  Attendance  was  not 
mandatory.  Given  the  nature  of  this  particular  workshop,  Ms.  James  and  Ms.  Swanson  are 
not  entitled  to  change  their  seniority  date  based  upon  their  attendance  at  same. 

17. 

Milagros  Medina  is  an  elementary  school  teacher.  She  attended  a  six-hour 

GLAD  Summer  Planning  program  on  August  8,  2007.  This  was  a  program  designed  to 
develop  strategies  for  working  with  students  in  the  District’s  English  Language  Learner 
program.  Participation  in  this  program  was  not  mandatory.  Ms.  Medina  received 

 

  

professional  development  credit  (buy-back  hours)  for  her  attendance.  She  is  not  entitled  to 
change  her  seniority  date  based  upon  her  attendance  at  this  program. 

18. 

Melanie  Riley  is  a  band  teacher  at  Lincoln  High  School.  She  holds  a  single 

subject  music  credential.  When  home  economics  was  reduced,  Cindy  Hagman  was 
reassigned  from  home  economics  into  Ms.  Riley’s  position.  Ms,  Hagman  holds  a  single 
subject  music  credential  with  a  CLAD.  Ms.  Hagman  is  also  more  senior  to  Ms.  Riley  and  is 
therefore  entitled  to  bump  into  her  position. 

Ms.  Riley  contests  application  of  any  tie-breaking  criteria  based  upon  her  not  having  a 

CLAD.  Ms.  Riley  finished  her  CLAD  coursework  in  January  2008,  and  has  submitted 
necessary  documentation  to  the  California  Commission  on  Teacher  Credentialing  (CTC). 
She  received  confirmation  from  CTC  that  her  application  is  pending  evaluation. 

Peggy  VanLengen  is  the  District’s  Personnel  Account  Technician.  In  mid-January 

2008,  she  contacted  Ms.  Riley  and  inquired  as  to  the  status  of  her  CLAD.  Ms.  Riley  advised 
her  that  she  would  be  done  with  the  course  by  the  end  of  the  month.  When  Ms.  Riley 
completed  the  course,  she  did  not  so  advise  the  District.  Ms.  Riley  believes  that  the  District 
should  credit  her  for  having  a  CLAD  pending.  The  District  has  done  so  for  others.  For 
example,  Melissa  Garcia  is  an  elementary  school  teacher  with  a  single  subject  music 
credential.  She  was  credited  with  having  a  “CLAD  pending”  and  is  still  taking  the  course 
toward  CLAD  certification,  the  test  for  which  will  be  given  in  June  2008.  Ms.  Riley  is 
obviously  ahead  of  her  and  should  also  be  credited  with  having  a  CLAD  pending  by  the 
District.  Although  employees  should  bear  the  responsibility  of  updating  their 
credentials/certifications  on  file  with  the  District,  this  is  an  instance  where  Ms.  Riley  was 
asked  by  the  District  in  mid-January  about  the  status  of  her  CLAD,  and  the  District  was  on 
notice  that  she  would  have  been  finished  with  her  CLAD  coursework  by  the  end  of  January 
2008. 

19. 

Amanda  Fleshman  is  a  second  grade  elementary  teacher  at  Twelve  Bridges 

Elementary  School.  She  is  currently  enrolled  and  taking  course  work  toward  CLAD 
certification.  The  class  will  continue  through  May  2008,  and  the  test  will  be  given  in  June 
2008.  She  is  in  the  same  class  as  Melissa  Garcia  and  believes  she  also  should  be  given  status 
as  CLAD  pending.  There  is  no  evidence  that  she  advised  the  District  of  these  facts  prior  to 
March  15,  and  she  should  not  be  accorded  CLAD  pending  status  for  this  reason. 

20. 

Thomas  Kelley  holds  a  pupil  personnel  services  credential  with  a 

specialization  in  school  counseling.  He  works  a  half  day  at  Phoenix  Continuation  School, 
and  a  half  day  at  Lincoln  High  School.  He  received  a  layoff  notice  because  of  the  planned 
elimination  of a  high  school  counselor  position,  The  Placer  County  Office  of  Education  will 
be  transferring  a  counselor  position  to  the  District  next  school  year  to  work  in  the  special 
education  area.  In  addition  to  holding  a  pupil  personnel  services  credential,  the  counselor 
position  will  require  additional  certification  in  either  behavior  analysis  or  applied  behavior 
analysis.  Mr.  Kelley  holds  neither  of  these  additional  certifications.  He  also  notes  that  the 
CTC  does  not  list  either  of  these  certifications  on  its  website  and  he  questions  whether  they 

 

  

can  legitimately  be  required  for  this  position.  He  is  willing  to  pursue  specializations  if  he  is 
hired  into  the  position. 

The  District  has  a  need  for  a  counselor  to  work  with  autistic  children  and  who  can 

conduct  behavioral  assessments  for  this  population.  Eli  Gallup  is  the  District’s  Director  of 
Special  Education.  He  explained  the  reasoning  for  having  the  special  education  counselor 
hold  additional  certifications  in  either  behavior  analysis  or  applied  behavior  analysis.  In 
making  reassignments,  a  district  is  permitted  to  consider  the  qualifications  of  an  employee 
prior  to  making  such  reassignment.  The  District  has  articulated  its  rationale  for  not  offering 
Mr.  Kelley  the  special  education  counselor  position.  Mr.  Kelley  has  not  demonstrated  that 
he  is  otherwise  qualified  to  serve  in  that  position. 

21. 

The  District  applied  tie-breaking  criteria  as  between  Kimberly  Moss  and 

Teresa  Conroy  in  reducing  physical  education  by  1.5  FTE.  Both  have  the  same  seniority 
date.  Ms.  Moss  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential  with  CLAD  and  a  physical  education 
authorization.  Ms.  Conroy  holds  a  single  subject  credential  in  physical  education.  Asa 
result  of  application  of  tie-breaking  criteria,  Ms.  Conroy  is  deemed  “more  senior”  to  Ms. 
Moss.  The  single  subject  credential  “trumps”  the  authorization  for  physical  education.  Thus, 
Ms.  Moss  was  noticed  for  1.0  FTE,  and  Ms.  Conroy  for  the  remaining  .5  FTE. 

22. 

With  due  consideration  and  adjustments  made  for  the  matters  noted  above,  no 
permanent  or  probationary  certificated  employees  junior  to  respondents  are  being  retained  to 
perform  a  service  which  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  render.  Those 
certificated  employees  junior  to  respondents  being  retained  will  provide  services  which 
respondents  are  not  certificated  and  competent  to  perform. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

L. 

2. 

The  District  employees  receiving  notices  that  their  services  would  not  be 

required  next  year  have  all  rendered  services  to  the  District. 

All  notice  and  jurisdictional  requirements  set  forth  in  Education  Code  sections 

44949  and  44955  were  met.  The  notices  sent  to  respondents  indicated  the  statutory  basis  for 
the  reduction  of  services  and,  therefore,  were  sufficiently  detailed  to  provide  them  due  process. 
(San  Jose  Teachers  Association  v.  Allen  (1983)  144  Cal.App.3d  627;  Santa  Clara  Federation 
of  Teachers  v.  Governing  Board  (1981)  116  Cal.App.3d  831.)  The  description  of  services  to 
be  reduced,  both  in  the  Board  Resolution  and  in  the  notices,  adequately  describe  particular 
kinds  of  services.  (Zalac  v.  Ferndale  USD  (2002)  98  Cal.App.4th  838.  See,  also,  Degener  v. 
Governing  Board  (1977)  67  Cal.App.3d  689.) 

3. 

The  services  identified  in  Board  Resolution  No.  07-08.14  are  particular  kinds 

of  services  (PKS)  that  could  be  reduced  or  discontinued  under  Education  Code  section 
44955.  The  Governing  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  identified  services  was 
neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  and  was a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion.  Cause  exists  to 

 

  

reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  due  to  the  reduction  and 
discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services.  Cause  for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of 
services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District’s  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of 
Education  Code  section  44949, 

4. 

A  District  may  reduce  services  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section 
44955,  subdivision  (b),  “either  by  determining  that  a  certain  type  of  service  to  students  shall 
not,  thereafter,  be  performed  at  all  by  anyone,  or  it  may  ‘reduce  services’  by  determining  that 
proffered  services  shall  be  reduced  in  extent  because  fewer  employees  are  made  available  to 
deal  with  the  pupils  involved.”  (Rutherford  v.  Board  of  Trustees  (1976)  64  Cal.App.3d  167, 
178-179.) 

5. 

Education  Code  section  44955  provides  in  pertinent  part: 

1.04 

(b)  Whenever  in  any  school  year  ...  whenever  a  particular  kind 
of  service  is  to  be  reduced  or  discontinued  not  later  than  the 
beginning  of  the  following  school  year,  ...or  whenever  the 
amendment  of  state  law  requires  the  modification  of  curriculum, 
and  when  in  the  opinion  of  the  governing  board  of  the  district  it 
shall  have  become  necessary  by  reason  of  any  of  these 
conditions  to  decrease  the  number  of  permanent  employees  in 
the  district,  the  governing  board  may  terminate  the  services  of 
not  more  than  a  corresponding  percentage  of  the  certificated 
employees  of  the  district,  permanent  as  well  as  probationary,  at 
the  close  of  the  school  year.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  by 
statute,  the  services  of  no  permanent  employee  may  be 
terminated  under  the  provisions  of  this  section  while  any 
probationary  employee,  or  any  other  employee  with  less 
seniority,  is  retained  to  render  a  service  which  said  permanent 
employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 
q..4 

6. 

Education  Code  section  44955  provides  that  when  certificated  employees  face 

layoffs  due  to  reduction  or  elimination  of  PKS,  the  District  has  an  affirmative  obligation  to 
reassign  senior  teachers  who  are  losing  their  positions  into  positions  held  by junior  teachers, 
if  the  senior  teacher  has  both  the  credentials  and  competence  to  occupy  such  positions.  The 
intent  of  the  Legislation  is  clearly  to  prevent  Districts  from  laying  off  senior  teachers  while 
retaining  junior  teachers.  Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (c)  provides  in 
pertinent  part: 

Services  of  such  employees  shall  be  terminated  in  the  inverse  of 
the  order  in  which  they  were  employed...  The  governing  board 
shall  make  assignments  and  reassignments  in  such  a  manner  that 

 

  

  

employees  shall  be  retained  to  render  any  service  which  their 
seniority  and  qualifications  entitle  them  to  render... 

) 

7. 

As  set  forth  in  Factual  Findings  10  through  12,  the  seniority  date  for  the  nine 

respondents  who  attended  the  new  teacher  workshop  should  be  changed  from  August  20, 
2007,  to  August  17,  2007.  The  District  should  also  change  the  seniority  date  of  other  new 
teachers  who  attended  the  workshop  from  August  20,  2007,  to  August  17,  2007.  After  these 
adjustments  are  made,  the  District  should  rescind  notices  to  the  degree  and  extent  that  the 
August  17,  2007  seniority  date  places  respondents  above  less  senior  teachers  who  were  not 
given  layoff  notices  and  who  occupy  positions  for  which  respondents  are  credentialed  and 
competent. 

8. 

As  set  forth  in  Factual  Findings  13  through  15,  the  District’s  release  of  the 

four  interns  results  in  four  positions  into  which  respondents  Jenna  Daniels  and  three  others 
may  be  reassigned  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  District  is  required  to  make 
assignments  and  reassignments  in  such  a  manner  that  employees  shall  be  retained  to  render 
any  service  which  their  seniority  and  qualifications  entitle  them  to  render.  (Ed.  Code,  § 
44955,  subd,  (c).)  This  includes  potential  assignment  and  reassignment  into  the  positions 
made  available  by  the  departure  of  the  four  interns.’  Respondent  Jenna  Daniels  should  be 
reassigned  into  high  school  biological  sciences  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  District 
has  discretion  as  to  the  other  three  positions. 

9. 

As  set  forth  in  Factual  Findings  16  and  17,  the  seniority  dates  of  Brenda 
James,  Dayna  Swanson  and  Milagros  Medina  should  not  be  changed  on  account  of  their 
attendance  at  the  Kindergarten  Workshop  or  the  GLAD  Summer  Planning  Program. 
Participation  in  these  programs  was  not  mandatory  and  the  employees  received  professional 
development  credit  (buy-back  hours)  for  their  attendance.  They  are  not  entitled  to  change 
their  seniority  date  based  upon  attendance  at  these  programs. 

e 

10. 

As  set  forth  in  Factual  Findings  18  and  19,  Melanie  Riley  should  be  credited 
with  CLAD  pending  status  in  any  application  of  tie-breaking  criteria.  However,  Amanda 
Fleshman  shall  not  be  so  credited. 

11. 

Asset  forth  in  Factual  Finding  20,  the  District  has  met  its  initial  obligation, 

under  Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (c),  to  make  a  determination  whether 
Thomas  Kelley’s  seniority  and  qualifications  entitle  him  to  be  reassigned  to  the  new  special 
education  counselor  position.  The  District  reasonably  decided  not  to  re-assign  Mr.  Kelley, 

  

*  The  four  interns  were  not  found  to  be  temporary  employees.  (See  Finding  13.)  As  noted  earlier,  appellate  courts 
have  interpreted  the  temporary  classifications  narrowly,  allowing  districts  to  classify  teachers  as  temporary  only  on 
the  grounds  provided  in  the  Education  Code.  Thus, if  a  teacher  does  not  satisfy  the  statutory  grounds  for  a 
temporary  classification,  the  default  or  catchall  provision  of  Education  Code  section  44915  mandates  that  the  district 
classify  a  teacher  as  a  probationary  employee.  (Bakersfield  Elementary  Teachers  Association  v.  Bakersfield  City 
School  District  (2006)  145  Cal.App.4th  1260,  1279-1281;  California  Teachers  Association  v.  Vallejo  City  Unified 
School  District  (2007)  149  Cal.App.4th  135,  146;  Vasquez  v.  Happy  Valley  Union  School  District  (2008)  159 
Cal.  App.4th  969,  981-986.)

based  upon  the  District’s  need  for  a  counselor  with  qualifications  related  to  behavior  analysis 
or  applied  behavior  analysis.  Mr.  Kelley  has  not  persuasively  rebutted  the  District’s  decision  * 
not  to  assign  him  to  this  position.  The  District  has  established  that  no  employee  junior  to  Mr. 
Kelley  is  being  retained  to  perform  services  which  Mr.  Kelley  is  competent  and  cértificated 
to  render. 

12. 

Cause  exists  for  the  reduction  of  the  particular  kinds  of  services  and  for  the 

reduction  of  20.7  full-time  equivalent  certificated  positions  at  the  end  of  the  2007-2008 
school  year  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  Therefore,  and  except  as 
noted  above  in  Legal  Conclusions  7  through  10,  cause  exists  to  give  respondents  notice  that 
their  services  will  be  reduced  or  will  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  2008-2009  school  year. 

ORDER 

Cause  exists  for  the  reduction  of  20.7  full-time  equivalent  certificated  positions  at  the 

end  of  the  2007-2008  school  year.  After  making  the  adjustments  set  forth  in  Legal 
Conclusions  7  through  10,  notice  shall  be  given  to  remaining  respondents  that  their  services 
will  be  reduced  or  will  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  school  year,  2008-2009,  because  of 
the  reduction  and  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of  services.

FACTUAL  FINDINGS  AND  DISCUSSION 

1. 

Scott  Leaman  is  the  Superintendent  of  the  Western  Placer  Unified  School 

District  (District).  His  actions  and  the  actions  of  the  District  Governing  Board  were  taken  in 
their  official  capacities. 

2. 

Respondents  are  permanent  or  probationary  certificated  employees  of  the 

District.  On  March  12,  2008,  the  District  served  on  each  respondent  a  written  notice  that  it 
had  been  recommended  that  notice  be  given  to  respondents  pursuant  to  Education  Code 
sections  44949  and  44955  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or  would  not  be  required  for 
the  2008-2009  school  year.  Each  written  notice  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation 
and  noted  that  the  District  Governing  Board  had  passed  a  Resolution  reducing  the 
certificated  staff  by  20.7  full-time  equivalent  (FTE)  positions.  Respondents  timely  requested 
in  writing  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  ensuing 
school  year. 

3. 

The  Superintendent  made  and  filed  Accusations  against  respondents.  The 
Accusations  with  required  accompanying  documents  and  blank  Notices  of  Defense  were 
timely  served  on  respondents.  Each  respondent,  except  Cassandra  Walker,  timely  filed  a 
Notice  of  Defense  to  the  Accusation. 

4, 

On  March  11,  2008,  at  a  regular  meeting,  the  District  Governing  Board  was 
given  notice  of  the  Superintendent’s  recommendations  that  certificated  employees  holding 
20.7  FTE  positions  be  given  notice  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or  not  required  for 
the  next  school  year  and  stating  the  reasons  for  that  recommendation. 

5. 

On  March  11,  2008,  the  District  Governing  Board  determined  that  it  was 

Counselor,  High  School 
K-5  Self-Contained  Classrooms 
K-5  Science 
9-12  Offerings 

necessary  to  decrease  programs  and  services  and  thus  it  was  necessary  to  reduce  teaching 
services  affecting  employment  of  20.7  FTE  positions.  The  District  Governing  Board  adopted 
Resolution  No.  07-08.14  providing  for  the  reduction  or  elimination  of  the  following 
particular  kinds  of  services  (PKS): 

     

Ag  Farm 
Physical  Education 
Home  Economics 
Continuation 
Independent  Study

1.0  FTE 
1.5  FTE 
1.0  FTE 
1.0  FTE 
1.0  FTE 
0.5  FTE 

1.0  FTE 
12.0  FTE 
1.7  FTE 

20.7  FTE 

Total 

6. 

At  the  time  of  hearing  layoff  notices  were  rescinded  as  to  five  individuals 

previously  served  with  Accusations.'  In  addition,  notices  to  respondents  Jenna  Daniels  and 
Melanie  Riley-Gonzalez,  which  had  previously  been  for  1.0  FTE  each,  were  adjusted  to  .7 
FTE  and  .5  FTE,  respectively. 

7. 

The  District  served  an  Accusation  and  Notice  of  Defense  form  on  Cassandra 
Walker.  These  and  other  documents  were  sent  by  the  District  via  certified  mail  on  April  4, 
2008.  Ms.  Walker  never  received  these  documents.  She  checked  to  see  if  any  of  her  mail 
had  been  held  for  her  at  the  post  office  and  it  had  not  been  so  held.  The  Accusation  and 
Notice  of  Defense  form  were  mailed  to  her  correct  address.  She  did  receive  a  layoff  notice 
from  the  District  that  was  sent  to  the  same  address  via  certified  mail,  and  she  had  filed  a 
request  for  hearing.  Ms.  Walker  was  made  aware  of  these  proceedings  and  participated. 
Notwithstanding  her  failure  to  file  a  notice  of  defense,  she  may  participate  as  a  party  to  these 
proceedings. 

8. 

The  Governing  Board’s  resolution  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of 
services  was  made  in  order  to  reduce  costs  without  reducing  core  subject  areas.  The  District 
has  projected  2008-09  revenue  reductions  to  approximate  $1.2  million.  The  District  also 
projects  cost  increases  in  excess  of  $1  million.  The  combination  of  decreased  revenues 
received  from  the  state  and  cost  increases  has  created a  total  budget  shortfall  of  $2,335,801. 
The  District’s  budget  reduction  target  is  higher  ($2,634,302)  to  account  for  deficits  in 
available  fund  balances.  All  this  comes  at  a  time  when  enrollment  may  increase,  with 
projected  average  daily  attendance  up  by  as  many  as  additional  595  students.  Although  each 
additional  student  adds  revenue  to  the  District,  the  amount  the  District  receives  per  student 
has  declined.  And  combined  with  rising  costs,  the  increased  student  enrollment  will  not 
improve  the  District’s  fiscal  situation. 

9. 

The  District  maintains  a  Certificated  Seniority  List  which  contains  employees’ 

seniority  dates  (first  date  of  paid  service),  status  as  tenured,  probationary  or  temporary,  and 
credentials  and  authorizations.  Status,  credential  and  authorization  data  are  obtained  from 
the  District’s  records  and  employees  are  given  the  opportunity  to  correct  errors  in  the 
seniority  list. 

Robert  Noyes  is  the  District’s  Assistant  Superintendent,  Personnel  Services.  He  and 
other  District  employees  were  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  technical  aspects  of  the 
layoff.  The  District  used  the  seniority  list  to  develop  a  proposed  layoff  list  of  the  least  senior 
employees  currently  assigned  in  the  various  services  being  reduced.  The  District  then 
determined  whether  these  employees  held  credentials  in  another  area  and  were  entitled  to 
“bump”  other  employees. 

 

'  These  individuals  were  Lacey  Anderson,  Laura  Mosbacher,  Lisa  Riddagh,  Molly  Sjordal  and  Susan  Wagner. 

  

August  17,  2007  New  Teacher  Orientation 

10. 

Nine  respondents  have  seniority  dates  of  August  20,  2007,  and  contend  that  it 

should  be  corrected  to  be  August  17,  2007,  to  account  for  their  attendance  at  a  new  teacher 
workshop  held  that  day,  from  8:00  a.m.  to  3:00  p.m.?  New  teachers  were  requested  to,  and 
understood  that  they  should  attend  this  workshop,  although  they  were  not  told  in  so  many 
words  that  their  attendance  was  mandatory.  They  were  neither  penalized  nor  disciplined  in 
any  way  for  failing  to  attend.  The  workshop  consisted  of  an  orientation  to  the  District  and 
introduction  to  key  personnel.  New  teachers  were  instructed  on  District  protocols  on  a  range 
of  matters  such  as  what  to  do  when  a  substitute  teacher  was  needed,  or  whom  to  go  to  for 
help  in  different  circumstances.  Time  was  also  set  aside  to  meet  with  the  Western  Placer 
Teachers  Association  (WPTA). 

Article  XV  of  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  between  the  District  and  WPTA 

makes  specific  reference  to  183  duty  days  that  District  teachers  are  required  to  be  in 
attendance  over  the  course  of  a  work  year,  and  184  duty  days  for  teachers  new  to  the  District. 
The  additional  duty  day  for  new  teachers  was  meant  to  be  the  date  set  aside  for  the  new 
teacher  workshop/orientation,  in  this  case  the  one  held  on  August  17,  2007.  New  teachers 
were  not  paid  an  additional  amount  for  attending  the  workshop,  presumably  because  it  was 
part  of  the  184  duty  days  encompassed  within  their  annual  salary. 

11. 

Under  the  terms  of  the  collective  bargaining  agreement,  duty  days  are  those 

which  teachers  are  required  to  be  in  attendance.  The  August  17,  2007  new  teacher  workshop 
constituted  a  duty  day.  Thus,  it  should  have  been  considered  by  the  District  to  be  the  date 
attending  teachers  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  District. 

e@ 

The  difficulty  presented  in  this  case  is  that  a  complete  list  of  attendees  at  the  August 
17,  2007  new  teacher  workshop  was  not  available  at  the  time  of  hearing.  It  is  likely  that  the 
large  majority  of  teachers  listed  by  the  District  as  having  an  August  20,  2007  seniority  date 
also  attended  the  workshop.  The  District  suggests  that  it  may  then  be  a  moot  issue.  The 
District  also  notes  that  all  teachers  were  afforded  an  opportunity  to  review  and  correct  their 
seniority  dates,  and  did  not  do  so.  There  was  no  evidence  that  earlier  adjustments  were  made 
to  account  for  attendance  at  the  workshop. 

A  sign-in  sheet  and  list  of  attendees  at  the  August  17  new  teacher  workshop  was 

found  and  submitted  on  May  12,  2008. 

12. 

The  seniority  date  for  the  nine  respondents  who  attended  the  new  teacher 

workshop  should  be  changed  August  20,  2007,  to  August  17,  2007.  The  District  should  also 
change  the  seniority  date  of  other  new  teachers  who  attended  the  workshop  from  August  20, 

?  The  nine  individuals  include:  Cynthia  Cygan,  Amanda  Fleshman,  Margaret  Hamrick,  Brenda  James,  Milagros 
Medina,  Melanie  Riley-Gonzalez,  Dayna  Swanson,  Julie  Walker  and  Amy  Williams.

2007,  to  August  17,  2007.>  After  these  adjustments  are  made,  the  District  should  rescind 
notices  to  the  degree  and  extent  that  the  August  17,  2007  seniority  date  places  respondents 
above  less  senior  teachers  who  were  not  given  layoff  notices. 

The  parties  agree  that  one  teacher,  Pamela  L.  Johnson,  who  did  not  attend  the  August 
17,  2007  workshop  and  who  therefore  retains  her  August  20  2007  seniority  date,  is  currently 
assigned  to  teach  using  her  multiple  subject  credential.  Ms.  Johnson  is  assigned  to  a  middle 
school  classroom,  but  is  teaching  two  cores  with  a  hanging  fifth  period  pursuant  to  Education 
Code  section  44258.1.  This  arrangement  allows  her  to  teach  using  her  multiple  subject 
credential.  Therefore,  the  District  has  retained  one  teacher  who  is  less  senior  to  teach  a  class 
that  eight  respondents  are  competent  and  credentialed  to  teach.  There  may  also  be  a  second 
teacher  besides  Ms.  Johnson  who  is  less  senior  to  teach  a  class  that  these  same  respondents 
are  competent  and  credentialed  to  teach. 

Respondents  contend  that  the  plain  language  of  Education  Code  section  44955 
requires  the  District  to  retain  all  eight  respondents  who  are  more  senior  to  Ms.  Johnson  since 
the  layoff  would  be  illegal  as  to  each  of  them.  However,  the  District  should  only  be  required 
to  rescind  one  layoff  notice,  two  if  a  second  teacher  is  identified,  by  applying  the 
“corresponding  number”  standard  articulated  in  Alexander  v.  Delano  Joint  Union  High 
School  District  (1983)  139  Cal.App.3d  567.  In  Alexander,  the  First  District  Court  of  Appeal 
found  that  “[b]ecause  at  least  some  of  the  persons  skipped  should  have  received  notices,  a 
corresponding  number  of  the  most  senior  of  the  employees  who  were  not  reemployed  must 
have  been  improperly  given  notices.”  (Jd.  at  p.  711.)  The  court  did  not  allow  for  the 
“domino  effect”  now  sought  by  respondents.  And  such  approach  is  rejected  here. 

The  District  should  instead  use  the  Governing  Board’s  tie  break  criteria  that  allows 

for  an  objective  lottery  to  determine  placement  on  the  seniority  list.  By  so  doing,  of  the  eight 
respondents  with  an  August  17,  2007  seniority  date,  only  one  would  be  retained  due  to  the 
retention  of  Ms.  Johnson,  more  if  other  teachers  are  later  identified. 

Teachers  Holding  District  Intern  or  University  Intern  Credentials  and  Who  Occupy 
Positions for  Which  Respondents  are  Competent  and  Credentialed 

13. 

The  District’s  Governing  Board  met  on  or  around  April  15,  2008,  and 

determined  at  that  time  to  release  four  interns,  three  holding  a  district  intern  credential,  and 

3  The  District  has  also  suggested  that  it  may  change  the  seniority  dates  of  new  teachers  who  did  not  attend  the  new 
teacher  workshop  to  August  17,  2007.  It  reasons  that  since  the  August  17,  2007  workshop  constituted  a  duty  day,  it 
should  be  considered  by  the  District  to  be  the  date  that  attending  and  non-attending  teachers  first  rendered  paid 
service  to  the  District.  The  District  notes  that  the  dictionary  meaning  of  “rendered”  includes  being  “made 
available.”  It  also  argues  that  because  a teacher  is  entitled  to  draw  compensation  when  a  teacher  does  not  report  to 
work  at  any  time  during  a  contracted  work  year  due  to  illness,  duty  days  should  likewise  be  calculated  back  to 
August  17,  2007.  District  seniority  has  precise  meaning  independent  from  laws  governing  leave  time,  and  the 
District’s  arguments  are  therefore  rejected.  Similarly,  the  District’s  argument  that  non-attending  teachers  were 
“made  available”  and  therefore  rendered  paid  service  is  not  persuasive. 
*  The  eight  respondents  are:  Dayna  Swanson,  Milagros  Medina,  Amy  Williams,  Brenda  K.  James,  Margaret 
Hamrick,  Amanda  Fleshman,  Heather  Donovan  and  Cynthia  Cygan. 

 

  

one  holding  a  university  intern  credential.*  They  were  assigned  to  teach  high  school  English 
(1.0  FTE),  high  school  biological  science  (1.0  FTE),  and  eighth  grade  mathematics  (2.0 
FTE).  None  of  these  four  classes  were  identified  or  included  as  part  of  the  particular  kinds  of 
services  to  be  reduced  or  discontinued  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  four  interns  were 
not  issued  layoff  notices  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  Thus,  the  District 
may  consider  these  vacated  positions  in  much  the  same  way  as  it  would  consider  other 
positively  assured  attrition. 

Respondents  suggest  it  is  first  necessary  to  find  that  the  four  interns  were 
probationary  employees  in  order  for  other  teachers  to  move  into  their  positions.  It  is  not 
clear  why  such a  finding  is  needed.  If  the  vacated  positions  are  not  slated  for  PKS 
reductions,  the  District  may  reassign  teachers  into  the  positions.  Still,  in  an  abundance  of 
caution,  there  was  no  evidence  presented  to  indicate  whether  these  teachers  were  serving 
under  temporary  employment  contracts  and  therefore  subject  to  annual  release.  For  example, 
there  was  no  evidence  that  any  of  the  four  were:  1)  replacing  a  teacher  on  leave  (Ed.  Code,  § 
44920);  2)  teaching  in  a  temporary  class  (Ed.  Code,  §  44919,  subd.  (a));  3)  teaching  in 
special  day  and  evening  adult  classes  (Ed.  Code,  §  44919,  subd.  (a));  4)  teaching  in  schools 
for  migratory  population  (Ed.  Code,  §  44919,  subd.  (b));  5)  serving  in  a  limited  assignment 
supervising  athletic  activities  (Ed.  Code,  §  44919,  subd.  (b));  or  6)  serving  in  any  other 
temporary  situations  identified  in  the  Education  Code. 

Appellate  courts  have  interpreted  the  temporary  classifications  narrowly,  allowing 
districts  to  classify  teachers  as  temporary  only  on  the  grounds  provided  in  the  Education 
Code.  Thus,  if  a  teacher  does  not  satisfy  the  statutory  grounds  for  a  temporary  classification, 
the  default  or  catchall  provision  of  Education  Code  section  44915  mandates  that  the  district 
classify  a  teacher  as  a  probationary  employee.  (Bakersfield  Elementary  Teachers 
Association  v.  Bakersfield  City  School  District  (2006)  145  Cal.App.4th  1260,  1279-1281; 
California  Teachers  Association  v.  Vallejo  City  Unified  School  District  (2007)  149 
Cal.App.4th  135,  146;  Vasquez  v.  Happy  Valley  Union  School  District  (2008)  159 
Cal.App.4th  969,  981-986.) 

With  this  in  mind,  the  District  is  required  to  make  assignments  and  reassignments  in 

such  a  manner  that  employees  shall  be  retained  to  render  any  service  which  their  seniority 
and  qualifications  entitle  them  to  render.  (Ed.  Code,  §  44955,  subd.  (c).)  And  this  includes 
potential  assignment  and  reassignment  into  the  positions  made  available  by  the  departure  of 
the  four  interns. 

14. 

Respondent  Jenna  Daniels  has  a  District  Seniority  date  of  August  29,  2007. 

She  was  noticed  for  layoff  due  to  the  reduction  of  K-5  Science  by  .7  FTE.  Ms.  Daniels  holds 
a  single  subject  credential  for  biological  sciences.  She  is  qualified  to  teach  the  high  school 

credential  for  mathematics.    

*  The  teachers  are:  David  Lynn  Foxworthy,  university  intern  with  a  single  subject  credential  for  biological  sciences; 
Jared  John  Gonsalves,  district  intern  with  a  single  subject  credential  for  mathematics;  Holli  Ann  Little,  district  intern 
with  a  single  subject  credential  for  English;  and  Lori  Janine  Schleppenbach,  district  intern  with  a  single  subject 

biological  sciences  class  previously  taught  by  David  Lynn  Foxworthy.  No  one  with  greater 
seniority  than  Jenna  Daniels  possesses  the  credentials  and  qualifications  to  move  into  the 
position.  This  may  lead  to  a  part-time  bumping  situation,  if  Ms.  Daniels  retains  .3  FTE  K-5 
and  takes  only  .7  FTE  high  school  biological  sciences.  It  is  a  matter  better  left  for  the 
District  to  work  out  with  Ms.  Daniels. 

15. 

Three  other  teachers  were  identified  as  having  credentials  that  would  allow 
them  to  be  reassigned  next  year  to  the  two  eighth  grade  mathematics  classes,  and  one  high 
school  English  class.  Sandra  K.  Beckman  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential  with  a 
supplementary  authorization  to  teach  mathematics  (K-9).  She  is  currently  in  an  elementary 
school  position.  Rene  McGrath  also  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential  with  a  supplementary 
authorization  to  teach  mathematics  (K-9).  She  is  currently  in  an  elementary  school  position 
at  Carlin  C.  Coppin  Elementary  School.  Were  Ms.  Beckman  and  Ms.  McGrath  to  be 
reassigned  to  teach  eighth  grade  mathematics,  two  of  respondent  elementary  school  teachers 
could  be  assigned  to  teach  their  classes.  Melanee  Ford  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential 
with  a  supplementary  authorization  to  teach  English.  If  she  were  reassigned  to  teach  high 
school  English,  one  of  respondent  elementary  school  teachers  could  be  assigned  to  teach  her 
class. 

The  District’s  release  of  the  four  interns  results  in  four  positions  into  which  teachers 

may  be  reassigned.  Respondent  Jenna  Daniels  may  be  reassigned  into  high  school  biological 
sciences  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

The  District  has  discretion  as  to  whether  additional  assignments  and  reassignments 
should  be  made  to  save  other  junior  teachers  named  as  respondents.  While  the  District  has 
an  affirmative  obligation  to  reassign  senior  teachers  who  are  losing  their  positions,  it  does 
not  have  the  same  obligation  to  reassign  senior  teachers  who  are  not  losing  their  positions  in 
an  effort  to  save  junior  teachers.  In  short,  the  District  cannot  be  compelled  to  engage  in 
inverse  bumping  and  to  reassign  Sandra  Beckman,  Rene  McGrath  and  Melanee  Ford  into  the 
positions  held  by  the  three  interns  in  order  to  save  respondent  elementary  school  teachers 
from  losing  their  positions. 

Other  Matters  Relating  to  Individual  Teachers 

16. 

Brenda  James  and  Dayna  Swanson  teach  kindergarten  classes  at  Twelve 
Bridges  and  Lincoln  Crossing  Elementary  Schools,  respectively.  They  both  attended  a 
Kindergarten  Workshop  on  August  15,  2007,  from  8:00  a.m.  to  noon  at  Twelve  Bridges 
Elementary  School.  All  district  kindergarten  teachers  were  invited  to  attend.  The  purpose 
was  to  “collaboratively  create  a  kindergarten  assessment  packet  and  rubric  to  use  to  assess 
students  district-wide.”  Ms.  Swanson  was  told  that  she  “needed  to  attend.”  It  appears  that 
another  teacher  stated  this  to  her.  This  particular  program  was  subject  to  the  District’s 
professional  development  “buy-back  hours”  program.  Both  employees  received  four  hours 
credit  for  their  participation  and  were  compensated  for  their  time.  Attendance  was  not 
mandatory.  Given  the  nature  of  this  particular  workshop,  Ms.  James  and  Ms.  Swanson  are 
not  entitled  to  change  their  seniority  date  based  upon  their  attendance  at  same. 

  

 

  

  

17. 

Milagros  Medina  is  an  elementary  school  teacher.  She  attended  a  six-hour 

GLAD  Summer  Planning  program  on  August  8,  2007.  This  was  a  program  designed  to 
develop  strategies  for  working  with  students  in  the  District’s  English  Language  Learner 
program.  Participation  in  this  program  was  not  mandatory.  Ms.  Medina  received 
professional  development  credit  (buy-back  hours)  for  her  attendance.  She  is  not  entitled  to 
change  her  seniority  date  based  upon  her  attendance  at  this  program.

18. 

Melanie  Riley  is  a  band  teacher  at  Lincoln  High  School.  She  holds  a  single 

subject  music  credential.  When  home  economics  was  reduced,  Cindy  Hagman  was 
reassigned  from  home  economics  into  Ms.  Riley’s  position.  Ms.  Hagman  holds a single 
subject  music  credential  with  a  CLAD.  Ms.  Hagman  is  also  more  senior  to  Ms.  Riley  and  is 
therefore  entitled  to  bump  into  her  position. 

Ms.  Riley  contests  application  of  any  tie-breaking  criteria  based  upon  her  not  having  a 

CLAD.  Ms.  Riley  finished  her  CLAD  coursework  in  January  2008,  and  has  submitted 
necessary  documentation  to  the  California  Commission  on  Teacher  Credentialing  (CTC). 
She  received  confirmation  from  CTC  that  her  application  is  pending  evaluation. 

Peggy  VanLengen  is  the  District’s  Personnel  Account  Technician.  In  mid-January 

2008,  she  contacted  Ms.  Riley  and  inquired  as  to  the  status  of  her  CLAD.  Ms.  Riley  advised 
her  that  she  would  be  done  with  the  course  by  the  end  of  the  month.  When  Ms.  Riley 
completed  the  course,  she  did  not  so  advise  the  District.  Ms.  Riley  believes  that  the  District 
should  credit  her  for  having  a  CLAD  pending.  The  District  has  done  so  for  others.  For 
example,  Melissa  Garcia  is  an  elementary  school  teacher  with  a  single  subject  music 
credential.  She  was  credited  with  having  a  “CLAD  pending”  and  is  still  taking  the  course 
toward  CLAD  certification,  the  test  for  which  will  be  given  in  June  2008.  Ms.  Riley  is 
obviously  ahead  of  her  and  should  also  be  credited  with  having  a  CLAD  pending  by  the 
District.  Although  employees  should  bear  the  responsibility  of  updating  their 
credentials/certifications  on  file  with  the  District,  this  is  an  instance  where  Ms.  Riley  was 
asked  by  the  District  in  mid-January  about  the  status  of  her  CLAD,  and  the  District  was  on 
notice  that  she  would  have  been  finished  with  her  CLAD  coursework  by  the  end  of  January 
2008. 

    

Elementary  School.  She  is  currently  enrolled  and  taking  course  work  toward  CLAD 
certification.  The  class  will  continue  through  May  2008,  and  the  test  will  be  given  in  June 
2008.  She  is  in  the  same  class  as  Melissa  Garcia  and  believes  she  also  should  be  given  status 
as  CLAD  pending.  There  is  no  evidence  that  she  advised  the  District  of  these  facts  prior  to 
March  15,  and  she  should  not  be  accorded  CLAD  pending  status  for  this  reason.

position  will  require  additional  certification  in  either  behavior  analysis  or  applied  behavior 
analysis.  Mr.  Kelley  holds  neither  of  these  additional  certifications.  He  also  notes  that  the 
CTC  does  not  list  either  of  these  certifications  on  its  website  and  he  questions  whether  they 
can  legitimately  be  required  for  this  position.  He  is  willing  to  pursue  specializations  if  he  is 
hired  into  the  position. 

The  District  has  a  need  for  a  counselor  to  work  with  autistic  children  and  who  can 

conduct  behavioral  assessments  for  this  population.  Eli  Gallup  is  the  District’s  Director  of 
Special  Education.  He  explained  the  reasoning  for  having  the  special  education  counselor 
hold  additional  certifications  in  either  behavior  analysis  or  applied  behavior  analysis.  In 
making  reassignments,  a  district  is  permitted  to  consider  the  qualifications  of  an  employee 
prior  to  making  such  reassignment.  The  District  has  articulated  its  rationale  for  not  offering 
Mr.  Kelley  the  special  education  counselor  position.  Mr.  Kelley  has  not  demonstrated  that 
he  is  otherwise  qualified  to  serve  in  that  position. 

21. 

The  District  applied  tie-breaking  criteria  as  between  Kimberly  Moss  and 

Teresa  Conroy  in  reducing  physical  education  by  1.5  FTE.  Both  have  the  same  seniority 
date.  Ms.  Moss  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential  with  CLAD  and  a  physical  education 
authorization.  Ms.  Conroy  holds  a  single  subject  credential  in  physical  education.  As  a 
result  of  application  of  tie-breaking  criteria,  Ms.  Conroy  is  deemed  “more  senior”  to  Ms. 
Moss.  The  single  subject  credential  “trumps”  the  authorization  for  physical  education.  Thus, 
Ms.  Moss  was  noticed  for  1.0  FTE,  and  Ms.  Conroy  for  the  remaining  .5  FTE. 

22. 

With  due  consideration  and  adjustments  made  for  the  matters  noted  above,  no 
permanent  or  probationary  certificated  employees  junior  to  respondents  are  being  retained  to 
perform  a  service  which  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  render.  Those 
certificated  employees  junior  to  respondents  being  retained  will  provide  services  which 
respondents  are  not  certificated  and  competent  to  perform. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

The  District  employees  receiving  notices  that  their  services  would  not  be 

required  next  year  have  all  rendered  services  to  the  District. 

2. 

All  notice  and  jurisdictional  requirements  set  forth  in  Education  Code  sections 

44949  and  44955  were  met.  The  notices  sent  to  respondents  indicated  the  statutory  basis  for 
the  reduction  of  services  and,  therefore,  were  sufficiently  detailed  to  provide  them  due  process. 
(San  Jose  Teachers  Association  v.  Allen  (1983)  144  Cal.App.3d  627;  Santa  Clara  Federation 
of  Teachers  v.  Governing  Board  (1981)  116  Cal.App.3d  831.)  The  description  of  services  to 
be  reduced,  both  in  the  Board  Resolution  and  in  the  notices,  adequately  describe  particular 
kinds  of  services.  (Zalac  v.  Ferndale  USD  (2002)  98  Cal.App.4th  838.  See,  also,  Degener  v. 
Governing  Board  (1977)  67  Cal.App.3d  689.) 

 

3. 

The  services  identified  in  Board  Resolution  No.  07-08.14  are  particular  kinds 

of  services  (PKS)  that  could  be  reduced  or  discontinued  under  Education  Code  section 
44955.  The  Governing  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  identified  services  was 
neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  and  was  a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion.  Cause  exists  to 
reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  due  to  the  reduction  and 
discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services.  Cause  for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of 
services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District’s  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of 
Education  Code  section  44949. 

e 

4. 

A  District  may  reduce  services  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section 
44955,  subdivision  (b),  “either  by  determining  that  a  certain  type  of  service  to  students  shall 
not,  thereafter,  be  performed  at  all  by  anyone,  or  it  may  ‘reduce  services’  by  determining  that 
proffered  services  shall  be  reduced  in  extent  because  fewer  employees  are  made  available  to 
deal  with  the  pupils  involved.”  (Rutherford  v.  Board  of  Trustees  (1976)  64  Cal.App.3d  167, 
178-179.)

Education  Code  section  44955  provides  in  pertinent  part:

e 

(b)  Whenever  in  any  school  year  ...  whenever  a  particular  kind 
of  service  is  to  be  reduced  or  discontinued  not  later  than  the 
beginning  of  the  following  school  year,  ...or  whenever  the 
amendment  of  state  law  requires  the  modification  of  curriculum, 
and  when  in  the  opinion  of  the  governing  board  of  the  district  it 
shall  have  become  necessary  by  reason  of  any  of  these 
conditions  to  decrease  the  number  of  permanent  employees  in 
the  district,  the  governing  board  may  terminate  the  services  of 
not  more  than  a  corresponding  percentage  of  the  certificated 
employees  of  the  district,  permanent  as  well  as  probationary,  at 
the  close  of  the  school  year.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  by 
statute,  the  services  of  no  permanent  employee  may  be 
terminated  under  the  provisions  of  this  section  while  any 
probationary  employee,  or  any  other  employee  with  less 
seniority,  is  retained  to  render  a  service  which  said  permanent 
employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render.

6. 

Education  Code  section  44955  provides  that  when  certificated  employees  face 

layoffs  due  to  reduction  or  elimination  of  PKS,  the  District  has  an  affirmative  obligation  to 
reassign  senior  teachers  who  are  losing  their  positions  into  positions  held  by junior  teachers, 
if  the  senior  teacher  has  both  the  credentials  and  competence  to  occupy  such  positions.  The 
intent  of  the  Legislation  is  clearly  to  prevent  Districts  from  laying  off  senior  teachers  while

@ 

retaining  junior  teachers.  Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (c)  provides  in 
pertinent  part: 

Services  of  such  employees  shall  be  terminated  in  the  inverse  of 
the  order  in  which  they  were  employed...  The  governing  board 
shall  make  assignments  and  reassignments  in  such  a  manner  that 
employees  shall  be  retained  to  render  any  service  which  their 
seniority  and  qualifications  entitle  them  to  render... 

7. 

As  set  forth  in  Factual  Findings  10  through  12,  the  seniority  date  for  the  nine 

respondents  who  attended  the  new  teacher  workshop  should  be  changed  from  August  20, 
2007,  to  August  17,  2007.  The  District  should  also  change  the  seniority  date  of  other  new 
teachers  who  attended  the  workshop  from  August  20,  2007,  to  August  17,  2007.  After  these 
adjustments  are  made,  the  District  should  rescind  notices  to  the  degree  and  extent  that  the 
August  17,  2007  seniority  date  places  respondents  above  less  senior  teachers  who  were  not 
given  layoff  notices  and  who  occupy  positions  for  which  respondents  are  credentialed  and 
competent. 

The  number  of  rescinded  notices  shall  be  determined  according  to  the  “corresponding 

number”  standard  contemplated  under  Alexander  v.  Delano  Joint  Union  High  School 
District,  supra,  139  Cal.App.3d  567.  The  District  is  required  to  rescind  at  least  one  layoff 
notice  since  the  August  17,  2007  seniority  date  places  eight  respondents  above  one  less 
senior  teacher,  Pam  Johnson,  who  was  not  given a  layoff  notice  and  who  occupies a  position 
for  which  respondents  are  credentialed  and  competent.  The  District  should  use  the 
Governing  Board’s  tie  break  criteria  that  includes  an  objective  lottery  to  ascertain  placement 
on  the  seniority  list  of  one  multiple  subject  teacher  among  the  eight  affected  respondents. 
Only  that  single  teacher  should  be  retained  as  an  employee  for  the  2008-09  school  year,  and 
more  should  additional  teachers  who  are  less  senior  be  identified.

As  set  forth  in  Factual  Findings  13  through  15,  the  District’s  release  of  the 

four  interns  results  in  four  positions  into  which  respondents  Jenna  Daniels  and  three  others 
may  be  reassigned  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  District  is  required  to  make 
assignments  and  reassignments  in  such  a  manner  that  employees  shall  be  retained  to  render 
any  service  which  their  seniority  and  qualifications  entitle  them  to  render.  (Ed.  Code,  § 
44955,  subd.  (c).)  This  includes  potential  assignment  and  reassignment  into  the  positions 
made  available  by  the  departure  of  the  four  interns.’  Respondent  Jenna  Daniels  should  be 

°  The  four  interns  were  not  found  to  be  temporary  employees.  (See  Finding  13.)  As  noted  earlier,  appellate  courts 
have  interpreted  the  temporary  classifications  narrowly,  allowing  districts  to  classify  teachers  as  temporary  only  on 
the  grounds  provided  in  the  Education  Code.  Thus,  if  a  teacher  does  not  satisfy  the  statutory  grounds  for  a 
temporary  classification,  the  default  or  catchall  provision  of  Education  Code  section  44915  mandates  that  the  district 
classify  a  teacher  as  a  probationary  employee.  (Bakersfield  Elementary  Teachers  Association  v.  Bakersfield  City 
School  District  (2006)  145  Cal.App.4th  1260,  1279-1281;  California  Teachers  Association  v.  Vallejo  City  Unified 
School  District  (2007)  149  Cal.App.4th  135,  146;  Vasquez  v.  Happy  Valley  Union  School  District  (2008)  159 
Cal.App.4th  969,  981-986.)

reassigned  into  high  school  biological  sciences  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  District 
has  discretion  as  to  the  other  three  positions.

As  set  forth  in  Factual  Findings  16  and  17,  the  seniority  dates  of  Brenda 

James,  Dayna  Swanson  and  Milagros  Medina  should  not  be  changed  on  account  of  their 
attendance  at  the  Kindergarten  Workshop  or  the  GLAD  Summer  Planning  Program. 
Participation  in  these  programs  was  not  mandatory  and  the  employees  received  professional 
development  credit  (buy-back  hours)  for  their  attendance.  They  are  not  entitled  to  change 
their  seniority  date  based  upon  attendance  at  these  programs. 

10. 

As  set  forth  in  Factual  Findings  18  and  19,  Melanie  Riley  should  be  credited 

with  CLAD  pending  status  in  any  application  of  tie-breaking  criteria.  However,  Amanda 
Fleshman  shall  not  be  so  credited. 

11. 

As  set  forth  in  Factual  Finding  20,  the  District  has  met  its  initial  obligation, 

under  Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (c),  to  make  a  determination  whether 
Thomas  Kelley’s  seniority  and  qualifications  entitle  him  to  be  reassigned  to  the  new  special 
education  counselor  position.  The  District  reasonably  decided  not  to  re-assign  Mr.  Kelley, 
based  upon  the  District’s  need  for  a  counselor  with  qualifications  related  to  behavior  analysis 
or  applied  behavior  analysis.  Mr.  Kelley  has  not  persuasively  rebutted  the  District’s  decision 
not  to  assign  him  to  this  position.  The  District  has  established  that  no  employee  junior  to  Mr. 
Kelley  is  being  retained  to  perform  services  which  Mr.  Kelley  is  competent  and  certificated 
to  render.
