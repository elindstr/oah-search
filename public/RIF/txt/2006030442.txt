SANTA  ANA  UNIFIED  SCHOOL  DISTRICT 
STATE  OF  CALIFORNIA 

In  the  Matter  of  the  Layoff/Accusation 
Against: 

OAH  NO.  L2006030442 

86  CERTIFICATED  EMPLOYEES, 

  

Respondents. 

PROPOSED  DECISION 

This  matter  came  on  regularly  for  hearing  before  Roy  W.  Hewitt,  Administrative 

Law  Judge  (ALJ),  at  Santa  Ana,  California  on  April  3,  2006. 

Keith  V.  Breon,  Esq.  of  the  Law  Offices  of  Breon  &  Schaeffer,  A  Professional 

Law  Corporation,  represented  the  Santa  Ana  Unified  School  District  (the  district). 

Marianne  Reinhold,  Esq.  of  Reich,  Adell,  Crost  &  Cvitan  represented  85  of  the 
86  certificated  employees  affected  by  the  proposed  layoffs  (respondents)  who  appeared 
at  the  hearing. 

The  remaining  respondent  of  the  86  certificated  employees  affected  by  the 

proposed  layoffs,  Mr.  Leo  Trevino  (respondent),  represented  himself. 

Oral  and  documentary  evidence  was  received  and  the  record  was  left  open  unul 

closing  arguments/briefs  (post-hearing  briefs)  could  be  submitted  by  the  parties.  The 
parties  had  until  5:00  p.m.  on  May  25,  2006  to  file  their  post-hearing  briefs.  The  post- 
hearing  briefs  were  received,  read  and  considered  and  this  matter  was  deemed  submitted 
on  May  25,  2006. 

FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

The  ALJ  makes  the  following  Factual  Findings: 

1, 

On  February  28,  2006,  the  Board  of  Education  of  the  District  (the 

Board)  adopted  a  resolution  recommending  a  reduction  in  particular  kinds  of  services 
provided  by  the  district  for  the  2006-2007  school  year  due  to  a  decline  in  the  average 
daily  attendance  in  the  district.  (Exhibit  B.)  The  resolution  called  for  a  reduction  in 
services  equaling  113  Full-Time  Equivalent  (FTE)  positions.  The  resolution  called 
for  the  following  reductions  in  Particular  Kinds  of  Services  (PKS):  “113  FTE  K-5 

 

elementary  classes”  due  to  the  fact  that  the  district  would  be  reducing  or  discontinuing 
the  current  levels  of  K-5  classes  based  on  “loss  of  student  enrollment.”  (Exhibit  B.) 

The  parties  do  not  dispute  the  fact  that  the  services  listed  above  are  PKS, 
which  may  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section 
44955. 

2. 

The  district's  and  the  Board’s  decisions  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the 

services  listed  in  Finding  1,  above,  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious;  rather,  it  is  due 
to  the  decline  in  average  daily  attendance  and  is  therefore  a  proper  exercise  of  the 
district's  and  the  Board’s  discretion(s). 

3, 

The  reduction  and  discontinuation  of  services  is  related  to  the  welfare 
of  the  District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of 
certificated  employees  as  determined  by  the  Board. 

4. 

All  respondents  affected  by  the  layoffs  received  written  notice,  on  or 

before  March  15,  2006,  notifying  them  that  the  Superintendent  of  the  district  had 
recommended  they  not  be  re-employed  in  the  2006-2007  school  year. 

5. 

Each  respondent  submitted  a  timely  request  for  a  hearing  to  determine 

if  cause  exists  for  not  re-employing  them  for  the  ensuing  year. 

6. 

On  March  10,  2006,  the  district's  Assistant  Superintendent,  on  behalf  of 

the  District,  timely  notified  respondents,  pursuant  to  California  Education  Code  | 
sections  44949  and  44955,  of  the  district’s  intent  not  to  reemploy  them  for  the 
upcoming  school  year.  That  same  date,  March  10,  2006,  respondents  were  also 
served  with  a  copy  of  the  Board’s  resolution  number  05/06-2643,  a  blank  “Request  for 
Hearing,”  and  other  related  materials. 

7. 

Subsequently,  on  March  17,  2006,  the  Accusation  and  related  materials 

were  served  on  each  respondent. 

Each  respondent  timely  submitted  a  Notice  of  Defense. 

Each  respondent  was  properly  noticed  of  the  date,  time  and  place  of  the 

instant  hearing.  Any  respondent  who  failed  to  appear  at  the  instant  hearing  was 
properly  noticed  of  the  hearing. 

All  prehearing jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met. 

As  of  the  date  of  hearing  the  number  of  certificated  employees  affected 

by  the  layoffs  was  reduced  to  87,  due  to  attrition  (retirements,  etc.). 

8. 

9, 

10. 

11. 

 

12. 

The  district  and  respondents  agreed  that  during  the  post-hearing 

briefing  time  the  district  would  check  its  records  and  reaffirm  its  determinations  of 
seniority.  As  a  result  of  the  records  check  one  of  the  respondents,  Walter  Valencia,  is 
no  longer  being  considered  for  layoff  and  respondent  Gary  Brooks  was  removed  from 
the  layoff  list,  thus  reducing  the  number  of  layoffs  to  86  FTE. 

. 

13, 

On  April  25,  2006,  the  district  drafted  a  revised  layotf  list.  The  parties 
stipulated  that  the  revised  list  would  be  identified  as  Joint  Exhibit  3,  The  parties  also 
stipulated  that  “Respondents’  Request  for  Seniority,  etc.,  Checking”  be  marked  as 
Joint  Exhibit  1,  the  “District’s  Response  to  Seniority,  etc.,  Questions”  be  marked  as 
Joint  Exhibit  2,  and  the  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  be  marked  as  Joint  Exhibit 
4,  The  Joint  Exhibits  were  so  marked  and  are  received  in  evidence. 

14. 

The  respondents  listed  on  Joint  Exhibit  3  with  Layoff  numbers  (LO#)  | 

through  86  are  the  individuals  currently  slated  for  potential  layoff. 

15.  |  The  respondents  identified  in  Joint  Exhibit  3  were  selected  for  notice  of 

layoff  pursuant  to  a  seniority  list  based  on  the  first  day  of  paid  service  of  each 
respondent.  The  respondents  were  ranked  for  layoff  in  the  inverse  order of their  date 
of  employment.  As  to  respondents  who  have  the  same  date  of  hire/employment,  the 
District  used  appropriate,  written,  tie-breaking criteria  to  rank  those  employees.

16. 

Certain  respondents  identified  in  Exhibit  3  question  the  dates  used  by 
the  Board  and  the  district  as  their  “Seniority  Date”.  Some  respondents  believe  they 
should  have  received  credit  for  the  time  they  worked  as  Pre-Interns,  under  emergency 
credentials,  and/or  as  Interns.

Credentials:

Respondents  who  worked  as  Interns: 

1. 

2. 

3, 

4, 

Brooks,  Rosalie  (Intern  date:  12/8/03;  Credential:  10/4/04; 
Seniority  date:  10/4/04) 
Cortez,  Andrea  (Intern  date:  7/13/01;  Credential:  6/17/04; 
Seniority  date:  7/26/04) 
Gomez,  Maria  Guadalupe  (Intern  date:  8/8/02; 
Credential:  9/16/03;  Seniority  date:  9/16/02) 
Pena,  Lorena  (Intern  date:  2/7/02;  Credential:  1/28/04; 
Seniority  date:  1/28/03). 

17. 

The  respondents  listed  in  Finding  16  did  not  receive  any  credit  for  the 

time  they  worked  under  their  emergency  credentials,  or  as  Pre-Interns.  Of  the  Interns, 
only  Gomez  and  Pena  received  credit  for  one  year  prior  service  as  interns,  The 
decision  whether  to  grant  credit  for  the  categories  listed  in  Finding  16  was  pursuant  to 
district  policy.  As  testified  to  by  the  former  Executive  Director  of  Human  Resources, 
individuals  working  under  a  Pre-Intern  credential  or  emergency  credential  were  not 
credited  for  that  work  in  calculating  seniority.  Instead,  they  were  given a  seniority 
date  based  on  the  first  date  of  paid  service  after  having  obtained  their  preliminary  or 
clear  credentials.  Interns  working  under  a  district  Intern  credential  or  a  University 
Intern  credential,  however,  were  supposed  to  be  given  credit  for  up  to  one  year  service 
under  the  intern  credentials,  provided  the  service  was  rendered  during  the  academic

year  immediately  preceding  the  date  upon  which  they  received  their  preliminary  or 
clear  credential.  This  did  not  happen  in  the  case  of  Brooks,  Rosalie  or  Cortez, 
Andrea. 

18. 

Two  respondents,  Edwards,  Teri  and  Rossano,  Cecelia,  hold  Learning 
Handicapped  (LH)  credentials.  They  received  layoff  notices  notwithstanding  the  fact 
that  there  are  teachers  holding  LH  credentials,  assigned  to  LH  programs,  with  less 
seniority. 

19. 

The  seniority  dates  for  certain  of  the  respondents,  who  worked  as  long- 

term  substitutes,  were  properly  determined  by  the  district:  Dozal,  Carrie;  Leibman, 
Seth;  Oriz,  Julie;  Pitman,  Marin;  Post,  Robin;  Tourgeman,  Tammy;  and  Yee,  Lindsay. 

20. 

In  respondents’  closing  brief,  the  following  respondents  contend  that 
they  are  entitled  to  earlier  seniority  dates  because  they  returned  to  service  within  39 
months  of  resigning:  Bola,  Marianne;  Brooks,  Gary;  Brown,  Sandra;  and  Jacobs, 
Linda.  However,  these  contentions  were  not  presented  during  the  evidentiary  hearing. 
Consequently,  the  district  was  deprived  of  the  ability  to  question  these  respondents 
and  present  other  relevant  evidence  concerning  this  issue.  Thus,  the  evidence 
presented  was  insufficient  to  establish  the  validity  of  these  respondents’  claims. 

21. 

In  respondents’  closing  brief,  certain  respondents  contend  that 

_ 

respondents  with  consents  for  Math  or  Science  should  not  have  been  skipped.  Again, 
evidence  concerning  these  contentions  was  not  presented  during  the  evidentiary 
hearing  and  support  for  these  contentions  is  lacking’. 

22. 

One  respondent,  Benavides,  Bertha,  testified  that  she  has  a 

Supplemental  Authorization  in  Spanish  and  that  she  can  teach  Spanish  classes  in 
grades  K-8.  Accordingly,  she  contends  that  she  should  be  assigned  to  a  Spanish  class 
and  not  be  subjected  to  layoff.  The  evidence  established,  however,  that  the  only 
Spanish  classes  currently  available  in  the  district  are  at  the  high  school  level.  Since 
high  school  Spanish  teachers  are  required  to  teach  students  in  grade  levels  10,  11,  and 
12,  respondent  Benavides’  Supplemental  Authorization  does  not  authorize  her  to 
teach  Spanish  in  the  available  Spanish  assignments. 

  
* 
It  bears  noting  that  the  failure  of  respondents  to  present  certain  theories  and  evidence  during  the 
evidentiary  hearing  is  through  no  fault  of  counsel  for  respondents.  It  was  clearly  established  during  the 
hearing  that  counsel  for  respondents  had  requested  that  respondents  contact  counsel  in  advance  of  the 
hearing  so  that  evidence  in  support  of  all  theories  could  be  presented.  The  response  to  counsel’s  notice  and 
request  was  minimal.  Accordingly,  counsel  for  respondents  was  forced  to  consult  with  certain  of  the 
respondents  during  the  course  of  the  hearing  and  counsel  put  forth  their  best  professional  efforts  to  address 
all  issues  brought  to  counsel’s  attention  during  the  hearing. 

 

23. 

Certain  respondents  contend  that  they  should  have  been  exempted  from 

layoff  because  they  would  have  obtained  “consent”  authorizations  to  teach 
Mathematics  and/or  Science  if  they  knew  about  them  and  the  “consent”  authorizations 
would  have  altered  their  current  layoff  situation  by  allowing  them  to  be  skipped. 
Ridill,  Bruce;  Diaz,  Pablo;  Collins,  Stephanine;  McCready,  Maria;  and  Ayoub, 
Lormar  testified  that  although  they  qualified  for  consents  to  teach  Math  or  Science 
they  did  not  currently  have  such  consents  because  they  were  not  aware  that  they  could 
have  applied  for  them.  The  evidence  established  that  teachers  in  the  district  with 
enough  units  to  qualify  for  consents  to  teach  Math  or  Science  must  first  be  selected  for 
the  Math  or  Science  teaching  assignment.  The  consents  then  require  approval  of  the 
Board  and  are  active  for  a  limited  term;  one-year.  Accordingly,  since  these 
respondents  do  not  have  current  “consents,”  they  were  properly  noticed  of  potential 
layoff. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1, 

Jurisdiction  for  the  instant  proceedings  exists  pursuant  to  Education 

Code  sections  44949  and  44955,  and  all  notices  and  other  requirements  of  those 
sections  have  been  provided,  as  required. 

2. 

The  services  listed  in  Factual  Finding  1  are  PKS  within  the  meaning  of 

Education  Code  section  44955. 

3. 

Based  on  the  Factual  Findings,  considered  in  their  entirety,  cause  exists 

to  reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  by  86  FTE  positions, 
due  to  a  decline  in  enrollment,  as  described  in  Factual  Finding  2. 

4. 

Cause  to  reduce  or  discontinue  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of 
the  District's  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949, 

5. 

The  district  properly  determined  that  respondents  who  initially  worked 
for  the  district  as  Pre-Interns  or  under  Emergency  Credentials  should  not  be  credited 
for  the  time  they  worked  as  Pre-Interns  or  under  their  Emergency  Credentials. 
Emergency  permit  or  Pre-intern  Credential  holders  are  unable  to  count  their  teaching 
time,  while  so  permitted  or  credentialed,  toward  seniority.  (See  Summerfield  v. 
Windsor  Unified  School  District  (2002)  95  Cal.App.  4""  1026.)  That  being  the  case,  it 
seems  equally  reasonable  to  hold  that  such  employees,  being  but  employees  on  a 
potentially  temporary  basis;  year-to-year,  cannot  amass  seniority  as  either 
probationary  or  permanent  certificated  employees  of  the  district,  absent  specific 
statutory  authority  enabling  them  to  “tack”  such  service.  No  such  authority  exists. 

 

As  stated  in  Santa  Barbara  Federation  of  Teachers  v.  Santa  Barbara 

High  School  District  (1977)  76  Cal.App.3d  223,  228:  “The  statutory  classification 
system...  is  both  complex  and  obscure;  several  sections  of  the  code  appear  to 
conflict  with  one  another.  At  the  core  of  the  classification  scheme  is  a  division  of 
teachers  into  four  basic  categories:  permanent,  probationary,  substitute  and 
temporary.”  But  the  code  is  not  consistent  in  its  use  of,  or  reference  to,  substitute  and 
temporary  employees.  For  example,  Education  Code  section  44915  provides  that 
“school  districts  shall  classify  as  probationary  employees,  those  persons...  who  have 
not  been  classified  as  permanent  employees  or  substitute  employees.”  No  mention  is 
made  of  those  who  have  been  classified  as  temporary  employees.  In  another  example, 
Education  Code  section  44917  seems  to  blur  the  categories  of  substitute  and 
temporary  employees. 

Making  sense  of  the  conflicting  Education  Code  sections  is  a  difficult 

process  and  cases  interpreting  the  Code  sections  provide  no  clear  and  consistent 
guidance.  However,  considering  the  limited-term  nature  of  the  employment  of 
emergency-permitted  teachers,  as  envisioned  by  Education  Code  section  44300,  it 
cannot  have  been  the  intent  of  the  Legislature  to  require  that  school  districts  afford 
probationary  status,  and  the  legal  rights  that  status  confers,  upon  teachers  working  for 
potentially  limited-terms.  Similarly,  it  cannot  have  been  the  intent  of  the  Legislature 
to  require  that  school  districts  afford  probationary  status,  and  the  legal  rights  that 
status  confers,  upon  Pre-interns,  individuals  who  have  not  yet  exhibited  the  minimum 
qualifications  to  hold  preliminary  or  clear  teaching  credentials.  Consequently,  the 
district  acted  properly  in  not  awarding  seniority  to  the  respondents  listed  in  Factual 
Finding  16  who  worked  as  Pre-Interns  or  with  Emergency  Credentials. 

6. 

The  two  respondents  listed  in  Factual  Finding  18;  Edwards,  Teri  and 

Rossano,  Ceclia,  shall  have  their  notices  rescinded. 

7. 

Two  respondents,  who  worked  as  Interns,  shall  have  their  seniority 

dates  changed  to  conform  to  the  district’s  policy  of  being  credited  for  up  to  one  year 
service  under  their  Intern  credentials  since  their  Intern  services  were  rendered  during 
the  academic  year  immediately  preceding  the  date  upon  which  they  received  their 
preliminary  or  clear  credentials.  (Finding  17.)  Brooks,  Rosalie’s  seniority  date  shal] 
be  changed  from  10/4/04  to  12/8/03  and  Cortez,  Andrea’s  seniority  date  shall  be 
changed  from  7/26/04  to  6/17/03.  The  current  layoff  list  anticipates  the  potential 
layoff  of  teachers  with  seniority  dates  between  January  20,  2003  and  November  29, 
2004.  Consequently,  the  change in  Brooks’  and  Cortez’  seniority  dates  do  not  exempt 
them  from  potential  layoff  as  members  of  the  list  of  84. 

8. 

Based  on  the  modifications  set  forth  in  Legal  Conclusions  6  and  7, 
above,  cause  exists  to  notify  the  remaining  respondents  listed  Joint  Exhibit  3  with 
LO#  1  through  86  that  their  services  will  not  be  needed  during  the  2006-2007  school 
year  due  to  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  PKS. 

   

ORDER 

WHEREFORE,  THE  FOLLOWING  ORDER  is  hereby  made: 

I. 

The  Accusation  is  sustained,  in  part.  The  District  may  notify  the 

following  respondents  that  their  services  will  not  be  needed  during  the  2006-2007 
school  year  due  to  decline  in  enrollment  and  the  resulting  need  to  reduce  or 
discontinue  PKS:
