General Findings Concerning Statutory Requirements

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Education Code sections 44949 and 449553 provide for two notices to be given

in connection with terminating certificated employees. The first notice, which will be
referred to as the Preliminary Layoff Notice, is given by the superintendent. It is given to the
governing board and to the employees the superintendent recommends for layoff. The
Preliminary Layoff Notice gives the board and the employees notice that the superintendent
recommends that those employees be laid off. The superintendent must give the Preliminary
Layoff Notice no later than March 15. There is no requirement that a governing board take
any action in March. But while it is unnecessary, governing boards usually adopt a
resolution ratifying the superintendent’s recommendations.

2.

The second notice is a notice of a governing board’s decision to terminate an
employee. That notice is provided for in Section 44955 and must be given before May 15.
That notice advises a teacher that the district will not require his or her services for the
ensuing school year. That notice will be referred to as a Termination Notice.

3.

In this case, not later than March 15, 2010, the superintendent notified the

governing board and the respondents that he recommended that the respondents not be
retained for the ensuing school year.

The Preliminary Layoff Notice stated the reasons for the recommendation.

The recommendation was not related to respondents’ competency.

A Preliminary Layoff Notice was delivered to each respondent, either by

personal delivery or by depositing the notice in the United States mail, registered, postage
prepaid, and addressed to respondent’s last known address.

4.

5.

6.

The Preliminary Layoff Notice advised each respondent as follows: He or she
had a right to a hearing. In order to obtain a hearing, he or she had to deliver a request for a
hearing in writing to the person sending the notice. The request had to be delivered by a
specified date, which was a date that was not less than seven days after the notice was

served.4 And the failure to request a hearing would constitute a waiver of the right to a
hearing.

7.

Respondents either timely filed written requests for a hearing or obtained a

waiver of their failure to file. An accusation was timely served on respondents. Respondents
were given notice that, if they were going to request a hearing, they were required to file a
notice of defense within five days after being served with the accusation.5 Respondents
either filed timely notices of defense or obtained a waiver of their failure to file. All
prehearing jurisdictional requirements were either met or waived.

8.

The governing board of the district resolved to reduce or discontinue particular
kinds of services. Within the meaning of Section 44955, the services are “particular kinds of
services” that can be reduced or discontinued. The decision to reduce or discontinue these
services was not arbitrary or capricious but constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

Services the District Intends to Reduce or Discontinue

9.

The governing board of the district determined that, because particular kinds

of services are to be reduced or discontinued, it is necessary to decrease the number of
permanent or probationary employees in the district.

10.

The governing board of the district passed three resolutions regarding the

particular kinds of services to be reduced or discontinued.

11.

One resolution concerned 4.00 FTE and was as follows:

Early Reading First Bilingual Family Literacy Specialist
Early Reading First Intervention Specialist

Total Full-Time Equivalent Reductions

1.00 FTE
3.00 FTE

4.00 FTE

4 Employees must be given at least seven days in which to file a request for a hearing.

Education Code section 44949, subdivision (b), provides that the final date for filing a
request for a hearing “shall not be less than seven days after the date on which the notice is
served upon the employee.”

5 Pursuant to Government Section 11506, a party on whom an accusation is served
must file a notice of defense in order to obtain a hearing. Education Code section 44949,
subdivision (c)(1), provides that, in teacher termination cases, the notice of defense must be
filed within five days after service of the accusation.

Tie-Breaking Criteria Based on the Current Needs of the District and Students

15.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (b), the governing board of the district

adopted criteria for determining the order of termination as among employees who first
rendered paid service on the same day. Section 44955, subdivision (b), requires a district to
adopt such criteria and provides that the criteria are to be based on “needs of the district and
the students . . . .”

16.

The district’s tie-breaking criteria are as follows:

The following rating system shall be applied in determining the
order of termination of certificated employees:

A. Total Number of Credentials, Subject Matter Authorizations and

Supplemental Authorizations

B. Credential Status (Clear, Preliminary, Intern, Permit)

C. Total Number of Years of Teaching Experience in the Fontana

Unified School District

D. Total Number of Verified Years of Teaching Experience post

Bachelor’s Degree

TIE-BREAKING PROCEDURE

In the event that common day hires have equal qualifications
based on application of the above criteria, the District will then
break ties by utilizing a lottery.

17.

In this case, the district did not apply tie-breaking criteria.

District Did Not Engage In Skipping

18.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), a district may deviate from

terminating employees in the order of seniority, i.e., a district may skip over teachers with a
particular qualification and terminate more senior teachers who do not possess that
qualification. In order to skip, a district must demonstrate a specific need for personnel to
teach a specific course or course of study or for personnel with a specialization in personnel
services or nursing. If the need concerns a course or course of study, the district may skip a
junior employee only if employees with more seniority do not possess the special training
and experience necessary to teach the course and only if the junior employee does possess
that special training and experience.

19.
skipping.

In this case, the governing board of the district chose not to engage in

Right to be Retained According to Seniority and Qualifications – Date of Hire

20.

Job security is not inherent in seniority. The Legislature chose to provide

teachers with limited job security according to their seniority.

21.

In this case no issues were raised concerning the accuracy of the district’s

seniority list.

Right to be Retained According to Seniority and Qualifications – (Bumping)

22.

The second paragraph of section 44955, subdivision (c), does not add to

teachers’ seniority rights. It does, however, make it clear that governing boards must make
assignments in such a way as to protect seniority rights. Employees must be retained to
render any service their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render. Thus, if a senior
teacher whose regular assignment is being eliminated is certificated and competent to teach a
junior teacher’s courses, the district must retain the senior teacher and reassign him or her to
render that service. This is commonly referred to as bumping. The district must either
reassign or terminate the junior employee.

23. William Cardosi, whose seniority date is August 30, 2007, teaches one of the

services being reduced and is subject to layoff. Megan Barnes, whose seniority date is
September 23, 2011, does not teach one of the services being reduced. Mr. Cardosi,
however, is qualified to fill Ms. Barnes’s position. Thus, Mr. Cardosi has a right to bump
into Ms. Barnes’s position, and he has elected to do that.

24. Ms. Barnes contends that there are other open positions for which Mr. Cardosi

is qualified and for which he could apply. Ms. Barnes contends that, because Mr. Cardosi
could apply for other open positions, he has no right to bump into her position. Ms. Barnes’s
contention is similar to the argument made in favor of inverse bumping, which had been
rejected.

6

25.

The second paragraph of section 44955, subdivision (c), speaks of the duty of

a school board to make assignments in such a manner that employees will be retained to
render any service “their seniority . . . [entitles] them to render.” (Italics added.) A teacher’s
entitlement to bump a junior teacher out of his or her assignment derives from the senior
teacher’s seniority. A teacher’s seniority does not entitle him or her to bump a more senior
teacher out of his or her assignment just because the more senior teacher could move into
some other position. Duax v. Kern Community College District (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 555,
concerned the seniority rights of teachers in community colleges. The bumping rights are
similar to those provided by the second paragraph of section 44955, subdivision (c). Mr.
Duax, a community college teacher who was being terminated, contended that the college
was required to bump a more senior teacher out of his position because Mr. Duax was
qualified to fill that position, and the more senior teacher had a right to move into a different
position. The court rejected Mr. Duax’s claim that he had a right to “inverse bumping.” The
court said the district’s “obligation to make assignments and reassignments . . . is limited to
attempting to place an employee who would otherwise be terminated in a position being held
by another employee with less seniority.” (Italics added.) (Duax, supra, 196 Cal.App.3d at
p. 568.)

26. Mr. Cardosi has a right to bump into the position held by the least senior social

studies teacher, and that is Ms. Barnes’s position. Ms. Barnes has no right to require the
district to place Mr. Cardosi in some other position and no right to require Mr. Cardosi to
apply for some other position.

27.

Gary Gonzalez, whose seniority date is August 18, 2010, teaches one of the

services being reduced and is subject to layoff. Ariana Mota, whose seniority date is January
23, 2012, does not teach one of the services being reduced. It is possible that Mr. Gonzalez
would be qualified to fill Ms. Mota’s position. Mr. Gonzalez, however, stipulated that he is
not to be considered as a candidate to bump into Ms. Mota’s position.

28.

The district seeks to retain five junior teachers in instructional support

positions and one junior teacher in a special school improvement grant (SIG) position while
terminating four senior teachers who contend that they are certificated and competent to
render the services the junior teachers render. Instructional support teachers do not have
classrooms and do not have students assigned to them. They provide support for other
teachers and can provide direct support to particular students.

29.

The district does not contend that the instructional support positions and the

SIG position satisfy the requirements for skipping, i.e., the district does not contend that they
concern “a specific course or course of study” within the terms of Code section 44955,
subdivision (d)(1). Indeed, it would be impossible to defend the proposition that the junior
teachers’ positions are “a specific course or course of study.”

30.

At the time the district decided not to serve preliminary layoff notices on the
junior teachers while serving notices on more senior teachers, the district did not review the
more senior teachers’ personnel files to determine whether they were competent to bump into

7

the junior teachers’ positions. At the hearing, however, the district contended that the more
senior teachers are not competent to bump into the junior teachers’ positions.

31. Mark W. McLaughlin is the district’s Director of Certified Human Resources.

Mr. McLaughlin testified as to why the district chose to retain the junior teachers. The
following is a paraphrased summary of part of his testimony: An instructional support
teacher needs to have certain skills and personality traits. He or she needs to be social, well
organized, and focused. He or she needs to be able to accept criticism, able to interact with
others without creating conflict, and able to act as a mentor to students. Not everyone is
capable of these things. An instructional support teacher needs to have experience in
analyzing student data. An instructional support teacher needs to be able to support teachers
and students in the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program. The
program has no curriculum; it focuses on organizational and study skills. I do not know
whether any of the senior teachers have AVID training.

32. Mr. McLaughlin acknowledged that one would hope that all teachers have had

experience in analyzing student data.

33.

In testifying regarding the junior teachers, Mr. McLaughlin emphasized the

training the district provided to them during the current school year and said, if we permitted
more senior teachers to bump into their positions, our instructional support program would
suffer a one-year setback.

34.

The district failed to prove that the senior teachers are not competent to render

the services the junior teachers are being retained to render.

35.

One of the junior teachers is Monica Heredia. This is Ms. Heredia’s first year

with the district. Mr. McLaughlin testified as to the services she is providing as an
instructional support teacher in a middle school, a school for students in the sixth through
eighth grades. Before this year, Ms. Heredia’s experience had been with students in the first
and second grades. Mr. McLaughlin testified that Ms. Heredia has the type of personality
one needs to support students and teachers, and her personality fits the dynamics of the
school. Mr. McLaughlin was not aware of Ms. Heredia’s having had any special training
before this year, but she has had substantial special training this year.

36.

One of the junior teachers is Mary Santini. This is Ms. Santini’s first year

with the district. She is working with ninth grade students. Before this year, Ms. Santini’s
experience had been with students in kindergarten through eighth grade. She is a reading
specialist and has taught in reading intervention programs. She has experience as an AVID
site team member. Mr. McLaughlin testified that, since Mary Santini has been here, she
would have had at least 12 to 16 hours of special training. Curtis Dison has a seniority date
of July 23, 2001. Mr. Dison is one of the senior teachers on whom the district served a
Preliminary Layoff Notice. This year, Mr. Dison is teaching in the same school in which Ms.
Santini is teaching. Mr. Dison testified that Ms. Santini teaches classes he taught before the
district asked him to take another assignment. Mr. Dison began this school year teaching

8

three periods of a special program for ninth grade students who have at least a 2.0 grade
point average. The program is known as FAST. When a computer teacher was given the
position of assistant principal, the district asked Mr. Dison to teach that teacher’s computer
classes. Ms. Santini was already teaching three FAST classes. The district assigned Mr.
Dison’s FAST classes to her. With that change of assignment, Ms. Santini teaches a full
schedule of FAST classes. Thus, the district seeks to terminate Mr. Dison while retaining
Ms. Santini to teach classes he taught – and if it were not for the computer teacher’s having
moved to the assistant principal position, Mr. Dison would still be teaching those classes.
The district failed to prove that Mr. Dison is not competent to render the service Ms. Santini
is being retained to render.

37.

One of the junior teachers is Donna Carlson. This is Ms. Carlson’s first year

with the district. Mr. McLaughlin testified as to the services she is providing as an
instructional support teacher in an elementary school. Ms. Carlson provides support for
students in a reading program for students who have learning disabilities or other conditions
that qualify them for special education services. Before coming to the district, Ms. Carlson
worked with special education students as an intervention behavior counselor, worked as a
literacy coach and worked as a reading instructional coach. This experience is relevant to the
work she does as an instructional support teacher.

38.

One of the junior teachers is Ledina Geeter. This is Ms. Geeter’s second year
with the district. Ms. Geeter works as an instructional support teacher in a high school Rapid
Credit Recovery program. Mr. McLaughlin testified that he did not know what that program
was but that it would involve supporting either students or teachers.

39.

One of the junior teachers is Abigail Querubin-Villareal. Ms. Querubin-
Villareal has a seniority date of November 12, 2008. Mr. McLaughlin testified that Ms.
Querubin-Villareal supports teachers who have a large number of English language learners
(ELL) in their classes. She also works in the district office helping to develop the district’s
ELL master plan and providing administrators with information about the ELL master plan.
Mr. McLaughlin testified that he did not know whether Ms. Querubin-Villareal has special
training.

40.

One of the junior teachers is Marcus Soward. This is Mr. Soward’s first year

with the district. Mr. Soward is not an instructional support teacher. He is working under
the SIG. He focuses on lesson design, curriculum mapping, pacing, remediation for students
who need intervention, and language development. Mr. Soward works with an outside
consulting company. McLaughlin was not aware of Mr. Soward’s having had any special
training before this year, but he has worked with the outside consulting company this year.

41. Matthew Johnson is one of the senior teachers on whom the district served a

Preliminary Layoff Notice. Mr. Johnson has a seniority date of September 7, 2010. Mr.
Johnson teaches 10th grade English. He provides remedial training to students who have
failed to pass a standardized English proficiency examination, the California High School
Exit Examination (CAHSEE). He tries to prepare those students to write an essay and

9

answer multiple choice questions. He uses writing benchmarks and provides practice
questions. Mr. Johnson testified that he could do the work Ms. Santini is doing and could do
the work Mr. Soward is doing. The district failed to prove that Mr. Johnson is not competent
to render the services Ms. Santini and Mr. Soward are being retained to render.

42. Michael Vedo is one of the senior teachers on whom the district served a

Preliminary Layoff Notice. Mr. Vedo has a seniority date of August 30, 2010. Mr. Vedo
teaches sophomore English. Like Mr. Johnson, he provides remedial training to students
who have failed to pass the CAHSEE. Also, Mr. Vedo has worked on a special team to
facilitate the use of a new textbook, and he has met with the outside consulting company
with which Mr. Soward works. Mr. Vedo testified that, while Mr. Soward has attended those
meetings, he has not participated in the discussions. The district failed to prove that Mr.
Vedo is not competent to render the services Mr. Soward is being retained to render.

43.

Gary Gonzalez is one of the senior teachers on whom the district served a
Preliminary Layoff Notice. Mr. Gonzalez has a seniority date of August 18, 2010. Mr.
Gonzalez works at Fontana High School. He teaches one class in leadership. The balance of
his time is devoted to his position as student activities director. Mr. Gonzalez has been
teaching since 1997. Before coming to Fontana, Mr. Gonzalez developed a program called
Building Competent Learners. He has not worked with an AVID program, but in developing
the Building Competent Learners program, he took ideas from AVID. The program he
developed focused on organization, budgeting one’s time, and study skills. Students were
taught such simple things as how to approach a teacher to ask for help. Mr. Gonzalez
testified that the program he developed was very similar to AVID. The district failed to
prove that Mr. Gonzalez is not competent to render the services the instructional support
teachers are being retained to render.

44.

Except with regard to Mr. Gonzalez, there is no question regarding

certification. That is, with regard to the other senior teachers, the district contends only that
they are not competent to render the services the junior teachers are being retained to render.
With regard to Mr. Gonzalez, however, Mr. McLaughlin testified that he could not bump into
one of the junior teacher’s positions because they have multiple subject credentials while Mr.
Gonzalez has a single subject credential in social science. Bumping, however, does not
depend on a senior teacher’s having the same certification a junior teacher has. The only
requirement is that the senior teacher is certificated to render the service the junior teacher is
being retained to render, and there was no evidence that a teacher with a single subject
credential in social science cannot serve as an instructional support teacher or in a SIG
position.

45.

From Mr. McLaughlin’s testimony it is clear that the district did not consider

the senior teachers’ bumping rights. What the district did, in effect, was to skip junior
teachers to whom the district has provided some special training. And the district, in effect,
skipped them in spite of the fact that they are not in positions that could qualify for skipping
pursuant to the requirements of Code section 44955, subdivision (d)(1). That is something
the district is not permitted to do.

10

46.

Evidence Code section 500 provides: “Except as otherwise provided by law, a

party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is
essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.” The district has the burden of
proving that it is justified in terminating the senior teachers. What the district’s evidence
shows is that – if Mr. Dison, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Vedo, and Mr. Johnson were put into the
instructional support positions or the SIG position – they probably would need at least 12 to
16 hours of special training during the first seven months of the school year. It is possible
that one or more of those gentlemen do not have the interpersonal skills necessary to
competently render the services required of an instructional support teacher, but the district
did not offer any evidence in support of that proposition. The district failed to prove that Mr.
Dison, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Vedo, and Mr. Johnson are not competent to bump into the
instructional support positions or the SIG position. Without proving that, the district may not
terminate them while retaining junior employees to render those services.

Mandated Services

47.

State and federal laws mandate that certain services be provided at or above
mandated levels. There was no evidence that the district is reducing those services below
mandated levels.

Summary of Findings Regarding Retention of Employees

48.

Pursuant to the district’s stipulation, the district shall rescind the Preliminary

Layoff Notices served on the respondents listed in Finding 14.

49.

The district shall not terminate Mr. Dison, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Vedo, or Mr.

Johnson.

50. With regard to respondents who are permanent employees, the district will not

be retaining any probationary employee to render a service that such a respondent is
certificated and competent to render.

51. With regard to respondents who are permanent employees, the district will not
be retaining any employee with less seniority than such a respondent has to render a service
that the respondent is certificated and competent to render.6

52. With regard to respondents who are either permanent or probationary
employees, the district will not be retaining any employee with less seniority than such a

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

General Conclusions

1.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Code sections 44949 and 44955. All

notice and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied.

2.

Within the terms of Code sections 44949 and 44955, the district has cause to
reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services and to give Termination Notices to certain
respondents. The cause relates solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils.

Bumping

3.

Code section 44955 concerns a reduction in the number of a school district’s
employees. Job security is not inherent in seniority. In Code section 44955, however, the
Legislature chose to provide teachers with limited job security according to their seniority.
Students and society, in general, benefit from the Legislature’s choice. If school districts
were permitted simply to choose which teachers not to rehire, one could expect some
teachers to be much more cautious in deciding what to discuss and what ideas to express. In
Board of Education v. Round Valley Teachers Association (1996) 13 Cal.4th 269, 278, the
Supreme Court quoted with approval from Turner v. Board of Trustees (1976) 16 Cal.3d
818. The Turner court noted various interests that are affected by rules regarding the hiring
and retention of teachers. The Court said, “Our school system is established not to provide
jobs for teachers but rather to educate the young.” (Turner, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 825.)
Students and society benefit from teachers’ willingness to promote critical discussions of
important – and sometimes unpopular – topics. It is primarily for the benefit of students that
the seniority rights provided in Code section 44955 must be protected.

4.

A teacher’s seniority rights are limited, generally, by what he or she is

certificated and competent to teach and by the services a school district chooses to offer.
Subject to these limitations, however, a teacher, generally, has a right to be terminated
according to his or her seniority.

5.

The second paragraph of section 44955, subdivision (c), requires governing

boards to make assignments in such a way as to protect seniority rights. Employees must be
retained to render any service their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render. Thus,

7 Section 44955, subdivision (c), provides seniority protection for both permanent and

probationary employees in terms of the services an employee’s “qualifications entitle [him
or her] to render.”

12

if a senior teacher whose regular assignment is being eliminated is certificated and competent
to render a service a junior teacher is rendering, the district must retain the senior teacher.

6.

By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 28 through 46, it is determined

that the district failed to prove that Mr. Dison, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Vedo, and Mr. Johnson are
not certificated and competent to render the services that junior employees are being retained
to render.

Cause Exists to Terminate Certain Respondents

7.

Except for those respondents whose notices the district has stipulated to

rescind and except for Mr. Dison, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Vedo, and Mr. Johnson, cause exists to
give notice to the respondents that their services will not be required for the ensuing school
year.
