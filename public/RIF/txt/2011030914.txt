Respondents.

PROPOSED DECISION

Administrative Law Judge Vallera J. Johnson, State of California, Office of
Administrative Hearings, heard this matter in Vista, California on April 19, 2011.

Melanie A. Peterson, Esq., Fagen, Friedman & Fulfrost, LLP, represented Myrna

Vallely. Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources.

Jon Y. Vanderpool, Esq., Tosdal, Levine, Smith, Steiner & Wax, represented

Respondents.

The matter was submitted on April 19, 2011.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED DECISION

The Board of Education of the Vista Unified School District determined to reduce or

discontinue particular kinds of services provided by teachers for budgetary reasons. The
decision was not related to the competency and/or dedication of the individuals whose
services are proposed to be reduced or eliminated.

District staff carried out the Board’s decision by using a selection process involving

review of credentials and seniority and breaking ties between/among employees with the
same first dates of paid service. The selection process was in accordance with the
requirements of the Education Code.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Respondents listed on Exhibit “A” (Respondents) are probationary or

permanent certificated employees of the Vista Unified School District (District).

2.

On March 10, 2011, the District’s Board adopted Resolution No. 11-64
reducing or eliminating particular kinds of services for the 2011-2012 school year and
establishing tie-breaker criteria.

3.

On March 11, 2011, Myrna Vallely, the District’s Assistant Superintendent
Human Resources (Assistant Superintendent), served Respondents with written notice that
she recommended not to re-employ them in the 2011-2012 school year. In addition, the
notice advised Respondents of the right to hearing and that a Request for Hearing must be
delivered to the District’s office no later than “ten (10) days from the date of this preliminary
notice”; failure to request a hearing in a timely manner would constitute waiver of the right
to a hearing; a Request for Hearing form was included among the documents served on
Respondents.

Respondents submitted a timely Request for Hearing to determine if there was

cause for not re-employing them for the ensuing school year.

On March 25, 2011, the Assistant Superintendent made and filed an

Accusation Against Certificated Employees. She served each individual who submitted a
Request for Hearing with an Accusation, Notice of Defense, Notice of Hearing and related
materials.

6.

The District considered all Respondents served with Accusations and

supporting documents entitled to a hearing regardless of whether Respondents filed Notices
of Defense.

4.

5.

7.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements were satisfied.

8.

Prior to conclusion of the hearing, the District rescinded layoff notices issued
to Respondents Valentina Mendoza-Benitez, Natalie Vasquez, Alexander Houck, Kimberly
Camplisson, Victoria Muedano, Mary Owen, Lance Parrow, Dennis Sosnowski, Brian
Underhill, Roland Arias and Michelle Martin.

9.

On March 10, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution No. 11-64 and thereby took

action to reduce or eliminate the following particular kinds of certificated services
commencing the 2011-2012 school year:

Foreign Language: French Service
Foreign Language: German Service

57.0

6.0

2.0
2.8
2.0
1.8
1.2

The proposed reductions totaled 76.8 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions.

10.

The District considered all positively assured attrition in determining the

actual number of final layoff notices to be delivered to its certificated employees.

11.

The Assistant Superintendent was responsible for implementing the technical

aspects of the layoff. She developed a seniority list for probationary and permanent
certificated staff that included, site, name of the certificated employee, first date of paid
service, status, assignment, credentials and subject description.

To assure the accuracy of information, the Assistant Superintendent notified
certificated employees of seniority date, credentials and other data on file with the District
and provided an opportunity for each certificated employee to challenge or update this
information. If an employee questioned the information, the Assistant Superintendent (or her
designee) researched the issue; if the employee’s requested change was substantiated, the
District records were modified.

The seniority date was based on the first date of paid service rendered in a

probationary position.1 A teacher hired as a probationary employee who worked as a
substitute or temporary employee for at least 75 percent of the school days during the
previous year and who had performed the duties normally required of a certificated employee
of the District was deemed to have served a complete school year as a probationary
employee if that individual was employed as a probationary employee for the following
school year. Said individual was entitled to have the earlier year counted as a year of
probationary service. The prior year was “tacked” on for seniority purposes but only one
year could be tacked.2

12.

A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a
continuing position that he/she is certificated and competent to fill. In doing so, the senior
employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who currently holds that position.
Lacy vs. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal. 3d 469.

13.

In compliance with Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), in order to

determine the order of termination of employees with the same seniority date, the Board
adopted “Tie Breaker Criteria”, to wit:

“1.

Scope of California credential (a regular credential, i.e., not an emergency
permit) which allows the employee to teach in a classroom; the person with
such a broader credential wins the tie.

2.

3.

4.

5.

6.

7.

If a tie still exists, the winner is that employee with the greater length of actual
paid service (number of work days) in a public California school district in
that other credential, within the last 10 years, other than as a day-to-day
substitute or intern.

If a tie still exists, the winner is that employee with the greater length of prior
paid service (number of work days) within any California public school
district, within the current assignment in a contract position (including
temporary contract) but not as a day-to-day substitute or intern.

If a tie still exists, the winner is that employee who possesses a doctorate
degree.

If a tie still exists, the winner is that employee who possesses a master’s
degree.

If a tie still exists, the winner is that employee with the earliest date of
conferral of the master’s or doctorate.

If a tie still exists, a lottery would occur, with a VTA3 representative being
invited to observe.”

14.

The District used the seniority list to develop a proposed order of layoff. In

determining who would be laid off for each kind of service reduced, the District counted the
number of reductions and determined the impact on incumbent staff in inverse order of
seniority. The District then checked the credentials of affected individuals and whether they
could displace or “bump” other employees.

Respondents Kathryn Stevens, Lanae Waldron and Allison Richtman4 each

challenged her seniority date on file with the District. Each testified that she has had one or
more prior temporary contracts with the District, and that the District released her at the
conclusion of the temporary contract. None of the foregoing Respondents offered evidence
to establish that the District improperly calculated her seniority date. Given the foregoing,
the seniority date on file with the District was proper for Respondents Kathryn Stevens,
Lanae Waldron and Allison Richtman.

16.

The District retained Kelly Sellstrom (Sellstrom).

Sellstrom has a seniority date of August 15, 2007, and holds a multiple subject
credential. For the 2010- 2011 school year, she is assigned as a resource teacher and literacy
coach5.

The District did not reduce or discontinue the service of resource teacher and/or
literacy coach nor did the District identify either as a service to be skipped and retained in the
PKS resolution.

The Assistant Superintendent established that the District has a need to retain
Sellstrom because she has demonstrated special skills and training to coordinate and
implement the District’s literacy programs (in elementary and middle schools) in a
standardized manner. The District has 17 literacy coaches. She holds a “master’s degree in
education – language, literacy” and has 10 years experience as a site literacy coach.

Respondents Michelle Jennings (Respondent Jennings) and Tracy Pochodowicz

(Respondent Pochodowicz) each contend that she improperly received a layoff notice
because she is certificated and competent to perform the services for which Sellstrom is
being retained. Respondents Jennings and Pochodowicz each holds a multiple subject
credential, and each has a seniority date of August 15, 2007. Respondents Jennings and
Pochodowicz each testified regarding her qualifications to perform the duties of a “lead”
coach.

Neither Respondent Jennings nor Respondent Pochodowicz was assigned as resource
teacher or literacy coach during the 2010-2011 school year. There is no evidence that either
has experience as a literacy coach or “lead” literacy coach; there is insufficient evidence to
establish that either is qualified to coordinate and implement some of the District’s literacy
programs.

Respondents Jenefer Grush, Meghann Larson and Sara Trejo have the same seniority

date, status and challenge as Respondent Allison Richtman. If called to testify their
testimony would have been the same as Respondent Allison Richtman’s. For the reasons
stated in Finding 15, there is no evidence that their seniority date was not properly
calculated.

Literacy coaches provide training and resources to teachers at school sites.

The District properly retained Sellstrom in that (1) the District did not identify
resource teacher or literacy coach as a particular kind of service to be reduced; (2) the
District established a need for a certificated teacher qualified to serve as “lead” literacy
coach; Sellstrom has special experience and education to perform this service. Insufficient
evidence was offered to establish that any employee with the same seniority date or more
senior to Sellstrom satisfies that competency for the position.

17.

Some Respondents had the same seniority date. According to the evidence in

the record, the District properly applied the tie breaker criteria to rank employees hired on
the same date; under these criteria the District properly retained certain employees while
Respondents were properly given notice that their services would no longer be required for
the ensuing school year.

18.

The services that the District proposed to reduce were “particular kinds of

services” that can be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section
44955. The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue these particular kinds of services was
not arbitrary or capricious but constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

19.

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related to the
welfare of the District and its pupils. The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the District as
determined by the Board.

20.

No certificated employee junior to any Respondent is retained to perform any

services that any Respondent is certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 and

44955. All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in these sections are satisfied.

A District may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not,
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford vs. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.)

3.

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the District

to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services. The cause for the reduction or
discontinuance of particular kinds of services is related solely to the welfare of the schools
and the pupils thereof.

4.

A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a

continuing position which he/she is certificated and competent to fill. In doing so, the senior
employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that position. (Lacy vs.
Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal. 3d 469.)

5.

The District has the discretion to determine whether teachers are certificated
and competent to hold the position for which said teachers have been skipped and retained.
(King v. Berkeley Unified School District (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 1016) Junior teachers may
be given retention priority over senior teachers if the junior teachers possess superior skills or
capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack. (Poppers v. Tamalpais Union High
School District (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 399; Santa Clara Federation of Teachers, Local 2393
v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified School District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831)

No employee with less seniority than any Respondent is being retained to

perform a service that any Respondent is certificated and competent to render.

All arguments not addressed herein are not supported by the evidence and/or

the law and therefore rejected.

ORDER

1.

The Accusation served on Respondents Valentina Mendoza-Benitez, Natalie
Vasquez, Alexander Houck, Kimberly Camplisson, Victoria Muedano, Mary Owen, Lance
Parrow, Dennis Sosnowski, Brian Underhill, Roland Arias and Michelle Martin is dismissed.

The Accusation on Respondents listed on Amended Exhibit “A” is sustained.

Notice shall be given to Respondents before May 15, 2011 that their services

will not be required for the 2011-2012 school year because of the reduction or
discontinuance of particular kinds of services.
