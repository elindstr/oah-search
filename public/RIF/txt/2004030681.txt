OAH  No.  N2004030681 

PROPOSED  DECISION 

Ann  Elizabeth  Sarli,  Administrative  Law  Judge,  Office  of  Administrative  Hearings, 

State  of  California,  heard  this  matter  on  April  15,  2004,  in  Selma,  California. 

Mary  Beth  de  Goede,  Attorney  at  Law,  represented  the  Selma  Unified  School 
District.  Wesely  Green,  of  Tuttle  and  McClosky  Attorneys  at  Law,  represented  respondents 
Cyndi  Guerra  and  Valita  Robison. 

The  matter  was  submitted  on  April  15,  2004. 

SUMMARY  OF  PROPOSED  DECISION 

The  Governing  Board  of  the  Selma  Unified  School  District  determined  to  reduce  or 

discontinue  particular  kinds  of  services  provided  by  teachers  and  other  certificated 
employees  (nurses)  for  budgetary  reasons.  The  decision  was  not  related  to  the  competency 
and  dedication  of  the  individuals  whose  services  are  proposed  to  be  reduced  or  eliminated. 

The  Board’s  resolution  to  reduce  two  School  Nurse  positions  relates  solely  to  the 

welfare  of  the  school  and  its  pupils,  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Education 
Code.  The  District  staff  carried  out  the  Board’s  decision  by  using  a  selection  process 
involving  review  of  credentials  and  seniority.  The  selection  process  was  in  accordance  with 
the  requirements  of  the  Education  Code.

FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

The  Selma  Unified  School  District  (“District”)  operates  eleven  elementary, 

junior  high  and  high  schools  for  approximately  5,800  students. 

2. 

Mark  Sutton  is  the  Assistant  Superintendent  of  the  District.  His  actions,  and 

the  actions  of  the  Board,  were  taken  in  their  official  capacities. 

3. 

Before  March  15,  2004,  the  District  personally  served  on  each  respondent  a 

written  notice  that  it  had  been  recommended  that  notice  be  given  to  respondents  pursuant  to 
Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  that  their  services  would  not  be  required  for  the 
next  school  year.  Each  written  notice  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation  and  noted 
that  the  Board  had  passed  Resolutions  reducing  the  certificated  staff  by  2.5  full-time 
equivalent  (“FTE”)  positions. 

Respondents,  timely  requested  in  writing  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for 

not  reemploying  them  for  the  ensuing  school  year. 

4. 

The  Superintendent  made  and  filed  Accusations  against  each  of  the  two 

employees  who  requested  a  hearing.  The  Accusations  with  required  accompanying 
documents  and  blank  Notices  of  Defense  were  timely  served  on  those  employees. 

5. 

Respondents  timely  filed  Notices  of  Defense.

Respondents  in  this  proceeding  are  permanent  certificated  employees  of  the 

7. 

On  March  9,  2004,  at  a  regular  meeting  of  the  District’s  Board  of  Trustees  (the 

Governing  Board),  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  was  given  notice  of  the 
Superintendent’s  recommendations  that  certificated  and  other  employees  holding  2.5  FTE 
positions  be  given  notice  that  their  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  next  school  year 
and  stating  the  reasons  for  that  recommendation. 

8. 

On  March  9,  2004,  the  Board  adopted  Resolution  No.  FY  04-34,  providing  for 

the  reduction  or  elimination  of  the  following  particular  kinds  of  services: 

2  FTE  School  Nurse  Positions 
.)  FTE  Adaptive  Physical  Education  Teacher 

9. 

The  District  has  a  current  budgetary  shortfall  of  approximately  1.5  million 

dollars.  The  District  also  anticipated  that  it  would  receive  less  money  from  the  State  for  the 
next  school  year.  The  District  determined  that  it  needed  to  employ  multiple  cost  cutting 
strategies  and  concluded  that  it  would  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the  students  to  make  budget 
cuts  in  areas  that  did  not  impact  classroom  instruction.  Thus,  the  Board  resolved  to  reduce 

  

   

nursing  services.  It  was  established  that  the  Board’s  resolution  to  eliminate  2  FTE  of  nursing 
services  was  made  in  order  to  balance  its  budget  for  the  welfare  of  students. 

10. 

The  District  maintains  a  seniority  list  which  contains  employees’  seniority 

dates  (first  date  of  paid  service),  current  assignments  and  locations,  advanced  degrees, 
credentials,  and  authorizations.  Credential  and  authorization  data  are  obtained  from  the 
District’s  records. 

11. 

Mr.  Sutton  and  other  District  employees  were  responsible  for  implementation 

of  the  technical  aspects  of  the  layoff.  To  assure  the  accuracy  of  seniority  dates  and  other 
data,  affected  employees  were  notified  of  the  District’s  records  of  their  first  dates  of  paid 
service  and  credentials.  Seniority  lists  were  posted  at  all  of  the  District’s  schools. 
Respondent,  Valita  Robison,  was  not  included  on  the  seniority  list.  However,  she  was 
advised  by  telephone  of  the  seniority  date  and  of  the  credentials  the  District  had  in  her 
personnel  file.  There  is  no  issue  concerning  the  validity  of  this  information.  Ms.  Robinson 
suffered  no  prejudice  as  a  result  of  her  name  being  omitted  from  the  seniority  list. 

12. 

The  District  used  the  seniority  list  to  develop  a  proposed  layoff  list  of  the  least 

senior  employees  currently  assigned  to  nursing  services.  The  two  least  senior  employees 
holding  the  Professional  Clear  School  Nurse  Services  Credential  were  respondents.  Neither 
respondent  held  credentials  which  would  authorize  her  to  provide  teaching  services  to  the 
District. 

The  District’s  decision  to  reduce  nursing  services  was  based  upon  the 

District’s  determination  that  it  could  comply  with  all  statutory  mandates  with  a  reduced 
nursing  staff.  After  reduction  of  the  nursing  staff  by  2  FTE,  the  District  will  have  2.6  FTE 
registered  nurses  and  1  FTE  licensed  vocational  nurse  on  its  staff. 

Respondents  contend  that  the  District’s  reduction  of  nursing  services  is  not  in 

the  best  interests  of  the  students,  and  that  the  District  is  reducing  nursing  services  to  the  point 
that  mandated  programs  will  be  affected.  Respondents  offered  evidence  of  the  numerous 
State  mandated  services  they  provide,  including,  among  other  services,  vision  and  hearing 
exams,  scoliosis  screening,  referrals  to  Children’s  Protective  Services,  Height  and  Weight 
measurements,  tuberculosis  testing,  and  processing  and  maintaining  student  health  records. 

Additionally,  nurses  provide  numerous  services  not  mandated  by  the  State,  but 
necessary  for  the  health  and  welfare  of  the  students.  These  services  include,  among  others, 
unscheduled  screenings  and  follow-ups,  first  aid,  administration  of  medications,  training  staff 
in  first  aid  and  medication  administration,  making  appointments  for  students  for  medical 
services,  color  vision  screening,  health  fairs,  counseling  of  teens,  community  outreach  and 
disaster  planning. 

. 

15.  |  Respondents  produced  evidence  that  California  School  Nursing  Organization 

recommends  a  ratio  of  one  nurse  to  every  seven  hundred  and  fifty  students.  In  the  ideal 
-economic  circumstances,  the  District  could  observe  this  ratio.  However,  there  is  no  State

14. 

13. 

    

mandated  ratio  of  students  to  registered  nurses.  And  the  District,  after  examination  of 
services  and  staff  allocations,  is  confident  that  the  remaining  nursing  staff  can  deliver  the 
mandated  services.  Additionally,  the  State  does  not  require  that  every  mandated  health 
service  be  provided  by  a  registered  nurse,  only  that  the  specified  services  be  provided. 
While  it  is  clear  that  the  nurses  who  remain  in  the  District  will  be  working  harder  due  to  the 
reduction  of  2  FTE  positions,  it  was  not  established  that  the  reduction  would  prevent  the 
District  from  providing  mandated  services. 

16. 

The  District  employees  receiving  notices  that  their  services  would  not  be 

required  next  year  have  all  rendered  valuable  services  to  the  District. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS  AND  DISCUSSION 

1. 

All  notice  and  jurisdictional  requirements  set  forth  in  Education  Code  sections 

44944  and  44945  were  met. 

2. 

The  services  identified  in  Board  Resolution  No.  FY  04-34  are  particular  kinds 
of  services  that  could  be  reduced  or  discontinued  under  section  44955.  The  Board’s  decision 
to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  identified  services  was  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  and  was 
a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion.  Cause  for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  services 
relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District’s  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  section 
44949, 

3. 

A  District  may  reduce  services  within  the  meaning  of  section  44955, 

subdivision  (b),  “either  by  determining  that  a  certain  type  of  service  to  students  shall  not, 
thereafter,  be  performed  at  all  by  anyone,  or  it  may  ‘reduce  services’  by  determining  that 
proffered  services  shall  be  reduced  in  extent  because  fewer  employees  are  made  available  to 
deal  with  the  pupils  involved.”  Rutherford  v.  Board  of  Trustees  (1976)  64  Cal.App.3d  167, 
178-179. 

4. 

An  existing  budget  shortfall  and  the  anticipation  of  receiving  less  money  from 

the  State  for  the  next  school  year  are  appropriate  bases  for  a  reduction  in  services  under 
section  44955.  As  stated  in  San  Jose  Teachers  Assn  v.  Allen  (1983)  144  Cal.App.3d  627, 
638-639,  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services  on  the  basis  of  financial  considerations 
is  authorized  under  that  section,  and,  “in  fact,  when  adverse  financial  circumstances  dictate  a 
reduction  in  certificated  staff,  section  44955  is  the  only  statutory  authority  available  to  school 
districts  to  effectuate  that  reduction.”  The  District  must  be  solvent  to  provide  educational 
services,  and  cost  savings  are  necessary  to  resolve  its  financial  crisis.  The  Board’s  decisions 
were  a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion. 

5. 

Cause  exists  to  reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  due 
to  the  reduction  and  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services.  Cause  for  the  reduction  or 
discontinuation  of  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District’s  schools  and  pupils 
within  the  meaning  of  section  44949.

No  junior  certificated  employee  is  scheduled  to  be  retained  to  perform  services 

which  a  more  senior  employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

7. 

A  senior  teacher  whose  position  is  discontinued  has  the  right  to  transfer  to  a 

continuing  position  which  he  or  she  is  certificated  and  competent  to  fill. 
In  doing  so,  the 
senior  employee  may  displace  or  “bump”  a  junior  employee  who  is  filling  that  position. 
Lacy  v.  Richmond  Unified  School  District  (1975)  13  Cal.3d  469.  Junior  teachers  may  be 
given  retention  priority  over  senior  teachers  if  the  junior  teachers  possess  superior  skills  or 
capabilities  which  their  more  senior  counterparts  lack.  Poppers  v.  Tamalpais  Union  High 
School  District  (1986)  184  Cal.  App.3d  399;  Santa  Clara  Federation  of  Teachers  v. 
Governing  Board  (1981)  116  Cal.App.3d  831.  Respondents  did  not  maintain  that  they  had 
the  right  to  “bump”  junior  employees,  and  as  the  least  senior  employees  providing  registered 
nursing  services,  they  were  not  entitled  to  bump  other  employees  providing  registered 
nursing  services. 

ORDER 

Notice  shall  be  given  to  respondents,  Cindi  Guerra  and  Valita  Robison,  (occupying 
2  Full-Time  Equivalent  School  Nurse  Positions)  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for 
the  2004-2005  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  and  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of 
services.

No  junior  certificated  employee  is  scheduled  to  be  retained  to  perform  services 

which  a  more  senior  employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

7. 

A  senior  teacher  whose  position  is  discontinued  has  the  right  to  transfer  to  a 

continuing  position  which  he  or  she  is  certificated  and  competent  to  fill. 
In  doing  so,  the 
senior  employee  may  displace  or  “bump”  a  junior  employee  who  is  filling  that  position. 
Lacy  v.  Richmond  Unified  School  District  (1975)  13  Cal.3d  469.  Junior  teachers  may  be 
given  retention  priority  over  senior  teachers  if  the  junior  teachers  possess  superior  skills  or 
capabilities  which  their  more  senior  counterparts  lack.  Poppers  v.  Tamalpais  Union  High 
School  District  (1986)  184  Cal.App.3d  399;  Santa  Clara  Federation  of  Teachers  v. 
Governing  Board  (1981)  116  Cal.App.3d  831.  Respondents  did  not  maintain  that  they  had 
the  right  to  “bump”  junior  employees,  and  as  the  least  senior  employees  providing  registered 
nursing  services,  they  were  not  entitled  to  bump  other  employees  providing  registered 
nursing  services. 

ORDER 

Notice  shall  be  given  to  respondents,  Cindi  Guerra  and  Valita  Robinson,  (occupying 

2  Full-Time  Equivalent  School  Nurse  Positions)  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for 
the  2004-2005  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  and  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of 
services.
