of  California,  heard  this  matter  on  April  11,  2007,  at  the  Quartz  Valley  School  District,  Fort 
Jones,  California. 

Joseph  C.  Kincade,  Attorney  at  Law,  represented  the  Quartz  Valley  Schoo]  District. 

K.  Thomas  Smith  Jr.,  Attorney  at  Law,  represented  Susan  Callaghan,  respondent. 

The  matter  was  submitted  on  April  11,  2007. 

SUMMARY  OF  PROPOSED  DECISION 

The  Governing  Board  of  the  Quartz  Valley  School  District  determined  to  reduce  or 

discontinue  a  particular  kind  of  service  provided  by  respondent.  The  decision  was  not 
related  to  the  competency  and  dedication  of  respondent,  but  rather  because  of  budgetary 
reasons. 

District’s  staff  carried  out  the  Board’s  decision  by  using  a  selection  process  involving 
review  of  credentials  and  seniority.  The  selection  process  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with 
the  requirements  of  the  Education  Code.

  

  

  

FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

The  Quartz  Valley  School  District  (the  District)  provides  services  to 

approximately  25  students.  Respondent  is  a  teacher  employed  by  the  District  who  also 
performs  some  administrative  tasks. 

2. 

James  Pindell  is  the  Interim  Superintendent  of  the  District.  On  January  8, 
2007,  he  prepared  a  “Notice  to  Governing  Board  of  Recommendation  Not  to  Reemploy 
Certificated  Employee.”  The  reason  for  Mr.  Pindell’s  recommendation  was  that  the  District 
employed  three  teachers,  including  respondent.  As  a  consequence  of  the  relatively  high 
teacher/student  ratio,  the  District  operated  at  an  $88,000  deficit  for  the  2006-2007  school 
year.  No  State  or  Federal  funding  is  available  to  pay  for,  or  to  partially  subsidize,  the  District 
for  the  costs  of  respondent’s  position.  For  budgetary  reasons,  and  in  consideration  of  the 
students’  welfare,  Mr.  Pindell  proposed  that  respondent  not  return  to  teach  for  the  following 
school  year.  The  Board  passed  a  Resolution  on  January  8,  2007,  resolving  to  reduce  its 
certificated  staff  by  one  Full  Time  Equivalent  (FTE)  position,  thus  eliminating  respondent’s 
position. 

3. 

On  January  9,  2007,  the  District  personally  served  respondent  with  written 

notice,  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955,  that  her  services  would  not  be 
required  for  the  2007-2008,  school  year. 

4. 

On  January  9,  2007,  respondent  signed  a  Request  for  Hearing  which  was 

received  by  District  on  January  12,  2007. 

5. 

On  January  26,  2007,  Mr.  Pindell  made  and  filed  an  Accusation  against 

respondent.  The  Notice  of  Accusation,  with  required  accompanying  documents  and  a  blank 
Notice  of  Defense  were  timely  served  on  respondent  on  January  26,  2007. 

6. 

On  January  29,  2007,  respondent  acknowledged  receipt  of  the  Notice  of 

Accusation  and  accompanying  documents,  and  timely  served  the  District  with  her  Notice  of 
Defense. 

7. 

The  Board’s  Resolution  addressed  a  particular  kind  of  service  that  it  had  the 

authority  to  reduce  or  discontinue  under  Education  Code  section  44955.  The  Board’s 
decision  to  reduce  one  FTE  was  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  and  was  a  proper  exercise  of 
its  discretion;  its  decision  was  based on  the  welfare of  the  District  and  its  pupils. 

8. 

The  District  maintains  a  Seniority  List  which  contains  employees’  seniority 

dates  (first  date  of  paid  service),  current  assignments  and  locations,  advanced  degrees, 
credentials,  and  authorizations.  Respondent  was  the  most  “junior”  of  the  three  teachers  on 
the  seniority  list,  the  nearest  “junior”  teacher  having  approximately  one  more  year  of 

seniority. 

 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

All  notice  and  jurisdictional  requirements  set  forth  in  Education  Code  sections 

44949  and  44955  were  met. 

2. 

A  District  may  reduce  services  within  the  meaning of section  44955, 

subdivision  (b),  “either  by  determining  that  a  certain  type  of  service  to  students  shall not, 
thereafter,  be  performed  at  all  by  anyone,  or  it  may  ‘reduce  services’  by  determining  that 
proffered  services  shall  be  reduced  in  extent  because  fewer  employees  are  made  available  to 
deal  with  the  pupils  involved.”  Rutherford  v.  Board of Trustees  (1976)  64  Cal.App.3d  167, 
178-179. 

. 

3. 

Cause  exists  to  reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District, 
Cause  for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the 
District's  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949, 

4, 

A  senior  teacher  whose  position  is  discontinued  has  the  right  to  transfer  to  a 
continuing  position  which  he  or  she  is  certificated  and  competent  to  fill. 
In  doing  so,  the 
senior  employee  may  displace  or  “bump”  a  junior  employee  who  is  filling  that  position. 
Lacy  v.  Richmond  Unified  School  District  (1975)  13  Cal.3d  469.  Junior  teachers  may  be 
given  retention  priority  over  senior  teachers  if  the  junior  teachers  possess  superior  skills  or 
capabilities  which  their  more  senior  counterparts  lack.  Poppers  v.  Tamalpais  Union  High 
School  District  (1986)  184  Cal.App.3d  399;  Santa  Clara  Federation  of Teachers,  Local 
2393,  v.  Governing  Board  of  Santa  Clara  Unified  School  District  (1981)  116  Cal.App.3d 
831.  No  employee  with  less  seniority  than  respondent  is  being  retained  by  District. 

5. 

At  hearing,  respondent  made  a  Motion  to  Dismiss,  based  on  the  District’s 

failure  to  comply  with  Education  Code  section  44955.  The  Motion  was  taken  under 
submission.  Based  on  the  above,  respondent’s  motion  is  denied.

the  2007-2008  Sch 1001  Year  because  of  the  reduction  and  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds 

of  services.
