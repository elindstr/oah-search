The  resolution  directed  the  district’s  superintendent,  or  his  designee,  to  initiate 

procedures  to  not  reemploy  the  equivalent  of  13.50  full-time  equivalent  certificated 
employees  of  the  district  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955. 

2. 

On  March  10,  2008,  District  Superintendent  Clifton  Anderson  sent  notice  to 

86  certificated  employees  of  his  recommendation  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or 
discontinued  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  Eleven of  those  employees  requested  a  hearing 
to  determine  if  there  was  cause  to  not  re-employ  them.  Five  of  those  employees  did  not  file  a 
notice  of  defense.  Prior  to  hearing,  the  district  withdrew  accusations  against  four  employees, 
Melinda  Bailey,  Kyri  Cox,  Stephen  Jones  and  Aletta  Sauer.  Two  employees  —  Jonathan  Dorr 
and  Patricia  Radenbaugh  ~  are  the  remaining  respondents  in  this  proceeding. 

3. 

The  parties  stipulated  that  the  district  has  complied  with  all  procedural 

requirements  of  Education  Code  section  44949  and  44955. 

 

4. 

The  board’s  decision  to  reduce  13.5  full-time  equivalent  positions  was  based 

on  a  combination  of  declining  enrollment  and  an  anticipated  ten  percent  loss  of  revenue  from 
the  State  of  California  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

5. 

Respondent  Jonathan  Dorr  holds  a  1.0  full-time  equivalent  high  school 

teaching  position.  On  the  district’s  seniority  list  his  credential  is  listed  as  “Internship  Single 
Subject  —  Industrial  &  Tech.  Ed.”.  Respondent  is  a  first  year  probationary  teacher  and  is  the 
most  junior  of all  district  employees. 

6. 

Respondent  Patricia  Radenbaugh,  R.N.,  holds  a  .5  full-time  equivalent  school 
nurse  position.  Radenbaugh  has a  seniority  date  of  August  26,  2005.  She is  junior  to  Robin 
Correll,  R.N.,  who  holds  a  .85  full-time  equivalent  school  nurse  position.  Under  the 
resolution,  Correll  will  be  reduced  to  a  .35  school  nurse  position  for  the  2008-2009  school 
year.  Respondent  Radenbaugh’s  .5  school  nurse  position  is  eliminated. 

7. 

The  district  is  providing  nursing  services  through  its  two  school  nurses  as  well 

as  by  contracting  for  nursing  services  (vision,  hearing  and  scoliosis  screening)  with  the 
Humboldt  County  Office  of  Education.  For  the  school  year  2008-2009,  the  district  will 
provide  nursing  services  through  Correll  and  by  again  contracting  with  the  Humboldt  County 
Office  of  Education.  Superintendent  Anderson  has  consulted  with  his  Director  of  Special 
Education.  He  believes  that  even  with  the  reduction  of  nursing  services,  the  district  will  be 
able  to  provide  all  nursing  services  mandated  for  special  education  students.  He  also  has 
determined  that  the  district  will  be  able  to  provide  all  required  vision,  hearing,  and  scoliosis 
screening.  (Ed.  Code,  §§  49452,  49452.5.)  In  the  event  that  the  district  cannot  provide 
sufficient  nursing  services,  it  will  increase  Correll’s  position. 

8. 

Radenbaugh  argues  that  the  district  will  not  be  able  to  provide  all  mandated 

nursing  services  for  2008-2009  school  year.  She  argues  that  she  and  Correll  are  already 
stretched  to  the  limit  in  covering  the  district’s  schools,  and  she  feels  compromised  in  the 
services  that  she  is  providing  to  students.  She  believes  that  the  needs  of  the  district’s 
students  compel  the  continuance  of  her  nursing  services. 

The  evidence  establishes  that  many  of  the  nursing  services  currently  being  offered  by 

the  district  to  its  students  are  not  mandated  services.  It  was  not  established  that  mandated 
services  are  being  reduced  below  the  level  required  by  law  by  reason  of  the  .5  FTE  reduction 
in  school  nursing  services.  With  respect  to  the  screening  services,  it  is  not  required  that  they 
be  provided  by  a  certificated  school  nurse.  Finally,  a  particular  kind  of  service  of  an 
employee  may  be  eliminated  even  if  the  service  continues  to  be  performed  or  provided  by  the 
district  in  a  different  manner.  (See  e.g.,  Campbell  Elementary  Teachers  Assn.,  Inc.  v.  Abbott 
(1978)  76  Cal.App.3d  796,  812;  accord  Gallup  v.  Board of Trustees  (1996)  41  Cal.App.4th 
1571,  1586-1587;  San  Jose  Teachers  Assn.  v.  Allen  (1983)  144  Cal.App.3d  627,  639-640.) 

9. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  in  seniority  to  respondents  is  being  retained 
by  the  district  to  perform  services  that  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  render.

  

  

10. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  is  related  to  the 

welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  for  this  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections 

44949  and  44955,  and  all  notices  and  other  requirements of  those  sections  have  been 
provided  as  required  by  law. 

2. 

Cause  exists  because  of  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services  pursuant 
to  Education  Code  section  44955  to  give  notice  to  respondents  that  their  services  will  not  be 
required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  cause  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the 
schools  and  its  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949. 

ORDER 

Notice  may  be  given  to  respondents  Jonathan  Dorr  and  Patricia  Radenbaugh  that  their 

services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  of 
particular  kinds of  services.
