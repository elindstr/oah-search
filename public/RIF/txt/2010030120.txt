to render.

“You are advised that you may request a hearing to determine if 
there is cause for not reemploying you for the 2010-2011 school year.  
For that purpose, we enclose a document entitled ‘Combination 
Request for Hearing and Notice of Defense’ for your use.  

 
Your completed Combination Request for Hearing and Notice 

of Defense must be delivered to Cheri Sanders Assistant 
Superintendent, Personnel Services on or before 4:00 p.m. on  
March 22, 2010.  (Exh. 4.)”

to determine if cause exists for not re-employing them for the ensuing year.

properly noticed of the date, time and place of the instant hearing.

The following concern was raised during the hearing: 

In connection with this concern, the evidence established the following: 

Respondents are certificated permanent or probationary employees of the 

Initially, the respondents who were affected by the 4.0 FTE reduction in the 

 
district. 
 
 
 
 
Music program were advised that they were being laid off due to the elimination of the music 
program.  Later, the respondents were informed that the music program is not going to be 
eliminated next year; rather, it will be redesigned, so that multi-subject credentialed teachers 
can provide the students with music programs.  
 
 
 
 
multi-subject credentialed teachers can teach blocks of music so that similar, but not 
identical, music programs can be made available to district students.  The district’s ability to 
alter the current music program and offer alternative music programs does not negate the 
district’s ability to lay-off the noticed music PKS respondents.  
 
 
probationary employee, or any permanent employee with less seniority, is being retained to 
render services which such permanent employee is certificated and competent to render. 
 
 
Subsequent to the action the board took on February 24, 2010, to reduce 
particular kinds of services by 82.0 FTE positions, the district continued to evaluate its 
personnel needs.  After taking into consideration positively assured attrition and the effects 
of a retirement incentive program, the district has elected to rescind the notices of

termination as to the following respondents:  Merrilee Ironside; April Kline; Judy Garrett; 
Natalie Phillips; and Katie Rossi. 
 
 
In addition to rescinding the notices, as set forth in Finding 16, above, the 
district agreed to modify the seniority list by changing Stephanie Clapper’s seniority date 
from 2/5/2007 to 1/8/2007 (this change does not alter her position on the reduction in force 
list).
