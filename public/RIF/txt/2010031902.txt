Trustees a recommendation that the District give notice that particular kinds of services 
(PKS) be reduced or eliminated by the District for the ensuing school year (2010-2011).  

On March 9, 2009, the District’s Governing Board adopted Resolution No. 09-
10-024.  The resolution recites that, pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, it 
has become necessary for the District to reduce or to eliminate, no later than the beginning of

15. 
position or services; 

16.

17.

18. 
 

Eliminate all Adult Education Hourly certificated positions.  

The resolution directed the District’s superintendent, or his designee, to initiate 

procedures not to reemploy the equivalent of 36.4 full-time equivalent (FTE) certificated 
employees of the District pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. 
 

3. 

The written preliminary notice to each respondent from the District’s 

Superintendent states legally sufficient reasons for the District’s Board’s intent to eliminate 
or reduce the course as taught by respondents.   
 

Respondents each timely requested in writing a hearing to determine whether 

or not cause exists for not reemploying them for the ensuing school year.  

On April 1, 2010, Gregg Haulk, made the Accusation in his official capacity of 

Superintendent for the Eureka City Schools District.   
 

6. 

District’s Superintendent timely served upon each respondent the Accusation, 

dated April 1, 2010, and related documents.  Each respondent filed timely a notice of 
defense.  
 

7. 

It was stipulated at the hearing that all of the jurisdictional requirements of 

California Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 have been met in this proceeding. 
 

8. 

Respondent Brooks Franklin is a full-time math teacher at Eureka High 

School.  He has a seniority date of August 28, 2000.  As a result of the 5.7 FTE reduction in 
math positions or services, his 1.0 FTE position is being eliminated.  Franklin does not 
believe that the District is retaining a sufficient number of math teachers in order to cover 
legally mandated math classes.  The teacher’s concerns are, at this time, speculative.  The 
District believes it has retained a sufficient number of teachers in order to meet the needs of 
the District based on its projected enrollment.  The enrollment number, however, is still in a 
state of flux.  Many additional decisions will need to be made by the board and the District 
before an accurate assessment of staffing needs can be made.  Because of the financial 

3 

 

 
 

uncertainties of the District, it cannot be said that the board’s decision to reduce or eliminate 
the service is either arbitrary or capricious.  (Campbell Elementary Teachers Assn. v. Abbott 
(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 808.) 

 
9. 

 
Adina Lawson is a full-time teacher in the Eureka City Schools District.  She 
has a seniority date of September 1, 1999.  Lawson’s current assignment is teaching Theater 
(a Fine Arts position) and Language Arts.  Lawson holds a 0.6 FTE Fine Arts position and 
0.4 FTE Language Arts position.  As a result of the 5.233 FTE reduction in 
visual/performing arts in grades K through 12, and the 5.0 FTE reduction in English 
language arts in grades 7-12, the District has eliminated her 1.0 FTE position.   
 

Lawson believes she has bumping rights as to a junior employee, Melinda French, in 
that Lawson’s degree authorizes her to teach Home and Hospital.  Lawson admitted she has 
never taught and has no experience in the Home and Hospital class.   

 
It was established at the hearing that Melinda French has seven years experience 
teaching and working in the Home and Hospital program.  During the 2009-2010 school year 
two teachers worked in the Home and Hospital program.  In 2010-2011 the most senior 
teacher in the Home and Hospital program is retiring.   

 
In the event French were not retained and Lawson bumped into French’s position, 
there would be no one in the class with any experience or training in Home and Hospital.  
Consequently, the District has withdrawn its layoff notice and retained French in her position 
of teaching Home and Hospital because of French’s special experience and training.  The 
evidence did not support that Lawson had the necessary experience and training to bump into 
French’s position and as such Lawson was not competent to bump French. 
 

10. 

Jennifer Dean-Mervinsky, Patricia Guerrero-Frazier, Brenda Smith, Daniel 
Holmes, Gwen Gastineau-Ayoob, Rebecca Baugh and respondents similarly situated, does 
not believe that the District is retaining a sufficient number of teachers in order to cover 
legally mandated classes such as English, science, math and social studies.   

 
Dean-Mervinsky believes that in the event the teachers are layed off pursuant to the 
Board’s resolution, the District will not be able to provide the mandated classes because all 
teachers are currently at full student capacity settings under the terms of the current contract 
with the District.1   

 
The teacher’s concerns are, at this time, speculative.  The District believes it has 

retained a sufficient number of teachers in order to meet the needs of the District based on 
its projected enrollment.  The enrollment number, however, is still in a state of flux.  Many 
additional decisions will need to be made by the board and the District before an accurate 

                                                 

1   As stated at the hearing, there is no jurisdiction in this proceeding as to the teachers’ contract 
with the District.

11. 

The District has withdrawn the layoff notices on the following certificated 

assessment of staffing needs can be made.  Because of the financial uncertainties of the 
District, it cannot be said that the board’s decision to reduce or eliminate the service is 
either arbitrary or capricious.  (Campbell Elementary Teachers Assn. v. Abbott (1978) 
76 Cal.App.3d 796, 808.) 
 
 
employees:  John Crandell, Sheri Jensen, Ken Pinkerton, Heidi Schlesiger, Jeanne Wilhelm 
and Melinda French. 
 
 
The adult education teachers Brenda Bertain, Carolyn Joyce and Catherine 
McNally did not file a notice requesting a hearing.  It is presumed these teachers are layed 
off. 
 

12. 

13. 

The services set forth above in Factual Finding 3, are particular kinds of 

services that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 
44955.   
 
14.  No permanent or probationary certificated employee with less seniority than 

respondents is being retained to provide a service for which respondents are credentialed and 
competent to render. 

The reduction or elimination of services is related to the welfare of the District 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to Education Code sections 

2. 

Cause exists because of the reduction of particular kinds of services pursuant 

44949 and 44955, and all notices and other requirements of those sections have been 
provided as required by law. 
 
 
to Education Code section 44955 to give notice to respondents that their services will be 
reduced or eliminated for the 2010-2011 school year.  The cause relates solely to the welfare 
of the schools and its pupils within the meaning of Education Code section 44949.
