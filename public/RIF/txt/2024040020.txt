FACTUAL FINDINGS 
1. At its meeting on February 7, 2024, the Board of Trustees (Board) of the 
West Contra Costa Unified School District (WCCUSD) adopted WCCUSD Resolution 
2324-50. This resolution declares WCCUSD’s intention at the end of the 2023–20242academic year to reduce certificated employee services as stated in the resolution, 
with the total amount of reduction equivalent to 51.1 full-time employees. 
2. At its meeting on March 6, 2024, the WCCUSD Board adopted WCCUSD
Resolution 2324-57. This resolution declares WCCUSD’s intention at the end of the 
2023–2024 academic year to reduce certificated employee services as stated in the 
resolution, with the total amount of reduction equivalent to 23.45 full-time employees. 
According to Resolution 2324-57, at the time of its adoption positions equivalent to 
6.6 full-time employees already were vacant. The resolution states that in addition to 
these vacant positions, WCCUSD will eliminate positions equivalent to 16.85 full-time 
employees. The reductions Resolution 2324-57 describes are in addition to the 
reductions described in Resolution 2324-50. 
3. Acting in her official capacity as WCCUSD’s Director of Human Resources, 
Certificated, complainant Sylvia Greenwood, Ed.D., gave timely notice in writing to 
numerous certificated WCCUSD employees that the WCCUSD Board proposed to 
release them from employment in accordance with Resolutions 2324-50 and 2324-57.
Some of these notices stated that WCCUSD proposed, in lieu of terminating these 
persons’ employment, to reassign the recipients to other positions for which they hold 
appropriate credentials and experience. 
4. Ten of the employees to whom Greenwood directed the notices 
described in Finding 3 timely requested hearings on their re-employment.1 They are: 
 Brian Jacobs 
 
1 One other employee made a late request for hearing, but did not appear. 3Benjamin Ley
Katherine Marroquin2
 Tigest Nealy 
 Erika Nelson 
 Kelly Reimer 
 Teresa Reyes 
 Pilar Romero 
 Lorena Soto 
 Hanna Tyler 
5. Camille Johnson, Ed.D., WCCUSD’s Interim Associate Superintendent for 
Human Resources, recommends that the WCCUSD Board release the respondents 
named in Finding 4 (as well as other employees who did not timely request hearings) 
from employment, after the 2023–2024 academic year, in the positions in which they 
have served during this academic year. Complainant and Dr. Johnson allege that 
WCCUSD must release these employees because WCCUSD has chosen to reduce or 
 
2 Complainant contends that her notice to Marroquin was in error, because the 
Education Code gives Marroquin no right to a hearing on her potential reassignment. 
In light of the matters stated in Finding 9, this decision assumes but does not find that 
Marroquin is a proper respondent in this matter.4eliminate services that they provide, or because other persons with greater seniority 
will displace them from their positions.
Agreements 
6. Before or during the hearing, complainant reached agreements with nine
respondents regarding their employment after the 2023–2024 academic year.
WITHDRAWALS OF CHALLENGES
7. Through counsel, respondents Benjamin Ley, Erika Nelson, and Lorena
Soto stated at the hearing that they withdraw their challenges to complainant’s 
proposal to discontinue their employment after the 2023–2024 academic year in the 
positions in which they have served this year, in reliance on assurances from 
complainant regarding their future employment rights.
REASSIGNMENT  
8. Through counsel, respondent Teresa Reyes confirmed her agreement to 
accept employment after the 2023–2024 academic year in a position different from the 
position in which she has served this academic year. In reliance on complainant’s 
representation that this different position would be available to her, respondent Reyes
presented no further challenge to her proposed release from her 2023–2024 position.
WITHDRAWALS OF NOTICES
9. Through counsel, complainant stated at the hearing that she would not 
recommend to the WCCUSD Board that it give final notices to Katherine Marroquin, 
Tigest Nealy, Kelly Reimer, Pilar Romero, and Hanna Tyler that WCCUSD will 
discontinue these respondents’ employment after the 2023–2024 academic year. In 5reliance on this statement, none of these respondents presented further information 
challenging her proposed release from employment. 
Challenge to Proposed Release or Reassignment 
10. As to respondent Brian Jacobs, this decision addresses all challenges he 
made to complainant’s proposal to release him from the position in which he has
served during the 2023–2024 academic year. Any contentions not specifically
addressed in this decision are found to be without merit and are rejected. To the 
extent that other challenges may have been possible but were not identified during
testimony or in oral or written argument, respondent has waived those challenges. 
11. WCCUSD classifies Jacobs’s position as “Instructional Support Reading 
ELD3 Coach.” Jacobs is the least senior employee in this classification.
12. Jacobs testified, credibly and without contradiction, that despite the 
reference to English learners in his position description, he does not work primarily 
with English learners. Rather, Jacobs assists educators at all of WCCUSD’s nine high 
schools in improving how they teach literacy among all students. He plans and delivers 
professional development programs for classroom educators, and also works with 
individual teachers to improve their teaching methods.
13. WCCUSD has funded Jacobs’s position with grant funds, which will expire 
at the end of the 2023–2024 academic year. WCCUSD has applied to renew these 
funds, and complainant anticipates that this application will succeed. Complainant has 
 
3 ELD stands for English Learning Development.6not yet received confirmation that the grant funds will be available for the 2024–2025 
academic year, however.
14. Complainant values Jacobs’s work and concurs with him that it benefits 
WCCUSD’s educators and students. If the grant funds described in Finding 13 become 
available, complainant intends to continue Jacobs in his current position. If they do 
not, complainant intends to reassign Jacobs to classroom teaching, for which he also is 
certificated and competent.
LEGAL CONCLUSIONS
1. Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 
and 44955. The pre-hearing notices and actions described in Findings 1 through 5 
satisfy these statutes’ requirements.
2. WCCUSD, through its Board, has discretion to reduce or eliminate 
particular kinds of services, in the best interests of WCCUSD and its students. The 
Board’s exercise of this discretion as stated in Resolutions 2324-50 and 2324-57 is not 
arbitrary or capricious, and is not an abuse of discretion.
Respondents Whose Positions Will Continue 
3. The matters stated in Findings 1 through 5 and 9 do not constitute cause 
under Education Code section 44949 and Resolutions 2324-50 and 2324-57 to give 
notice to respondents Katherine Marroquin, Tigest Nealy, Kelly Reimer, Pilar Romero, 
and Hanna Tyler that WCCUSD will not require their 2023–2024 academic year services 
after the 2023–2024 academic year. 7Respondents Whose Positions Will End
4. The matters stated in Legal Conclusions 1 and 2 and in Findings 7 and 8
constitute cause under Education Code section 44949 and Resolutions 2324-50 and 
2324-57 to give notice to respondents Benjamin Ley, Erika Nelson, Teresa Reyes, and 
Lorena Soto that WCCUSD will not require their 2023–2024 academic year services 
after the 2023–2024 academic year. Resolutions 2324-50 and 2324-57 confirm that the 
cause relates solely to the welfare of WCCUSD’s schools and of those schools’ pupils. 
5. In light of the matters stated in Finding 11, complainant does not 
propose that WCCUSD retain anyone less senior than Jacobs to provide the services 
that respondent Jacobs provided during the 2023–2024 academic year.
6. Education Code section 44955, subdivision (c), requires WCCUSD to give 
notice to Jacobs before May 15, 2024, as to whether he will continue in his current 
position for the next academic year. If the grant funds identified in Finding 13 become 
available, WCCUSD later may rescind this notice. The uncertainty over these funds 
described in Findings 13 and 14 is cause, however, in light of the statutory deadline, 
for WCCUSD to give such notice to Jacobs. 
7. The matters stated in Legal Conclusions 1, 2, and 6, and in Findings 10 
through 14 constitute cause under Education Code section 44949 and Resolutions 
2324-50 and 2324-57 to give notice to respondent Brian Jacobs that WCCUSD will not 
require his 2023–2024 academic year services after the 2023–2024 academic year. 
Resolutions 2324-50 and 2324-57 confirm that the cause relates solely to the welfare 
of WCCUSD’s schools and of those schools’ pupils. 8Potential Reassignment or Reemployment
8. If WCCUSD gives notices as described in Legal Conclusions 4 and 7,
those notices may require further notices regarding reassignment, or may create 
future contractual or statutory obligations for WCCUSD. Concerns over whether 
WCCUSD will respect or violate those obligations do not require resolution in this 
proceeding.
