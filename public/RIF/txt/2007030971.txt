Anderson. 

On  March  14,  2007,  written  notice  was  given  to  the  Governing  Board  of  the 

District,  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955,  of  the Superintendent’s 
recommendation  that  notice  be  given  respondents  that  his  or  her  services  would  not  be 
required  for  the  next  school  year  (2007-2008).  That  letter  stated  the  reasons  for  the 
recommendation. 

: 

5. 

Each  respondent,  in  writing,  requested  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause 

for  not  reemploying  him  or  her  for  the  next  school  year.

  

  

6. 

Cause  exists  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949  and  44955 

for  not  reemploying  respondents  for  the  next  school  year  because,  by  Resolution  of  the 
Governing  Board  adopted  on  March  8,  2007,  the  Governing  Board  determined  it  was 
necessary  to  reduce  or  eliminate  certain  particular  kinds  of  services  and  that  as  a  result  to 
those  reductions  or  eliminations  it  was  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated 
employees  of  the  District  to  the  extent  set  forth  in  the  Resolution  as  of  the  close  of  the 
current  school  year. 

The  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services  is  due  to  fewer  classes  being  needed  to 

serve  the  students. 

The  three  services  specifically  relevant  to  this  hearing  are: 

0.2  F.T.E.  —  English  teaching  position 
0.2  F.T.E. 
0.2F.T.E. 

Biological  Science  teaching  position 
Directed  Studies  —  Study  Skills  teaching  position 

7. 

Cause  for  not  reemploying  respondents  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the 
District  and  the  pupils  thereof  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 
44955. 

8. 

No  permanent  or  probationary  certificated  employee  of  the  District  having  less 

seniority  than  respondents  will  be  retained  to  render  a  service  which  respondents  are 
certificated,  competent  and  legally  entitled  to  render. 

Susan  Finan  teaches  three  periods  of  English,  one  period  of  directed  studies  in  law, 

and  an  elective  involving  the  school  newspaper.  Her  seniority  date  is  August  16,  2004.  She 
has  a  Preliminary  Multiple  Subject,  with  a  Supplementary  in  English  -  CLAD  credential. 
She  did  not  establish  by  competent  evidence  that  she  is  credentialed  or  qualified  to  teach 
math.  She  presently  is  a  1.0  F.T.E  employee.  Ms.  Finan  can  be  reduced  by  0.2  F.T.E  in 
English. 

. 

M.J.  Nelson  teaches  three  periods  of  seventh  grade  science  and  one  period  of  directed 

studies.  She  holds  a  Preliminary  Multiple  Subject  -  CLAD  credential.  She  is  a  0.8  F.T.E. 
employee.  She  shares  the  same  first  date  of  service  (August  23,  2005)  with  two  other 
certificated  employees:  Anne  Fox  and  John  Hayden.  Anne  Fox  teaches  fourth  grade  and 
John  Hayden  teaches  7/8  grade  math,  science  and  physical  education.  Mr.  Hayden  is  a  1.2 
F,T.E.  employee  and  is  being  reduced  0.2  F.T.E.  M.J.  Nelson  did  not  identify  any  0.8  F.T.E. 
positions  for  which  she  is  credentialed  and  qualified  to  teach.  The  district  is  not  required  to 
break-up  Ms.  Fox  or  Mr.  Hayden’s  assignment  to  accommodate  Ms.  Nelson.  Ms.  Nelson 
can  be  reduced  by  0.4  F.T.E.  in  Biological  Sciences  and  Directed  Studies. 

9. 

It  must  be  noted  that  the  District  has  not  adopted  or  applied  tie-breaking 

criteria  to  Nelson,  Fox  and  Hayden  or  other  certificated  employees  who  have  the  same  first

date  of  paid  service.  This  may  become  important  for  reemployment  rights.  It  is  suggested 
that  the  District  adopt  and  apply  tie-breaking  criteria  as  soon  as  possible.
