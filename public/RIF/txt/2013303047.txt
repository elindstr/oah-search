PROPOSED DECISION

Anthony P. DeMarco, Esq., represented the Fullerton Joint Union High School

District (District).

Carlos Perez, Esq., represented the nine Respondents (as listed on exhibit 3, page 2).
At the conclusion of the hearing, the District withdrew the Accusation against Respondents

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Edward D. Atkinson, Assistant Superintendent of the District, acting in his

official capacity, caused all pleadings, notices and other papers to be filed and served upon
each Respondent pursuant to the provisions of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.
All pre-hearing jurisdictional requirements were met.

2.

Respondents are employed by the District as permanent, probationary, intern,

pre-intern, emergency permitted, waiver, and/or temporary certificated employees of the
District.

3.

On March 5, 2013, pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, the

Governing Board of the District (Board) issued a Resolution which approved the
recommendation by the Superintendent that notice be given to Respondents that their
services will not be required for the ensuing school year and stating the reasons for that
recommendation

4. On March 13, 2013, Respondents were given written notice of the

recommendation that notice be given to them, pursuant to Education Code sections 44949
and 44955, that their services will not be required for the ensuing school year and stating the
reasons for that recommendation.

5.

It was established that cause exists, within the meaning of Education Code

sections 44949 and 44955, for not reemploying Respondents for the ensuing school year for
all of the reasons set forth below. The District has decided that particular kinds of services of
the District will be reduced or eliminated no later than the beginning of the 2013-2014 school
year.

6. The reduction or discontinuation of these particular kinds of services is related to

the welfare of the District and its pupils. Due to the reduction or discontinuation of
particular kinds of services, it is necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees
of the District as determined by the Board. This reduction is necessary because of budgetary
issues.

7. The Board decided that it is necessary to decrease the number of certificated
employees because of the reduction in services. These services are “particular kinds of
services” that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section
44955. The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue these particular kinds of services was
not arbitrary or capricious, but rather, constituted a proper exercise of discretion. The Board
is faced with a budget shortfall. A detailed list of the particular kinds of services to be
eliminated is stated in Exhibit 1, Resolution number 2012/13 #45, which is hereby
incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

8. The reduction or discontinuation of these particular kinds of services is related to
the welfare of the District and its pupils. The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds
of services is necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the District as
determined by the Board. This reduction is necessary because of budget reductions.

9. The Board properly considered all known attrition, resignations, retirements and

requests for transfer in determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices to be
delivered to its employees prior to March 15, 2013. (San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen
(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627 at 636).

10.

The District properly created and utilized its seniority list by determining the
first date of paid service of each certificated employee and properly utilized reasonable “tie-
breaker” criteria when necessary. No junior teacher has been improperly retained in place of
more senior teacher.

11.

None of the seven remaining Respondents presented any legal basis to

challenge their layoff.
