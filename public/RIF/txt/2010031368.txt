On  February  23,  2010,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  (Governing

2010-2011 school year:

The District expects to rescind layoff notices for those employees teaching 
 
English  Language  learners  pursuant  to  expiring  or  non-compliant  certificates,  representing  20 
FTE, if the employees obtain the requisite certification by August 1, 2010. 
 
 
On or about March 5, 2010, Superintendent Berg notified the Governing Board 
that he had recommended that notice be provided to Respondents that their services will not be 
required for the 2010-2011 school year due to the reduction of particular kinds of services. 
 
 
On or about March 5, 2010, Superintendent Berg provided notice to Respondents 
that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2010-2011  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of 
particular  kinds  of  services.  Respondents  timely  requested  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is 
cause for not reemploying them for the 2010-2011 school year.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met. 

The  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  is  neither 

The services set forth in factual finding number 3 are particular kinds of services 

On or about April 6, 2010, the District issued the Accusations, and served them 

 
on Respondents.  Respondents thereafter filed timely notices of defense.  
 
 
 
 
which may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code2 section 44955. 
 
 
arbitrary nor capricious but is rather a proper exercise of the District's discretion. 
 
 
The reduction or discontinuance of services set forth in factual finding number 3, 
in the context of the anticipated decline in revenue, is related to the welfare of the District and its 
pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  as 
determined by the Governing Board.  
 
 
On  February  23,  2009,  as  part  of  Resolution  09/10-31,  the  Governing 
Board adopted criteria to determine seniority among employees who first rendered paid service 
in  a  probationary  position  on  the  same  date  (tie-breaking  criteria).  Points  were  awarded  for 
satisfaction of the following criteria: multiple and single subject credentials; type of credential; 
additional subject authorizations; English Learner teaching certification; and specialized GATE 
certification.  The  criteria  are  reasonable  as  they  relate  to  the  skills  and  qualifications  of 
certificated employees.  
 
Respondent Lisa Dauer (Dauer) challenges application of the tie-breaking 
 
criteria.  She  has  a  seniority  date  of  August  7,  2006,  and  holds  a  multiple  subject  teaching 
credential.  She  seeks  to  add  points  for  having  changed  her  preliminary  credential  to  a  clear 
credential,  on  March  17,  2010,  which  change  was  retroactive  to  May  2008.  The  delay  in 
effectuating the change was the result of, at least in part, of receiving incorrect information from 
District  representatives.  However,  even  if  Respondent  Dauer  is  given  credit  for  the  clear 
credential, this would not affect the order of layoff, as senior teachers possessing multiple subject 
credentials were also laid off.  
 
 
Respondent Joanne Valenzuela (Valenzuela) holds a multiple subject credential. 
She  was  initially  hired  in  August  2004.  She  tendered  her  resignation  effective  the  end  of  the 
2005-2006 school year, which resignation was accepted by the Governing Board. However, at 
the start of the 2006-2008 school year, Respondent Valenzuela received a call from her former 
school  principal  who  offered  her  employment  as  a  substitute  teacher.  Respondent  Valenzuela 
returned to work at the start of the school year, and was given a new seniority date, August 7, 
2006. She taught in the same classroom for the entire 2006-2007 school year.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

2. 

1. 

4. 

Jurisdiction  for  the  subject  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  sections  44949  and 

The  services  listed  in  factual  finding  number  3  are  particular  kinds  of  services 

 
 
44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 7. 
 
 
within the meaning of section 44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 3 and 8.   
 
 
Cause  exists  under  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  District  to  reduce  or 
discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  set forth in factual finding number 3, which cause 
relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District's  schools  and  pupils,  by  reason  of  factual  finding 
numbers 1 through 13.  
 
 
Section  44955,  subdivision  (b),  provides,  in  pertinent  part:  “As  between 
employees who first rendered paid service on the same date, the governing board shall determine 
the order of termination solely on the basis of needs of the district and the students thereof. Upon 
the request of any employee whose order of termination is so determined, the governing body 
shall furnish in writing . . . a statement of the specific criteria used in determining the order of 
termination  and  the  application  of  the  criteria  in  ranking  each  employee  relative  to  other 
employees  in  the  group.  .  .  .”    (Emphasis  added.)  Thus,  in  the  instant  proceeding  the  relevant 
inquiry  is  the  order  of  termination  not  the  order  of  rehire.  Issues  pertaining  to  Respondents’ 
preferential rehiring rights are the subject of other statutory provisions, such as sections 44956 
and 44957. Inasmuch as the application of the tie-breaking criteria to Respondent Dauer did not 
impact  the  order  of  termination  of  any  Respondent,  it  is  not  necessary  to  decide  whether  the 
District correctly applied the criteria to assign a seniority date to her.  
 
 
Under  section  44848,  if  a  certificated  employee  voluntarily  resigns  and  is 
thereafter  reemployed,  her  seniority  date  is  the  reemployment  date.  Respondent  Valenzuela’s 
situation is governed by this statute, as she voluntarily resigned and was thereafter rehired. The 
fact that she was rehired at the start of the following school year does not change the fact that 
there was a break in service.  San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627 
(San  Jose)  did  not  address  the  scope  of  section  44848,  and  the  fact  that,  as  Respondent 
Valenzuela correctly points out, the teachers in San Jose, unlike her, had in fact been absent from 
work for portions of a school year does not alter the foregoing conclusion. Rather, the court in 
San Jose held that another section, 44931, which states that permanent employees retain certain 
employment rights despite a break in service, was subject to the limitations contained in section 
44848.  Accordingly, the District correctly calculated Respondent Valenzuela’s seniority date. 
 
Cause  exists  to  terminate  the  Respondents’  services  for  the  2010-2011  school 
year, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 13 and legal conclusion numbers 1 through
