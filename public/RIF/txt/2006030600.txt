FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1, 

Larry  Buchanan,  Ed.D.,  Superintendent  of  the  Del  Paso  Heights  School  District 
(District),  made  and  filed  in  his  official  capacity  an  Accusation  against  respondents  Houa  Lee, 
Jaquetta  Redd,  Vanmany  Southivilay,  Yia  Thao,  and  Cynthia  Torrez  (respondents). 

2. 

Respondents  are  each  permit  teachers  in  the  District’s  Head  Start  program  at 

Morey  Avenue  Preschool.   

  

3. 

As  a  result  of  a  $444,444  shortfall  in  the  District’s  Head  Start  program,  due,  in 
part,  to  under-enrollment,  and  advised  of  a  federally  mandated  one  percent  reduction  in  Head 
Start  funding  for  School  Year  2006  —  2007;  the  District  Governing  Board,  on  February  28, 
2006,  adopted  Resolution  2005-2006-18  reducing  or  discontinuing  services  in  the  District’s 
Head  Start  program  for  the  2006  —  2007  school  year;  and,  concomitantly,  decreasing  the 
number  of  District  permit  teachers  in  the  Head  Start  program  to  the  equivalent  of  8.0  full-time 
equivalent  (FTE)  positions. 
The  Board  further  directed  the  Superintendent  or  his  designee  to 
send  appropriate  notices  to  affected  District  employees. 

@ 

4, 

The  services  rendered  at  the  District’s  Morey  Avenue  Preschool  are  particular 
kinds  of  services  that  can  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code 
section  44955,  The  Governing  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  these  particular  kinds 
of  services  was  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  but  constituted  a  proper  exercise  of  discretion 
and  was  related  to  the  welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils.  Accordingly,  it  was  necessary  to 
decrease  the  number  of  District  permit  employees  as  determined  by  the  Board. 

. 

5. 

Prior  to  March  15,  2006,  a  Notice  of  Reduction  in  Force  was  delivered  to  eight 

District  Head  Start  program  permit  teachers,  including  respondents,  by  registered  mail.  The 
District  has  diligently  sought  to  reduce  the  impact  of  its  Governing  Board’s  reductions  on  its 
Head  Start  program  permit’  personnel.  Subsequent  events  have  reduced  the  number  of  Head 
Start  teachers  affected  by  this  action  to  the  five  respondents  (5.0  FTE).  The  notice  provided  to 
each  respondent  set  forth  that  each  respondent’s  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing 
school  year and  stating  the  reasons  for  the  récommendations,  pursuant  to  Education  Code 
sections  8366,'  44949,  and  44955.  Each  notice  set  forth  that  the  District’s  action  was  not 
related  to  each  respondent’s  performance  as  a  teacher.  The  notice  also  advised  each  respondent 
of  her  right  to  a  hearing,  that  each  respondent  had  to  deliver  her  request  for  a  hearing in writing 
by  March  23,  2006,  and  that  the  failure  to  request  a  hearing  would  constitute  the  waiver  of  a 
right  to  a  hearing. 

6. 

Each  respondent  requested  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  was  cause  for  not 
reemploying  her  for  the  ensuing  school  year.  One  respondent,  Houa  Lee,  claimed  that  her 
notice  from  the  District  did  not  arrive  until  “two  weeks  later.”  Ms.  Lee’s  notice  was 
addressed  to  155  Bell  Street,  Sacramento,  CA  95838.  Ms.  Lee  resides  at  155  Bell  Avenue, 
Sacramento,  CA  95838.  Although  she  did  not  receive  the  notice  until  March  27,  2006,  upon 
receiving  Ms.  Lee’s  request  for.a  hearing,  the  District  properly  provided  her  a  hearing. 

7. 

Aware  that  this  reduction  in  force  might  require  the  application  of  tie-breaker 
criteria  between  or  among  permit  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  District  on 
the  same  date,  the  Governing  Board  set  forth  criteria  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  District  and  its 
students.  To  that  end,  the  Board  directed:  “The  Superintendent  or  his  designee  shall  determine 
the  order  of  termination  or  reappointment  solely  on  the  basis  of  the  needs  of  the  District  and  the 
students  considering  one  of  [sic]  more  of  the  following  criteria:  1.  Bilingual  competency;  2. 

  

'  Education  Code  section  8366  provides,  in  pertinent  part:  “A  district  may  lay  off  an  employee  required  to  have  such 
a  permit  at  any  time  during  the  school  year  for  lack  of  work  or  lack  of  funds.”

e 

  

  

  

  

Possession  of  a  Bachelor  of Arts  degree;  3.  Amount  of  earned  Early  Childhood  Education 
(ECE)  units;  4.  Prior  long-term  substitute  or  temporary  teaching  experience  within  the  Del  Paso 
Heights  School  District;  and  5.  Evaluations.”  The  Board  also  expressly  provided:  “The 
Superintendent  or  his  designee  has  the  discretion  to  determine  which  criteria  is  most  relevant  to 
the  service  needs  of  the  District  and  students  in  each  tie-breaker  situation.” 

8. 

Associate  Superintendent  Patricia  H.  Hogan-Newsome  undertook,  at  the 

direction  of  the  Superintendent,  a  determination  of  which  criteria  to  apply  in  ascertaining  the 
District  and  its  students’  needs.  To  that  end,  she  balanced  the  District  and  its  students’  needs  in 
favor  of  teachers  who  possessed  a  baccalaureate  degree,  earned  ECE  units,  and  had  prior  long- 
term  substitute  or  temporary  teaching  experience  within  the  Del  Paso  Heights  School  District, 
and  discarded  bilingual  capacity  and  evaluations.  Applying  its  criteria,  the  District  arrived  at 
the  following  pertinent  seniority  list:

Sheila  D.  Kennedy

9. 

The  District  employs  teachers  senior  by  date  of  hire  to  respondents  who  are  both 

certificated  or  permitted  and  competent  to  render  the  particular  kinds  of  services  provided  by 
junior  certificated  or  permitted  employees,  including  respondents.  By  virtue  of  that  seniority, 
such  employees  have  the  right  to  “bump”  these  junior  employees,  including  respondents,  and 
retain  their  District  employment.* 

10. 

Respondents,  disputing  the  District’s  seniority  list,  largely  addressed  themselves 

to  the  tie-breaker  criteria  employed  by  the  District  and  contest  that  seniority  list  as  follows: 

Teacher

Regardless  of  when  a  permit  employee  “first  rendered  paid  service,”  the  District 

assigns  an  employee  date  of  seniority  consistent  with  her  California  Commission  on  Teacher 
Credentialing  (CTC)  permit’s  date  of  issuance.  The  District  readily  acknowledges: 

A. 

B. 

C. 

D. 

Ms.  Thao  first  commenced  employment  with  the  District  as  a  temporary 
pre-school  employee  on  September  10,  1997. 

Ms.  Lee  first  commenced  employment  with  the  District  as  a  temporary 
pre-school  employee  on  July  24,  1997. 

Ms.  Redd  first  commenced  employment  with  the  District  as  a  temporary 
pre-school  employee  on  July  24,  1997. 

Ms.  Torrez  first  commenced  employment  with  the  District  as  a  temporary 
pre-school  employee  on  July  24,  1997. 

However,  the  District  did  not  assign  a  date  of  seniority  to  these  respondents  until  their 
acquisition  of  a  CTC  permit.  Accordingly,  upon  receipt  of  Ms.  Thao’s  CTC  permit  with  an 
issuance  date  of  December  11,  2000,  a  District  date  of  seniority  of  December  11,  2000 
followed.  Similarly,  with  Ms.  Lee,  Ms.  Redd,  and  Ms.  Torrez,  the  District  followed  the  same 
practice. 

12. 

Respondents,  claiming  that  their  seniority  should  be  based  on  date  of  District 

hire—not  receipt  of  CTC  permit,  submit  that  the  District’s  Seniority  List  should  read  as  follows: 

Teacher

In  support  of  their  contention  that  the  District  Seniority  List  should  be  modified, 
respondents  relied  on  a  March  11,  2003  Temporary  Pre-Schools  Chart  which  depicted  the  dates 
of  hire  for  the  District’s  2002  —  2003  Morey  Avenue  Preschool  program.  Respondents 
selectively  employed  various  dates  of  hire  as  it  pertained  to  them,  without  equally  observing 
how  that  list,  which  includes  the  names  of  other  teachers,  would  apply  to  the  District’s  present 
Seniority  List.  Applying  the  same  criteria,  the  following  emerges: 

Sheila  D.  Kennedy 
Yia  Thao 
Kalyshia  Conway 
Vanmany  Southivilay 
Edith  Black 
Rala  Dayal

14. 

Ms.  Southivilay,  in  contrast  to  the  other  respondents,  submits  that  her  date  of 

seniority  should  be  adjusted  for  substitute  teaching  which  commenced  as  early  as  September  27, 
1999.  Ms.  Southivilay  errs.  Her  substitute  teaching  during  the  1999  —  2000  was  intermittent 
and  spread  among  various  absent  teachers.  It  is  clear  that  substitute  services  for  which  no 
expectation  of  exclusive  District  employment  was  demonstrated  or  met  75  percent  District 
rendered  services  does  not  function  to  modify  the  District’s  date  of  seniority  for  Ms. 
Southivilay.  Ms.  Southivilay’s  claim  is  summarily  dismissed.” 

15. 

Ms.  Southivilay  was  affected  by  the  Governing  Board’s  tie-breaker  criteria  and 

the  manner  in  which  select  criteria  were  applied,  in  large  part,  by  Ms.  Newsome.  Ms.  Dayal 
“bumped”  Ms.  Southivilay.  Ms.  Newsome,  in  conducting  her  analysis  of  both  women, 
observed  the  following: 

Ms.  Dayal 

Ms.  Southivilay 

Bachelor’s  Degree 
Long  Term  Sub/Temp 
ECE  Units 

Yes 
N/A 
32  units 

No 
N/A 
18  units 

16. 

Ms.  Southivilay  argues  that  Ms.  Newsome  failed  to  abide  by  the  Governing 

Board’s  criteria  by  not  considering  language  skills  or  evaluations.  Ms.  Southivilay  neglects  to 
observe  that  discretion  in  terms  of  which  criteria  were  to  be  employed  was  entrusted  to  the 
Superintendent  or  his  designee,  in  this  case,  Ms.  Newsome.  Regardless,  in  addressing  Ms. 

  

°  Education  Code  sections  44914  and  44918;  San  Jose  Teachers  Association  v.  Allen  (1983)  144  Cal.App.3d  627,  631 
and  642;  Ham  v.  Los  Angeles  City  High  School  Dist.  (1946)  74  Cal.App.2d  773;  and  Wood  v.  Los  Angeles  City  School 

Dist.  (1935)  6  Cal.App.2d  400.   

Southivilay’s  objections,  Ms.  Newsome  candidly  indicated  she  gave  no  weight  to  evaluations 
because  they  were  not  that  particularly  different.  While  Ms.  Southivilay  counters  that  her 
overall  evaluations  were  higher  than  Ms.  Dayal,  the  undersigned  concurs  with  Ms.  Newsome’s 
analysis.  Having  reviewed  the  various  evaluations,  the  differences,  while  marginally  favoring 
Ms.  Southivilay,  are  insufficiently  dispositive.  While  Ms.  Southivilay  possesses  English  — 
Laotian  language  skills,  she  admits  that  it  impacts  five  to  six  students.  Ms.  Newsome  observed 
that  Hmong,  Spanish,  and  Russian  were  language  skills  of  more  import  to  the  District.  A 
language  ability  that  is  limited  to  a  few  students,  combined  with  marginally  more  favorable 
evaluations,  does  not  offset  the  District’s  need  for  teaching  competency  as  reflected  by  a  focus 
on  additional  ECE  credits  and  a  bachelor’s  degree.®  Ms.  Southivilay’s  challenge  to  the 
District’s  tie-breaker  criteria  as  it  applied  to  her  fails.  Accordingly,  applying  the  criteria 
submitted  by  respondents  to  all  pertinent  parties,  the  following  seniority  list  emerges:

The  District  employs  some  permitted  employees  who  have  been  hired  after  some 

of  the  respondents,  The  District,  particularly  including  its  Twilight  Preschool  Program, 
demonstrated  a  specific  and  immediate  need  for  personnel  to  provide  services  authorized  by  a 
services  permit  or  credential  that  the  respondents,  although  having  more  seniority,  did  not 
possess. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

2. 

Jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  8366, 

44949,  and  44955,  and  as  set  forth  in  Findings  1  through  6. 

A  school  district  may  consider  its  financial  circumstances  in  deciding  whether 

to  reduce  or  discontinue  a  particular  kind  of  service.  San  Jose,  supra,  144  Cal.App.3d  at 
p.639. 

  

°  No  evidence  was  presented  whether  Ms.  Dayal  does  or  does  not  possess  bilingual  language  skills. 
”  Ms.  Torrez  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  bilingual  capacity  in  Spanish,  a  language  common  to  a  number  of  District 
pupils  in  its  Head  Start  program.  Applying  the  District’s  criteria  vis-a-vis  Ms.  Lee,  Ms.  Redd,  and  Ms.  Southivilay, 
and  in  the  absence  of  other  evidence,  Ms.  Torrez  emerges  as  more  qualified  for  seniority  determination. 

     

   

3. 

Under  the  statutory  scheme,  junior  teachers  may  be  given  retention  priority 
over  more  senior  teachers  when  the  junior  teachers  possess  superior  skills  or  capabilities 
which  their  more  senior  counterparts  lack.®  In  addition,  under  the  same  statutory  scheme,  a 
senior  employee  whose  position  is  discontinued  has  the  right  to  transfer  to  a  continuing 
position  he  or  she  is  certificated  and  competent  to  fill,  and  in  so  doing  may  displace  or 
“bump”  a  junior  employee.’ 

4, 

The  District  Governing  Board  must  determine  the  order  of  termination  solely 

on  the  basis  of  needs  of  the  District  and  its  pupils.'°  However,  “a  school  district  cannot 
target  for  reduction  the  services  of  a  particular  employee  in  disregard  of  his  or  her  seniority 
rights.”''  Admittedly,  an  administrative  proceeding  need  not  “be  conducted  according  to 
technical  rules  relating  to  evidence  and  witnesses.”'* 
In  balancing  the  parties’  respective 
evidence,  the  undersigned  applied,  in  part,  criteria  set  forth  at  Evidence  Code  sections  412," 
413,'*  500,'>  780,'°  786,'”  790'8  and  791!?  in  ascertaining  the  relative  convincing  force  of 
evidence.

Houa  Lee  claims  that  the  late  receipt  of  her  notice  from  the  District  should 
invalidate  its  applicability  to  her.  She  errs.  Although  the  District  received  Ms. 
Lee’s  request  for  a  hearing  late,  the  District  properly  provided  her  a  hearing.” 
Indeed,  Education  Code  section  44949,  subdivision  (c)(3)  states,  in  pertinent 
part:  “Nonsubstantive  procedural  errors  committed  by  the  school  district  or 
governing  board  of  the  school  district  shall  not  constitute  cause  for  dismissing 
the  charges  unless  the  errors  are  prejudicial  errors.”  It  cannot  be  said  that  Ms. 
Lee  has  suffered  prejudicial  error.”!  Ms.  Lee’s  claim  is  dismissed. 

It  is  undisputed  that  respondents’  dates  of  hire  are  distinctly  at  variance  with  their 
respective  seniority  dates.  Respondents,  unsurprisingly,  argue  that  their  seniority 
should  be  based  on  their  respective  dates  of  hire.  The  District,  in  contrast, 
responds  that  the  services  rendered  by  respondents  between  their  respective  dates 
of  hire  and  dates  on  which  a  CTC  permit  issued  were  effected  under  a 
provisional  permit  and,  citing  Education  Code  section  8364,  argues  each 
respondent’s  service  “shall  not  be  included  in  computing  the  service  required 
as  a  prerequisite  to  attainment  of,  or  eligibility  to,  classification  as  a  permanent 
employee  of  a  child  development  program.”  In  other  words,  although  hired, 
these  District  employees  may  not  receive  the  benefit  of  Education  Code 
section  44845  because  of  a  purported  limitation  imposed  by  section  8364.

Education  Code  section  8360,  subdivision  (a)(1)  provides,  in  pertinent 
part:  “Child  development  programs  shall  include  a  career  ladder 
program  for  classroom  staff.  Persons  who  are  18  years  of  age  and  older 
may  be  employed  as  aides  and  may  be  eligible  for  salary  increases 
upon  the  completion  of  additional  semester  units  in  early  childhood 
education  or  child  development.” 

The  District  originally  employed  each  of  the  respondents,  either  as  a 
substitute  teacher  (Ms.  Southivilay)  or  as  temporary  teachers  (Ms. 
Thao,  Ms.  Lee,  Ms.  Redd,  and  Ms,  Torrez).  Their  presence  in  the 
classroom,  and  capacity  to  render  services  to  District  pupils,  was  based 
on  a  “provisional  permit”””  or  a  “temporary  certificate.”*?  The  District, 
mindful  that  each  respondent  lacked  a  CTC  permit  at  the  time  of  her 
original  employment,  considered  their  employment  as  “temporary.”

|  Respondent  Yia  Thao,  originally  employed  by  the  District  on 

September  10,  1997,  did  not  obtain  a  CTC  permit  until 
December  11,  2000.

Respondent  Vanmany  Southivilay,  originally  employed  by  the 
District  on  September  27,  1999,  as  an  intermittent  substitute,  did 
not  obtain  a  CTC  permit  until  July  24,  2000. 

Respondent  Cynthia  Torrez,  originally  employed  by  the  District 
on  July  24,  2000,  did  not  obtain  a  CTC  permit  until  January  30, 
2002. 

(d) 

|  Respondents  Houa  Lee  and  Jaquetta  Redd,  originally  employed 

by  the  District  on  July  24,  2000,  did  not  obtain  their  CTC 
permits  until  December  15,  2000. 

Respondents’  lack  of  a  CTC  permit  does  not  provide  a  sufficient  basis 
pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  8360,  8364,  8365,  and  8365  to 
compel  deference  to  their  argument  that  their  original  dates  of  hire 
should  supplant  the  District  assigned  seniority  dates. 

Respondents  next  seek  to  characterize  their  provisional  or  temporary 
status  as  “probationary”  pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44845. 
Education  Code  section  44845  specifically  sets  forth:  “Every 
probationary  or  permanent  employee  employed  after  June  30,  1947, 
shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  employed  on  the  date  upon  which  he  first 
rendered  paid  service  in  a  probationary  position.”  Respondents  have 
failed  to  demonstrate  that  this  provision  is  applicable  to  ECE  teachers 
on  a  provisional,  temporary,  or  permit  status.”>  Mindful  that  there  are 
only  four  possible  teacher  classifications:  “permanent,  probationary, 
substitute  and  temporary””°  and  that  “the  Education  Code  does  not  refer 
to  or  classify  teachers  as  ‘provisional,’”  it  appears  evident  that  each 
respondent,  while  serving  under  her  “provisional  permit”  or  “temporary 
certificate,”  was  entitled  to  classification  as  a  probationary  or  even 
temporary  employee,  but  not  for  purposes  of  attaining  tenure.”’

Allowing  employees  teaching  under  a  temporary  credential  or 
provisional  permit  to  accrue  seniority  could  lead  to  the  absurd  result  of 
such  employees  being  retained  in  a  layoff  situation  over  fully- 
credentialed  teachers  with  less  school  District  service.”
