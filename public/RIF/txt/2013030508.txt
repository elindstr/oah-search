The decision was not related to the competency or dedication of the individuals whose
services are proposed to be reduced or eliminated.

The Sweetwater Union High School District staff carried out the Board of

of paid probationary service. The selection process was in accordance with the requirements
of the Education Code.

4.

On March 14, 2013, the District’s Assistant Superintendent of Human

Resources served permanent and probationary certificated Respondents with “Notice of
Recommendation That Services Will Not Be Required” (Notice). The Notice included a
copy of Resolution No. 4198, a copy of the Accusation, informed each Respondent that
he/she had a right to request a hearing and a blank Request for Hearing/Notice of Defense
form, accompanied by relevant sections of the Evidence Code and Government Code. In
addition, the Notice informed each Respondent that if he/she wished to request a hearing that
the Request for Hearing/Notice of Defense must be filed no later than March 28, 2013, at the
District’s office to the Director of Human Resources (Director).

Each Respondent submitted a timely Request for Hearing/Notice of Defense to

determine if there was cause for not re-employing him or her for the ensuing school year.

5.

On April 5, 2013, the District served Respondents with a Notice of Hearing

setting the hearing for April 18, 2013, in accordance with Government Code section 11509.

4

6.

On April 12, 2013, counsel for the District and counsel for 32 of 38

Respondents filed a Joint Request for Continuance of Hearing (Joint Request) in this matter.
The Joint Request was served on the other six Respondents, none of whom opposed the
request.

7.

On April 16, 2013, Administrative Law Judge Mary Agnes Matyszewski

issued an Order granting the continuance and setting a new hearing date of May 17, 2013.
Pursuant to Education Code section 44949, subdivision (e), the Order granting the
continuance of the hearing extends the statutory deadline for providing a final notice of
layoff by 28 days.2 Specifically, the District must serve Respondents with a final notice of
layoff before June 15, 2013.

8.

In accordance with Government Code section 11509, on April 16, 2013, the

District served Respondents with an Amended Notice of Hearing, setting the hearing for May
17, 2013.

9.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements were satisfied.

10.

There was no appearance by or on behalf of Respondent Yvette Nelson.

11.

The District considered all known attrition, including resignations and

retirements, in determining the actual number of final layoff notices to be delivered to its
certificated employees. As a result of attrition and after a “more refined analysis,” the
District proposed to reduce or eliminate 49.1572 FTE positions.

During the hearing, the District rescinded layoff notices previously issued to Ana

Abrego, Nicholas Anderson, Amy Miranda and Tabitha Ross. Thus, the District proposes to
reduce or eliminate 44.1572 FTE positions.

12.

The District’s Director was responsible for implementing the technical aspects

of the layoff. She developed a seniority list for probationary or permanent certificated staff
that included, among other matters, the name of the certificated employee, assignment,
seniority date, credentials and status.

The Director used the seniority list to develop a proposed order of layoff list to
determine the least senior employees currently assigned to provide the service being reduced.
Then, the District determined whether the least senior employees held credentials in another
area that would entitle them to “bump” other junior employees. In determining who would
be laid off for the service reduced, the Director counted the number of reductions and
determined the impact on incumbent staff in inverse order of seniority. Then, she checked
the credentials of each affected individual and whether he/she could “bump” another
employee. The counselors whose positions were identified for layoff displaced or bumped
more junior counselors.

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (c)

13.

The services that the Board proposed to reduce were “particular kinds of

services” that can be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section
44955. The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue these particular kinds of services was
not arbitrary or capricious but constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

14.

The Board’s reduction or discontinuance of particular kinds of services related

to the welfare of the District and its pupils. The reduction or discontinuance of particular
kinds of services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the
District as determined by the Board.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

5.

6.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 and

44955. All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in these sections are satisfied.

A District may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not,
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford vs. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.)

3.

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the

Sweetwater Union High School District to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services.
The cause for the reduction or discontinuance of particular kinds of services is related solely
to the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof.

4.

A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a
continuing position that he/she is certificated and competent to fill. In doing so, the senior
employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that position. (Poppers
v. Tamalpais Union High School Dist. (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 399, 405.)

No employee with less seniority than any Respondent is being retained to

perform a service that any Respondent is certificated and competent to render.

All arguments not addressed herein are not supported by the evidence and/or

the law and therefore rejected.

1.

The layoff notices issued to Respondents Ana Abrego, Nicholas Anderson,
Amy Miranda and Tabitha Ross are rescinded. The Accusations against Respondents Ana
Abrego, Nicholas Anderson, Amy Miranda and Tabitha Ross are dismissed.

ORDER

6

2.

Except as provided in paragraph one of this Order, the Accusations served on

Respondents listed on Exhibit “A” are sustained. The Sweetwater Union High School
District shall give notice to these Respondents before June 15, 2013, that their services will
not be required for the 2013-2014 school year because of the reduction or discontinuance of
particular kinds of services.

3.

Notice shall be given in inverse order of seniority.
