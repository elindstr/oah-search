PROPOSED DECISION

Samuel D. Reyes, Administrative Law Judge, Office of Administrative Hearings, heard

this matter on April 26, 2012, in Bakersfield, California.

Christopher W. Hine, Attorney at Law, represented Chris Crawford (Crawford),

Superintendent of the Greenfield Union School District (District).

Respondents requested a hearing for a determination of whether cause exists for not
reemploying them for the 2012-2013 school year.

Oral and documentary evidence, and evidence by oral stipulation on the record, was

received at the hearing, and the matter was submitted for decision.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

2.

Superintendent Crawford filed the Accusation in his official capacity.

On March 7, 2012, the Governing Board of the District (Governing Board)

2012-2013 school year:

4.0

3.0

29.0

4.

Superintendent Crawford thereafter provided written notice to the Governing
Board and to Respondents that he recommended the termination of Respondents’ services for
the 2012-2013 school year due to the reduction of particular kinds of services.

5.

On March 9, 2012, and on March 12, 2012 with respect to Respondents Lara and
Roquemore, the District provided notice to Respondents that their services will not be required
for the 2012-2013 school year due to the reduction of particular kinds of services. Respondents
filed timely requests for hearing.

6.

On March 26, 2012, the District filed and thereafter served the Accusation and
other required documents on Respondents. Respondents filed timely Notices of Defense,
seeking a determination of whether cause exists for not reemploying them for the 2012-2013
school year.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.

7.

8.

The services set forth in factual finding number 3 are particular kinds of services

which may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.2

1 Full-time equivalent position.

2 All further statutory references are to the Education Code.

2

9.

The decision to reduce or discontinue the particular kinds of services set forth in
factual finding number 3 is neither arbitrary nor capricious but is rather a proper exercise of the
District's discretion.

10.

The reduction or discontinuation of the services set forth in factual finding
number 3, in the context of potential revenue declines and the need to continue providing
services to students if such losses materialize, is related to the welfare of the District and its
pupils, and it has become necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees as
determined by the Governing Board.

11.

Respondent Holloway has a seniority date of August 14, 2006, and holds a
multiple subject credential with a supplemental authorization in English. She teaches Sixth
Grade.

12.

Respondent Roquemore has a seniority date of August 13, 2007, and she holds a
multiple subject credential with supplemental authorizations in Math and English. She teaches
Seventh Grade Math.

13.

Respondents Holloway and Roquemore are credentialed and competent to teach
language arts classes that two other certificated employees, Lynn San Miguel (San Miguel) and
Connie Leija (Leija), were retained to teach. San Miguel has a seniority date of August 14,
2006, and Leija has a seniority date of August 6, 2008. Respondents Holloway and Roquemore
argue that they should be able to displace, or bump, the retained employees. Because San
Miguel is senior to Respondent Roquemore, there is only one position to which one of the two
respondents could bump into,
that of Leija. Since Respondent Holloway is senior to
Respondent Roquemore, she would be the one able to displace, or bump, Leija.

14.

The District did not retain Respondents Holloway or Roquemore because it
concluded that they were not “highly qualified” within the meaning of the “No Child Left
Behind” federal law. The District is concerned that retaining teachers who do not meet the
requirement of the law would lead to loss of federal funding. However, the District did not
show that Respondents Holloway and Roquemore would not be “highly qualified” for any of
the District’s existing positions. Nor did the District show that a penalty or actual loss of funds
would result from the retention of either respondent if such retention were required by State
law. In any event, the Governing Board did not adopt any competency criteria that included
compliance with No Child Left Behind as a factor in the layoff, and did not otherwise inform
Respondents that they may be subject to termination or layoff if deemed not highly qualified
with reference to No Child Left Behind.

15. With the exception of Respondent Holloway, the District did not retain any
certificated employee junior to any Respondent to render a service which any Respondent is
certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Jurisdiction for the subject proceeding exists pursuant to sections 44949 and

44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 7.

2.

The services listed in factual finding number 3 are particular kinds of services
that may be reduced or discontinued pursuant to section 44955, by reason of factual finding
numbers 3 and 8.

3.

Cause exists under sections 44949 and 44955 for the reduction of the particular
kinds of services set forth in factual finding number 3, which cause relates solely to the welfare
of the District's schools and pupils, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 10.

4.

Section 44955, subdivision (b), provides, in pertinent part: “[t]he services of no
permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions of this section while any
probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to render a service
which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.” (Emphasis added.)
“Certificated” is defined by the provisions of the Education Code pertaining to credentials, but
“competent” is not specifically defined. In Forker v. Board of Trustees (1994) 160 Cal.App.3d
13, 19, the Court defined the term in a reemployment proceeding under section 44956, in terms
of the teachers’ skills and qualifications, specifically, as “relating to special qualifications for a
vacant position, rather than relating to the on-the-job performance of the laid-off permanent
employee.” In doing so, the Court noted that courts in reduction in force cases, namely Brough
v. Governing Board (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 702, 714-15, and Moreland Teachers Association
v. Kurze (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 648, 654-55, had interpreted the term in a similar manner.

Courts in analogous layoff and reemployment contexts, construing provisions similar to
section 44955, have recognized that school districts have discretion to establish rules to define
teacher competency. Thus, after reviewing earlier cases, the Court in Duax v. Kern Community
College District (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 555, 565, wrote: “Hence, from these authorities we
conclude that a board’s definition of competency is reasonable when it considers the skills and
qualifications of the teacher threatened with layoff.” (See also Martin v. Kentfield School
District (1983) 35 Cal.3d 294, 299-300; Forker v. Board of Trustees, supra.) In this case, the
Governing Board did not establish any criteria defining teacher competency.

Respondents Holloway and Roquemore established that

they are certificated and
competent to render language arts services which two other teachers were retained to render.
However, because of the seniority of one of the individuals involved, San Miguel, only one
position is available into which the respondents could bump, that of Lejia. As the most senior of
the respondents, Respondent Holloway may bump into that position. Therefore, cause does not
exist to terminate the services of Respondent Holloway for the 2012-2013 school year.

5.

Cause exists to terminate the services of Respondents Chudy, Dotson, Girguis,
Huff, Lara, Mashburn, Ozuna, and Roquemore for the 2012-2013 school year due to the
reduction of particular kinds of services, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 15, and
legal conclusion numbers 1 through 4.

ORDER

1.

The Accusation is sustained in part and the District may notify Respondents
Chudy, Dotson, Girguis, Huff, Lara, Mashburn, Ozuna, and Roquemore that their services will
not be needed during the 2012-2013 school year due to the reduction of particular kinds of
services.

2.

The Accusation is dismissed with respect to Respondent Holloway, who shall be

retained for the 2012-2013 school year.
