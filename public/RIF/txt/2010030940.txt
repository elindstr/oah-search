FACTUAL FINDINGS  

 
          1. 
Harold Vollkommer made and filed the accusation in his official capacity as 
Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources, San Bernardino City Unified School District. 
 

2. 

Respondents are identified in Appendix A, attached hereto and incorporated

4. 

On March 2, 2010, the Board of Education of the San Bernardino City Unified 

by this reference.  All respondents are certificated employees of the district. 
 
 
School District (Board) adopted a resolution entitled Reduction of Particular Kinds of 
Certificated Services-A, which reduced particular kinds of services and directed the 
superintendent to give appropriate notices to certificated employees whose positions would 
be affected by the action.  The resolution involved the reduction or elimination of 196 full 
time equivalent (FTE) positions.  
 
 
In the resolution the Board “determined that due to a significant population of 
English language learners with specialized educational needs, a specific and compelling need 
exists to employ and retain certificated employees who have formal (not emergency) 
authorization to teach English Learner (“EL”) students, as determined by the California 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing, and the special training and experience that comes” 
from having such an authorization. 
 
 
containing one or more EL students with a certificated employee possessing an appropriate 
EL authorization is ‘misassignment’ subject to sanction by the County Superintendent of 
Schools.” The resolution referenced laws pertaining to EL students and noted that the 
district’s needs and its students’ needs “should not and cannot be adequately served by 
concentrating EL students in particular classrooms in such a manner as to lessen the need for 
certificated employees with EL authorizations.”  
 

The resolution specifically noted that the “failure to staff a classroom

Respondents’ closing brief was marked and received in evidence as Exhibit 38.  The district’s 
reply brief was marked and received in evidence as Exhibit 39.  The points raised in those briefs were addressed 
throughout this decision.

The Board also established a bump analysis to determine which employees 

The resolution authorized the superintendent to deviate from the seniority list, 

 
could bump into a position being held by a junior employee.  The resolution defined 
“competency” pursuant to Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), for the purposes 
of bumping as possession of “(1) a valid credential in the relevant subject matter area; (2) 
‘highly qualified’ status under the No Child Left Behind Act in the position to be assumed; 
and (3) an appropriate formal (not emergency) EL authorization, if required by the position 
to be assumed.”   
 
 
i.e. to “skip” more junior employees, if necessary, pursuant to Education Code section 
44955(d)(1).  The superintendent was directed to implement the resolution in a manner that 
was consistent with the district’s policies and its efforts to offer certain services to its 
students.  There is no legal requirement mandating that skipping criteria be contained in a 
resolution.  Employees who met any of the skipping criteria for some but not all of their 
assignment(s) were to be retained only for that portion of their assignment that required the 
skipping criteria. 
 
In January 2009 the California Department of Education informed the district 
 
that it had failed to meet “Adequate Yearly Progress” and that it had failed to meet the “100 
percent Highly Qualified Teacher requirement for three consecutive years as mandated by 
NCLB.”  As a result of these failures, the district was placed into Level C of the Compliance, 
Monitoring, Interventions, and Sanctions Program for the 2008-2009 school year.  The 
district skipped employees who were highly qualified under NCLB standards and employees 
who were authorized to teach EL students.  The district skipped these teachers because 
approximately 17,000, or one third, of the district’s students are EL students.  The district 
introduced the teacher qualifications it had adopted in 2007 to improve EL student 
achievement as required by NCLB.  
  
 
Resolving Ties in Seniority Related to Certificated Layoffs” which established tie-breaking 
criteria to determine the order of termination for those employees who shared the same 
seniority dates.   
 
 
established on the date of the hearing.  
 
11.  On or before March 12, 2010,2 written notice was given to certificated 
 
employees, including respondents, of the recommendation that their services would not be 
required for the 2010-11 school year.  The reasons for the recommendation were set forth in 
these preliminary layoff notices.  Thereafter, an accusation was served on each respondent 
who requested a hearing.  Except for the notice issue specifically addressed in Findings of 
Fact No. 30 below, all prehearing jurisdictional requirements were met.  

The master schedules for the schools for the 2010-2011 school year were not

12. 

Before issuing the preliminary layoff notices, the district took into account all 

positively assured attrition.  The district must issue final layoff notices before May 15, and 
when it does so the district will take into account any additional attrition that has occurred.  
After that, further attrition will allow the district to rehire employees whose employment was 
terminated as a result of this reduction in force proceeding.  An issue arose during the 
hearing regarding the vacancies created by attrition which has occurred since March 15, but 
the district was not required to consider those vacancies.  (San Jose Teachers Association v. 
Allen (1983) 144 Cal. App. 3d 627.) 

The layoffs will not reduce any of the district’s educational offerings to levels 

below those levels required by law.   

  

The district alleged that that it relied on its seniority list when making layoff 

15.  At issue in this proceeding was the district’s use of an EL certificate to justify 

 
decisions and that the district sent verification requests to employees before March 15 to 
verify the accuracy of the information on that seniority.  The district received updated 
information until the day before the hearing, which allowed the district to rescind several 
notices. 
 
The District’s Skipping Criteria and Bumping Analysis  
 
 
its retention of more junior employees over others with more seniority that did not possess an 
EL certificate.  The evidence established the district’s need for employees with EL 
certificates, especially in light of the State’s non-compliance report issued to the district.  The 
evidence established that the district had adopted a policy in 2007 in which the district 
advised teachers of the need for EL training and of its value to the district.  The evidence 
established that the district sent letters in late summer 2009 to all employees who were not 
EL certified, advising them to obtain EL certification because such certification was most 
likely going to be used as a skipping criteria.  The district allowed teachers to submit proof of 
having obtained EL certification right up until the day before the hearing, even going so far 
as accepting proof of EL certifications issued by the local university the Saturday before the 
hearing so that those employees who completed the EL certification training on that day 
would not have to drive to the district’s offices to submit proof.  The district went “above and 
beyond” the call of duty to advise employees of the importance of the EL certification and it 
provided them with ample opportunity to obtain the certification.  The evidence did not 
establish that the district’s EL certification criteria were arbitrary or capricious. (San Jose 
Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal. App. 3d 627, 637.) 
 
 
that requires the district to retain senior employees over more junior employees and to retain 
permanent employees over temporary employees.  Any exception to this general rule must be 
based on statute.  For employees hired on the same date, Education Code section 44955, 
subdivision (d) provides: 

16.   Education Code section 44955, subdivisions (b) and (c), sets forth a general rule 

 4
      
-- 

 
 
 

 

 

“(d)  Notwithstanding subdivision (b), a school district may deviate from terminating a 
certificated employee in order of seniority for either of the following reasons: 
 

(1) 

The district demonstrates a specific need for personnel to teach a specific 
course or course of study, or to provide services authorized by a services credential with 
a specialization in either pupil personnel services or health for a school nurse, and that 
the certificated employee has special training and experience necessary to teach that 
course or course of study or to provide those services, which others with more seniority 
do not possess. 
 

(2) 

For purposes of maintaining or achieving compliance with constitutional 

requirements related to equal protection of the laws.” 

17.  Under subdivision (d)(1), a district may skip a junior teacher being retained for 

specified reasons.  (Bledsoe v. Biggs Unified School District (2008) 170 Cal. App. 4 th127, 
131.)  Junior teachers may be given retention priority over senior teachers only if the junior 
teachers possess superior skills or capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack.  
(Santa Clara Federation of Teachers, Local 2393, v. Governing Board of Santa Clara 
Unified School District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831, 842-843.)   

 
18.  A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a 

continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to fill.  In doing so, the 
senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that position.  
(Lacy v. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469, 473-474.)   

 
 
19.  Although the district’s use of EL certification as a skipping criteria was not 
arbitrary or capricious, the way in which the district implemented its use in this proceeding was 
arbitrary and capricious.  A preponderance of the evidence established that when the district 
compiled its layoff list, the district did not permit employees to move between the various types 
of schools.  Even if a middle schoolteacher were certificated and competent to bump a junior 
high school teacher, the district did not permit that to occur.  Assistant Superintendent 
Vollkommer testified that the district did not “move between schools.”  The district’s actions 
were contrary to the Education Code.  Other than the employment of ROP and adult education 
teachers, which was not at issue here, there is nothing in the Education Codes that restricts 
skipping and bumping to the type of school where an employee teaches.  For example, if a 
middle school teacher is certificated and competent, he or she can bump a more junior high 
school teacher.   
 

20. 

Layoff notices should be rescinded in those cases in which a notice was served 

upon more senior respondent who was certificated and competent to hold a position being 
retained by a more junior employee on the basis that the more junior teacher taught at a

different type of school3, and the accusations improperly served upon those respondents 
should be dismissed. 
 
 
Romero testified that they hold the requisite competence, certification and seniority to bump 
a more junior teacher who is currently teaching at a different school.  It is recommended that 
district review its personnel files to determine if these individuals are entitled by their 
seniority and credentials to bump a more junior employee. 
 
 
Magdaleno, Lori Maxwell, Linda Gordon, Ty Stockham, Adrian Eddington, Randall Jensen, 
Randall Murray, John Arient, Paula Bougie, John Rezendes-Herrick, David Daniels and Eric 
Abrams completed their CLAD certification at the University of Redlands class the Saturday 
before the hearing, but none of them had their notices rescinded; the district offered no 
explanation for this omission.  Since the district withdrew the notices and accusations filed 
against all other teachers who completed that Saturday class, fairness dictates that the notices 
and accusations filed against these respondents be rescinded, as well, especially if these 
respondents have more seniority than other teachers who are being retained.  
 
 
Respondent Shawndee Hatfield testified that the district’s bumping list was 
incorrect because she is NCLB compliant.  Based upon this testimony and the evidence in 
support thereof, the district revised its bumping list and withdrew the accusation and rescinded 
the notice that was issued to Hatfield.  This amendment in the seniority list resulted in 
respondent MarLan Parker moving from the precautionary layoff list to the final layoff list 
proposed by the district.  
 
 
Respondents Eric Abrams and Paula Bougie testified that they have the requisite 
EL certification and they could not understand why their colleagues with less seniority had their 
notices rescinded while theirs remained in place.  The district explained in its closing argument 
that Abrams and Bougie were on the precautionary layoff list only, but the district offered no 
explanation for the reason their colleagues’ notices were rescinded and Abrams’ and Bougie’s 
were not.  It is recommended the district review Abrams’ and Bougie’s personnel files, correct 
them to reflect their current certifications, and then determine if these individuals have 
sufficient seniority to retain their employment. 
 
 
in December 2009 and that employees with less seniority were being retained.  It is 
recommended that the district review Younglove’s personnel file, correct it to reflect her current 
certification, and then determine if she has sufficient seniority to retain her employment, 
especially in light of the fact that the district rescinded the layoff notices of individuals who had 
EL certification.

teacher; a certificated and competent middle school teacher can bump an elementary school or high school teacher; 
and a certificated and competent high school teacher can bump an elementary school or middle school teacher. 

Respondent Gina Younglove testified that she received her CLAD certification

Several employees testified about the reasons they had not yet obtained their EL 

 
 
Respondent JoAnne Hammer introduced documentation to support her testimony 
that she has a CLAD certification and not an SDAIE certificate, as was recorded in the district’s 
seniority list.  It is recommended the district review her personnel file, correct it to reflect her 
current certification, and determine if she has sufficient security to retain her employment. 
 
 
certification.  Marie de Bello explained that her degree did not require her to take a foreign 
language, which is a prerequisite to obtaining her EL certification.  Dita Lehrack, explained that 
she was scheduled to take the EL courses in the summer of 2009, but her husband was 
diagnosed with terminal cancer and she cared for him instead. Lehrack is currently scheduled to 
complete her EL certification coursework in May.  Jennifer Noel testified that over the years 
when she tried to take the EL courses offered by the district, she was told that she did not 
qualify for them for one reason or another.  However, nothing prevented Noel from obtaining 
the certification from a non-district-sponsored source.  The explanations offered by these three 
respondents were insufficient in light of the district’s needs. 
 
Substitute Teacher Issues 
 
 
arguing that he should be given credit for previous substitute teaching experience within the 
district. Education Code section 44918, subdivision (a), provides that any employee classified 
as a substitute or temporary employee who serves during one school year for at least 75 percent 
of the number of days of the school year shall be deemed to have served one year as a 
probationary employee if he or she is employed as a probationary employee the following year. 
 Romero testified that in the past he has worked more than 75 percent of the school year, but not 
in the school year immediately before his employment as a middle school teacher.  Romero is 
being paid at a “Level III” salary level because of his prior experience in the district.  Although 
the district chose to pay Romero at a higher rate because of this experience, nothing in the 
Education Code allows him to have his seniority date amended since he did not work 75 percent 
of the school days during the school year before he was employed on a full-time basis.   
 
 
because they had worked more than 75 percent in the previous school year as substitute 
teachers.  It is recommended that in light of Education Code section 44918, subdivision (a), the 
district review their personnel files and determine if their seniority dates should be adjusted 
based upon their prior substitute teacher experience, as well as determine if they have sufficient 
seniority based upon their prior substitute teaching to retain their employment. 
 
Service Issue

re-employed he provided the district with his new residence address and received his paychecks

Respondent Craig Lampert was previously employed by the district and he

at that address.  A copy of his pay stub corroborated his testimony.  However, for whatever 
reason and no valid reason was offered at hearing, Lampert’s notice was served at his previous 
address.  Lampert was unaware of the notice until a colleague advised him that his name was on 
the layoff list.  The district argued that since he appeared at this hearing, notice was sufficient.  
However, without proper service on Lampert, he cannot be a party to these proceedings and 
this administrative law court lacks jurisdiction to proceed on the district’s case filed against 
him.   
 
Credential Issues 
 

31. 

Respondent Pamela Bruce disputed the district’s seniority list which indicated 

that she had a Preliminary Single Subject Science credential.  Bruce submitted transcripts 
which indicated she had “cleared” that credential by taking courses in March 2009 and April 
2010.  It is recommended the district review Bruce’s personnel file and update it accordingly. 
 However, the district is entitled to consider those credentials currently held when it issues its 
preliminary layoff notices and Bruce’s credential was not “cleared” until after the March 15 
notice deadline.  Accordingly, she was properly served with a notice and accusation.  

Respondent Angela Shih pointed out that she has a clear credential, which was 

reflected on the seniority list, but the district’s Bump Analysis listed her as having only a 
preliminary credential.  The district admitted that the Bump Analysis was incorrect, but that 
this error did not affect her status.  It is recommended the district review Shih’s personnel 
file and the bump analysis to ensure that her notice was proper. 

Respondent Michelle de Puzo testified that the seniority list incorrectly 

identified her as having an intern credential when she possesses a preliminary credential.  de 
Puzo received her CLAD on March 19, 2010, which makes her highly qualified under 
NCLB.  de Puzo also disputed her August 21, 2009, start date, testifying that her correct start 
date should be August 11, 2009, the date her principal required her to attend mandatory 
training for which she was paid.  She introduced e-mails and documents corroborating her 
claim.  The preponderance of the evidence established that de Puzo was required to attend 
the mandatory training and that she reasonably relied on the statements made by her principal 
and attended the training under the reasonable belief that her attendance was required.  She 
forwent her summer vacation in order to attend this orientation.  In its closing argument, the 
district stated that it had identified a vacancy that de Puzo was entitled to occupy and the 
district withdrew its accusation and rescinded the notice filed against de Puzo.

34. 

Respondent Cynthia Castillo testified that her credential was incorrectly listed 

on the seniority list.  She obtained her preliminary credential in December 2009, but she is 
still listed as only having an intern credential.  It is recommended the district review 
Castillo’s personnel file, make the necessary correction, and then determine if she has 
sufficient seniority to permit her to retain her employment.

Respondent Laura Wheeler testified that other English teachers with lower 

Respondent Bonnie Warren inquired if she was eligible for a different seniority 

Other Issues 
 
 
seniority dates received precautionary layoff notices whereas she had received a layoff notice 
despite her seniority.  Wheeler teaches the REACH program which makes her “highly 
qualified.”  It is recommended the district review Wheeler’s personnel file and determine if 
she has sufficient seniority and competency to permit her to retain her employment, 
especially in light of Findings of Fact Nos. 15-20, inclusive. 
  
 
date because of her prior work experience in the district.  Warren worked between 2002 and 
2006 as an intern, teaching in the same class during the 2005-2006 school year.  Warren left her 
employment when she could not pass her CSET examination.  After passing the CSET 
examination in the summer of 2006, Warren was re-employed by the district during the 2006-
2007 school year as an Opportunity Teacher at the high school with an intern credential.  She 
separated from employment on September 2, 2008, when her intern credential lapsed.  She 
obtained her clear credential on December 8, 2008, and she was re-employed by the district as a 
high school teacher.  Education Code section 44464 expressly provides that interns do not 
have the rights provided by Education Code sections 44948 and 44949.  Nothing in the 
Education Code permits the district to “tack on” additional time for those years during which 
Warren worked as an intern.  Her seniority date was correctly determined by the district.  
 
 
understand why she was on the regular layoff list when employee # 2555, who holds a 
CLAD, was on the precautionary layoff list.  The district offered no explanation for this.  In 
light of the findings in Findings of Fact Nos. 15-20, it is recommended the district review 
Mjoic-Mastranzo’s personnel file and determines if she has sufficient seniority to retain her 
employment. 
 
 
as to why employee numbers 2539 and 2528, who have less seniority, were being retained 
when she was being laid off.  It is recommended that the district review Lopez-Alonso’s 
personnel file, make any necessary corrections to reflect her correct credential, and then 
determine if she has sufficient seniority to retain her employment. 
 
Precautionary Layoff Issues 
 
 
The district issued precautionary layoff notices to ensure that it could reduce 
its force in sufficient numbers as ordered by the Board.  There was nothing improper in the 
district taking this precaution.  Given the recommendations noted above and below, at this 
juncture none of the precautionary layoff notices can be rescinded until such time as the 
district complies with those recommendations.  Some of the recommendations may result in 
employees who initially received a precautionary layoff notice being placed on the district’s 

Respondent Monica Lopez-Alonso, whose credential cleared in 2009, inquired

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

 

1. 

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to sections 44949 and 44955, 

3. 

2. 

A district may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955, 

The decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is matter 

and all notices and other requirements of those sections have been provided as required. 
 
 
subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not, 
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that 
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to 
deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 
178-179.)   
 
 
reserved to the district’s discretion and is not subject to second-guessing in this proceeding.  
(Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 
167.) 
 
Because of the reduction of particular kinds of services, cause exists pursuant 
 
to Education Code section 44955 to give notice to respondents that their services will not be 
required for the 2010-2011 school year.  The cause relates solely to the welfare of the 
schools and the pupils thereof within the meaning of Education Code section 44949.  The 
district has identified the certificated employees who are providing the particular kinds of 
services that the Governing Board directed be reduced or discontinued.  It is recommended 
that the Governing Board give respondents notice before May 15, 2010, that their services 
will not be required by the District for the school year 2010-11.
