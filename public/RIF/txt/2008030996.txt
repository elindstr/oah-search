FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

On  March  13,  2008,  the  governing  board  of  the  Scotia  Union  School  District 

adopted  Resolution  No.  2008-005,  in  which  the  board  resolved  to  reduce  or  discontinue 
particular  kinds  of  services  at  the  end of the  2007-2008  school  year.  The  following  particular 
kinds  of  services  are  to  be  eliminated: 

2.00 
1.00 
0.80 

K-4th  Grade  Classroom  Teaching  Positions. 
5th-8th  Grade  Departmentalized  Teaching  Position. 
Music  Teaching  Position. 

The  resolution  directed  the  district’s  superintendent,  or  her  designee,  to  initiate 
procedures  to  not  reemploy  the  equivalent  of  3.8  full-time  equivalent  certificated  employees 
of  the  district  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955. 

2. 

On  March  14,  2008,  District  Superintendent  Jaenelle  L.  Lampp  sent  notice  to 
five  certificated  employees  of  her  recommendation  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or 
discontinued  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  Two  of  those  employees  requested  a  hearing  to 
determine  if  there  was  cause  to  not  re-employ  them.  Prior  to  hearing,  the  district  withdrew

the  accusation  against  Amy  Gossien.  Dana  Christen  is  the  remaining  respondent  in  this 
proceeding. 

The  parties  stipulated  that  the  district  has  complied  with  all  procedural 

requirements  of  Education  Code  section  449949  and  44955. 

The  decision  to  reduce  3.8  full-time  equivalent  teaching  positions  was  based 

on  a  combination  of  declining  enrollment  and  an  anticipated  loss  of  revenue  from  the  State  of 
California  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

5. 

Respondent  has  been  employed  with  the  district  since  September  8,  1981,  as  a 
0.8  FTE  music  teacher.  In  addition  to  holding  a  single  subject  music  credential  and  having  a 
master’s  degree  in  music,  respondent  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential  which  authorizes  her 
to  teach  in  self-contained  classrooms  up  to  grade  nine.  This  credential  would  therefore 
authorize  respondent  to  teach  in  the  district’s  self-contained  classrooms. 

Respondent  is  one  of  the  more  senior  teachers  in  the  district.  Respondent  argues  that 

she  should  be  able  to  bump  into  a  self-contained  classroom  teaching  position  held  by 
teachers  junior  to  her.  Each  teacher  junior 
respondent  is  requesting  to  partially  bump  a  more  junior  teacher  for  four-fifths  of  that 
teacher’s  full-time  position. 

to  respondent  holds  a  1.0  FTE  position.  Thus 

The  district  argues  that  part-time  employees  are  not  entitled  to  bump  into  full-time 
positions,  citing  a  number  of  cases  that  analyze  rehire  rights  under  Education  Code  section 
44956,  (See  e.g.,  Murray  v.  Sonoma  County of Office  of  Education  (1989)  208  Cal.App.3d 
456,  460;  Waldron  v.  Sulphur  Springs  Union  School  District  (1979)  96  Cal.App.  3d  506; 
King  v.  Berkeley  Unified  School  District  (1979)  89  Cal.App.3d  1016,  1020-1021.)  As  a  part- 
time  teacher,  respondent  is  not  entitled  to  an  assignment  greater  than  0.8  FTE.  Thus,  if 
respondent  were  permitted  to  bump  a  junior  teacher,  she  would  only  be  retained  for  0.8  FTE 
of  the  classroom  teaching  position,  and  the  junior  teacher  would  be  retained  for  the 
remaining  0.2  FTE  position.  This  would  translate  to  respondent  teaching  four  days  a  week, 
and  the  junior  teacher  teaching  one  day  a  week,  or  some  other  tedious  arrangement.  While 
this  split  teaching  arrangement  might  be  practical  in  some  programs  and  in  some  districts,  it 
would  not  be  practical  or  efficient  in  a  small  elementary  program  like  Scotia’s  where  all 
classroom  teachers  work  full-time.  It  is  therefore  determined  that  the  district  should  not  be 
forced  to  split  an  elementary  teaching  position  to  accommodate a  senior  part-time  employee. 
Respondent  is  not  entitled  to  bump  a  more  junior  teacher  from  four-fifths  of  her  position. 

6. 

No  certificated  employee  junior 

in  seniority  to  respondent  is  being  retained  by 

the  district  to  perform  services  that  respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

7. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  is  related  to  the 

welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof. 

 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  for  this  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections 

44949  and  44955,  and  all  notices  and  other  requirements  of  those  sections  have  been 
provided  as  required  by  law. 

2. 

Cause  exists  because  of  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services  pursuant 
to  Education  Code  section  44955  to  give  notice  to  respondents  that  their  services  will  not  be 
required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  cause  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the 
schools  and  its  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949, 

ORDER 

Notice  may  be  given  to  respondent  Dana  Christen  that  her  services  will  not  be 
required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of 
services.
