FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1, 

The  parties,  by  and  through  their  counsel,  stipulated  as  follows: 

The  correct  seniority  date  for  Margaret  K.  Burns  is  March  12,  2003. 

The  district  failed  to  serve  Margaret  K.  Burns  with  a  notice  that  it  was 
recommended  that  she  be  notified  that  the  district  would  not  require  her 
services  for  the  ensuing  school  year.  The  district  will  not  lay  off  Ms. 
Burns.

The  district  rescinds  the  notice  served  on  Eunice  Nuval. 

Amber  Cross  is  a  “Probationary  II’  employee  with  a  date  of  hire  of 
August  21,  2002. 

On  the  district’s  bumping  chart,  Amber  Cross  is  replaced  with  Kristena 
Bass,  a  “Probationary  I’  employee  with  a  date  of  hire  of  September  4, 
2003. 

On  the  district’s  bumping  chart,  Phyllis  Ciment  is  replaced  with  Henry 
Mach. 

The  correct  seniority  date  for  Gabriel  Alegre  is  December  21,  2003. 

Lisa  Vasquez-McGee  is  a  “Probationary  II”  employee  with  a  date  of 
hire  of  August  16,  2002. 

Maureen  M.  Lin  is  a  permanent  employee  in  the  children’s  center.  The 
district  will  not  lay  off  Ms.  Lin. 

2. 

Not  later  than  March  15,  2004,  in  accordance  with  sections  44949  and  44955 

of  the  Education  Code,’  the  superintendent  caused  the  governing  board  of  the  district  and 
respondents  —  except  for  respondents  Margaret  K.  Burns  and  Jessie  Bunn  --  to  be  notified  in 
writing  that  it  was  recommended  that  respondents  be  notified  that  the  district  would  not 
require  their  services  for  the  ensuing  school  year.  The  notice  stated  the  reasons  for  the 
recommendation.  The  recommendation  was  not  related  to  respondents’  competency. 

3. 

A  notice  was  delivered  to  each  respondent  —  except  for  respondents  Margaret 

K.  Burns  and  Jessie  Bunn  --  either  by  personal  delivery  or  by  depositing  the  notice  in  the 
United  States  mail,  registered,  postage  prepaid,  and  addressed  to  respondent’s  last  known 
address.  In  the  case  of  Ms.  Burns,  the  district  sent  no  notice  and  has  agreed  that  she  will  not 
be  laid  off. 
In  the  case  of  Ms.  Bunn,  the  district  deposited  a  notice  in  the  mail  on  March  12 
with  $4.42  postage  on  it.  The  post  office  returned  the  envelope  to  the  district  with  a  note 
saying  “postage  due  46  ¢”.  On  March  22,  the  district  added  46  cents  postage  and  mailed  the 
notice  again.  It  is  found  that  the  district  failed  to  provide  the  notice  that  the  code  requires. 
This,  however,  is  of  no  consequence,  because  Ms.  Bunn  is  a  temporary  employee.  The 
district  sent  precautionary  notices  to  temporary  employees  because  of  the  possibility  that  the 
district’s  records  concerning  an  employee’s  temporary  status  might  be  incorrect.  And  the 
notice  the  district  sent  Ms.  Bunn  was  merely  a  precautionary  notice. 

  

  

"  All  references  to  the  Code  are  to  the  Education  Code  unless  otherwise  specified. 

  

 
  

4. 

The  notice  advised  respondents  of  the  following:  A  respondent  has  a right  to  a 

hearing.  In  order  to  obtain  a  hearing,  a  respondent  had  to  deliver  a  request  for  a  hearing  in 
writing  to  the  person  sending  the  notice.  The  request  had  to  be  delivered  by  March  22,  2004, 
which  was  not  less  than  seven  days  after  the  notice  of  termination  was  served.  And  the 
failure  to  request  a  hearing  would  constitute  a  waiver  of  the  right  to  a  hearing. 

5. 

Each  respondent  —  except  for  respondents  Margaret  K.  Burns  and  Jessie  Bunn 

--  timely  filed  a  written  request  for  a  hearing  to  determine  whether  there  was  cause  for  not 
reemploying  him  or  her  for  the  ensuing  year.  An  accusation  was  timely  served  on  each 
respondent.  Each  respondent  filed  a  timely  notice  of  defense. 

6. 

The  original  recommendation  was  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of 

services  by  110.4  full  time  equivalent  positions  (FTE).  The  parties,  by  and  through  their 
counsel,  stipulated  that  the  recommendation  should  be  modified.  The  modifications 
eliminated  the  recommendation  regarding  certain  positions  and  changed  the  number  of  FTE 
regarding  other  positions.  The  original  recommendation,  with  the  modifications  written  on 
it,  is  attached  as  Attachment  C,  which  consists  of  two  pages.  In  category  I,  the 
recommendation  was  modified  to  eliminate  the  recommendation  regarding  items  I(b),  I(h), 
I(j),  I1(k),  and  I().  The  recommendation  was  modified  regarding  item  I(e)  to  change  the 
number  of  FTE  from  2  to  1.  The  recommendation  was  modified  regarding  item  II(a)  to 
change  the  number  of  FTE  from 9  to  7.5.  The  recommendation  was  modified  to  eliminate 
the  recommendation  regarding  item  VI(c).  That  changed  the  total  number  of  FTE  to  110.4 
less  8.5,  which  equals  101.9. 

7. 

Within  the  meaning  of  section  44955  of  the  Code,  the  services  are  “particular 

kinds  of  services”  that  can  be  reduced  or  discontinued.  The  recommendation  to  reduce  or 
discontinue  these  services  was  not  arbitrary  or  capricious  but  constituted  a  proper  exercise  of 
discretion. 

8. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  relates  to  the 

welfare  of  the  district  and  its  students.  The  reduction  or  discontinuation  is  necessary  in  order 
to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  district. 

9. 

By  a  resolution  dated  March  4,  2003,  the  governing  board  of  the  district 

adopted  needs-based  criteria  for  assigning  relative  rankings  for  laying  off  employees  who 
share  a  date  of  first  rendering  paid  service.  The  board  further  resolved  that,  if  there  were 
further  ties  after  applying  the  criteria,  those  further  ties  should  be  resolved  by  lottery.  After 
the  district  applied  the  needs-based,  tie  breaking  criteria,  there  were  further  ties.  The  district 
broke  these  further  ties  with  lotteries. 

10. 

Respondents  contend  that  a  district  must  consider  positively  assured  attrition 

in  deciding  how  many  employees’  services  are  subject  to  termination.  The  district  has 
received  notification  that  a  number  of  certificated  employees  will  resign  or  retire  effective 
the  end  of  the  current  school  year.  Respondents  contend  that  this  positively  assured  attrition 
must  be  used  to  reduce  the  number  of  respondents  subject  to  termination.  Subdivision  (b)  of

    

section  44955  of  the  Code  provides  for  two  types  of justification  for  terminating  employees’ 
services.  One  justification  concerns  a  decline  or  anticipated  decline  in  average  daily 
attendance  (ADA).  The  other  justification  concerns  a  reduction  in  or  discontinuation  of  a 
particular  kind  of  service  (PKS).  Complainant  acknowledges  that  a  school  district  must 
consider  positively  assured  attrition  when  the  justification  for  terminating  services  is  a 
decline  or  anticipated  decline  in  ADA.  The  termination  of  services  in  this  case,  however,  is 
justified  by  a  reduction in  or  discontinuation  of  PKS.  And  complainant,  citing  San  Jose 
Teachers  Association  v.  Allen,’  contends  that  attrition  need  not  be  considered in  a  PKS 
layoff. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1, 

Jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists  under  sections  44949  and  44955  of  the  Code. 

Except  as  to  respondents  Margaret  K.  Burns  and  Jessie  Bunn,  all  notice  and  jurisdictional 
requirements  contained  in  those  sections  were  satisfied. 

2. 

it  shall  have  become  necessary  by  reason  of any  of 

Must  a  district  consider  positively  assured  attrition  in  deciding  how  many 
employees’  services  are  subject  to  termination?  Subdivision  (b)  of  section  44955  of  the 
Code  provides  that,  when  a  school  district  has  experienced  a  decline  in  its  average  daily 
attendance  or  when a particular  kind  of  service  is  to  be  reduced  or  eliminated,  “and  when  in 
the  opinion  of the  governing  board  ... 
these  conditions  to  decrease  the  number  of  permanent  employees  in  the  district,  the 
governing  board  may  terminate  the  services  of  not  more  than  a  corresponding  percentage  of 
the  certificated  employees  of  the  district...”  (Emphasis  added.)  In  Burgess  v.  Board  of 
Education’  the  court  held  that  “normal attrition”  must  be  used  to  offset  layoffs  justified  by  a 
decline in  ADA  since  ignoring  such  attrition  “results in  a  reduction in  force  not  necessarily 
required  by  decline in  average  daily  attendance.”  Two  years  later,  citing  Burgess,  the  court 
in  Lewin  v.  Board  of  Trustees*  held  that,  “because  the  number  of  employees  may  be  reduced 
only  when  it  is  ‘necessary’  to  do  so,  the  governing  board  must  consider  normal  attrition  in 
the  work  force  as  a  part  of  any  reduction  in  employment.”’  (Emphasis  added.)  Reasoning 
that  “[bloard  members  are  not  soothsayers,”  the  court  held  that  a  district  must  consider  only 
“positively  assured  attrition,”  that  is,  attrition  known  to  the  board  by  the  time  of  its  final 
determination  on  or  before  May  15.  A  district  need  not  consider  “potential  attrition,”  that  is, 
retirements  and  resignations  that  are  expected  to  occur  before  the  beginning  of  the  next 
school  year.

Moreland  Teachers  Association  v.  Kurze,°  concerned  notices  that  cited  both 

ADA  and  PKS  as  the  grounds  for  termination.  In  discussing,  the  attrition  issue,  however,  the 
court  focused  on  the  ADA  ground.  In  calculating  the  number  of  employees  to  be  laid  off,  the 
school  district  had  considered  attrition  occurring  before  the  initial  notice  date  of  March  15. 
The  respondents  contended  that  the  district  was  required  to  consider  attrition  occurring 
between  March  15  and  May  15,  also.  The  district  contended  that  it  was  not  required  to  do 
that. 

In  Moreland,  the  court  elaborated  on  the  Lewin  holding. 

4. 

In  San  Jose  v.  Allen,  the  case  on  which  complainant  relies,  the  court  held  that  a 

School  district is  not  required  to  consider  attrition  in  a  PKS  layoff. 

Acknowledging  actual  attrition  occurring  between  March  15  and 
May  15  to  reduce  the  number  of  employees  to  be  laid  off  results 
in  no  prejudice  to  the  school  district,  while  sparing  that  number 
of  employees  unnecessary  termination  of  employment. 

.  We  see  no  legal  or  practical  impediment  to  revising 

downward  the  number  of  needed  terminations  resulting  from 
events  occurring  in  the  intervening  two  months.  On  the 
contrary,  there  is  sound  reason  to  do  so,  as  otherwise  the 
reduction  in  force  for  the  ensuing  school  year  would  be  greater 
than  that  necessitated  by  the  decline  in  attendance.’ 

A  board’s  decision  as  to  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  a 
particular  kind  of  service  is  not  tied  in  with  any  statistical 
computation,  such  as  reduction  in  the  number  of  students.  The 
number  of  terminations  made  necessary  by  PKS  reductions 
depends  totally  upon  the  district’s  decision  as  to  how  many 
services  to  reduce.  Put  another  way,  the  language  of  section 
44955  that  the  governing  board  of  a  school  district  “may 
terminate  the  services  of  not  more  than  a  corresponding 
percentage  of  the  certificated  employees  of  said  district”  is  only 
applicable  to  ADA  terminations  based  upon  an  actual  reduction 
in  attendance.  Where  the  governing  board  determines  to 
discontinue  or  reduce  a  particular  kind  of  service,  there  is  no 
way  to  calculate  a  “corresponding  percentage,”  hence  it  is 
within  the  discretion  of  the  board  to  determine  the  amount  by 
which  it  will  reduce  a  particular  service.

. 

In  PKS  cases  the  determination  of the  amount  by  which  a 
service  is  to  be  reduced  is  the  determination  of  the  number  of 
positions  to  be  eliminated. 

. 

In  making a final  decision  on  PKS  reductions,  the  extent  to 

which  the  services  are  reduced  inherently  determines  the 
number  of  positions  to  remain.  If  a  service  is  to  be  eliminated, 
for  example,  it  is  obvious  that  it  is  unnecessary  to  consider 
attrition  in  any  way.*® 

5. 

In  deciding  that  a  school  district is  not  required  to  consider  attrition  ina  PKS 
layoff,  the  San  Jose  court  focused  on  only  part  of  the  language  of  subdivision  (b)  of  section 
44955.  The  court  focused  on  the  provision  that  “[T]he  governing  board  may  terminate  the 
services  of  not  more  than  a  corresponding  percentage  of  the  certificated  employees  in  the 
district.”  And,  as  the  court  said,  that  language  can  apply  only  to  ADA  terminations.  When a  _ 
governing  board  decides  to  discontinue  or  reduce  a  particular  kind  of  service,  there  is  no  way 
to  calculate  a  “corresponding  percentage.”  But  the  court  was  mistaken  in  concluding  that  it 
follows  that  it  is  unnecessary  to  consider  attrition  in  PKS  cases.  The  court  was  mistaken, 
because  other  language  in  subdivision  (b)  should  be  considered.  In  both  ADA  and  PKS 
cases,  employees’  services  may  be  terminated  only  when  termination  has  “become 
necessary”  and  only  when  that  necessity  is  “by  reason  of’  the  ADA  or  PKS  condition.  In  an 
ADA  termination,  employees’  services  may  be  terminated  only  when,  in  the  opinion  of  the 
governing  board,  decreasing  the  number  of  permanent  employees  has  “become  necessary  by 
reason  of”  the  ADA  condition.  Similarly,  in  a  PKS  termination,  employees’  services  may  be 
terminated  only  when,  in  the  opinion  of  the  governing  board,  decreasing  the  number  of 
permanent  employees  has  “become  necessary  by  reason  of”  the  PKS  condition.  In  the  San 
Jose  case,  the  court  focused  solely  on  the  number  of  positions  to  be  reduced  and  on  the 
“corresponding  percentage”  language.  The  court  did  not  consider  whether  the  loss  of  a 
certain  number  of  positions  would,  in  all  cases,  cause  it  to  “become  necessary”  to  terminate 
the  services  of  an  equal  number  of  employees. 

6. 

Consider  the  following  illustration.  Assume  that  a  district  with  six  full-time 
music  teachers  decides  to  reduce  music  for  the  following  school  year  from  six  to  three  FTE. 
Because  of  that  reduction,  the  three  most  junior  music  teachers  would  be  laid  off. 
It  is  true, 
as  the  San  Jose  court  held,  that  the  reduction  from  six  to  three  positions  would  not  be 
affected  in  any  way  by,  for  example,  the  May  10  retirement  of  a  music  teacher.  For  the 
following  school  year  the  district  would  still  be  offering  only  half  as  many  music  courses  as 
it  does  in  the  current  school  year.  But  that  retirement  would  mean  that  the  PKS  condition  no 
longer  made  it  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  employees  by  three.  After  the 
retirement,  it  would  be  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  employees  only  by  two.  The 
decrease  regarding  the  third  position  would  be  accounted  for  by  attrition.

7. 

In  both  ADA  and  PKS  layoffs,  the  words  of  the  Moreland  court  hold  true. 

Considering  attrition  results  in  no  prejudice  to  the  district  and  spares  some  employees  from 
unnecessary  termination.  And  not  to  consider  attrition  would  result  in  a  greater  decrease  in 
the  number  of  employees  than  the  condition  necessitates. 

8. 

The  only  attrition  that  must  be  considered  is  attrition  that  creates  a  vacancy  in 

a  position  in  which  a  permanent  employee  would  be  qualified  to  serve. 

9. 

In  the  San  Jose  case,  the  court  said  that  whether  a  school  district  is  required  to 

consider  attrition  in  a  PKS  layoff  was  “an  issue  of  first  impression.”  The  court  noted  that 
courts  in  other  cases  had  held  that  a  school  district  is  required  to  consider  attrition  in  an  ADA 
layoff.  One  of  the  cases  the  San  Jose  court  cited  as  being  limited  to  ADA  layoffs  was  Lewin. 
But  in  fact,  Lewin  concerned  both  ADA  and  PKS.  The  Lewin  court  said,  “In  March  1974, 
following  a  two-year  decline  in  attendance  and  in  light  of planned  reductions  in  services,  the 
board  decided  not  to  re-employ  171  certificated  employees.”  (Emphasis  added.) 

10. 

As  noted  above,  the  Lewin  court  held: 

Because  the  number  of  employees  may  be  reduced  only  when  it 
is  “necessary”  to  do  so,  the  governing  board  must  consider 
normal  attrition  in  the  work  force  as  a  part  of  any  reduction  in 
employment.'°  (Emphasis  added.) 

11. 

Thus,  the  Lewin  court  --  ina  PKS  case,  that  is,  in  a  case  that  concerned  both 

ADA  and  PKS  layoffs  —  held  that  a  school  district  is  required  to  consider  attrition. 

12. 

The  San  Jose  court  mistakenly  read  Lewin  as  not  being  a  PKS  case.  Lewin 
was  decided  by  Division  Two  of  the  Second  Appellate  District  of  the  court.  San  Jose  was 
decided  by  Division  Five  of  the  First  Appellate  District  of  the  court.  Thus,  it  appears  there  is 
a  disagreement  between  those  districts  as  to  whether  a  school  district  is  required  to  consider 
attrition  in  a  PKS  layoff.  And  it  is  determined  that  the  Lewin  decision  is  more  faithful  to  the 
language  of  section  44955  and  should  be  followed. 

13. 

Within  the  terms  of  sections  44949  and  44955  of  the  Code,  the  district  has 
cause  to  reduce  or  discontinue  101.9  full  time  equivalent  positions  of  particular  kinds  of 
services  --  except  that  the  district  must  reduce  that  number  to  the  extent  there  is  positively 
assured  attrition  that  creates  vacancies  in  positions  in  which  permanent  employees  would  be 
qualified  to  serve.  The  cause  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils.
