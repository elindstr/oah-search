Henry H. Voros, Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources of the Moreno 
Valley Unified School District, made and filed the accusation dated March 26, 2010, in his 
official capacity as the designee of Rowena T. Lagrosa, Superintendent of Schools.

of attrition, subsequent dismissal or otherwise, by the conclusion of the hearing there remained 102 respondents, 
whom the district seeks to lay off.  These are named in Appendix A.  

The district initially identified 123 certificated employees as respondents designated for layoff.  By reason

3. 

On March 9, 2010, the Governing Board of the Moreno Valley Unified School 
District adopted Resolution 2009-10-43, determining that it would be necessary to reduce or 
discontinue particular kinds of services at the end of the current school year.  The board 
determined that the particular kinds of services that must be reduced for the 2010-2011 
school year were the following full time equivalent (FTE) positions: 

Full-Time Equivalent

 

 

 

 
Particular Kind of Service 
 
 
 
Elementary Teacher   K-5 
 
Continuing Education Teacher 
 
School Counselor 
Teacher on Assignment 
 
Teacher – Title I – Elementary Level 
 
Teacher – ELD/Specialist 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 

111 
0.60 
4.90 
1.00 
2.00 
3.60 

The proposed reductions totaled 123.10 FTE positions.  
 
4. 

The board further determined in Resolution No. 2009-10-43 that “for the 

purpose of assignment and reassignment to a language arts, math, science, or social studies 
position for middle school instruction, those persons assigned or reassigned to a language 
arts, math, science, or social science middle school instruction position shall possess a single 
subject credential or supplementary authorization in language arts, math, science, or social 
science.”  

The board directed the superintendent or her designee to determine which 

employees’ services would not be required for the 2010-2011 school year as a result of the 
reduction of the foregoing particular kinds of services.  The board further directed the 
superintendent or her designee to send appropriate notices to all certificated employees of the 
district who would be laid off as a result of the reduction of these particular kinds of services.  
 

6. 

On or before March 15, 2010, the district timely served on respondents a 
written notice that the superintendent had recommended that their services would not be 
required for the upcoming school year, an accusation, and related jurisdictional documents.  
The notice set forth the reasons for the recommendation.  The notice advised respondents of 
their right to a hearing, that each respondent had to deliver a request for a hearing in writing 
to the person sending the notice by the date specified in the notice, a date which in each case 
was more than seven days after the notice was served, and that the failure to request a 
hearing would constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing.  

 
The recommendation that respondents be terminated from employment was not 

related to their competency as teachers.  

 
All pre-hearing jurisdictional requirements were met. 

Respondents timely filed written requests for hearing and notices of defense.

Respondents are probationary or permanent certificated employees of the

district.  
 
 
“particular kinds of services” that could be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of 
Education Code section 44955.  The board’s decision to reduce or discontinue these 
particular kinds of services was not arbitrary or capricious and constituted a proper exercise 
of discretion.  No particular kinds of services were lowered to levels less than those levels 
mandated by state or federal law. 
 
 
The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related to the 
welfare of the district and its pupils.  The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of 
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the district as 
determined by the board.  
 
 
The board considered all positively assured attrition, including resignations, 
retirements and requests for transfer, in determining the actual number of necessary layoff 
notices to be delivered to its employees.

12. 

Lori Georg is a middle school sixth grade core teacher.2  She has a clear 

multiple subject credential with a supplementary authorization in English.  She believes that 
she is qualified to bump Gina Beloat, Ana McCauley, Marie Caouki, and Bonnie McMillan.  
Georg also testified that in 2005, she signed a document reflecting that she was NCLB (No 
Child Left Behind) compliant to teach middle school language arts beyond the sixth grade 
level.  

 
Beloat and McCauley presently teach sixth grade core, and were within the initial 

group of elementary teachers designated for layoff, but were able to bump more junior 
middle school language arts teachers because they are both NCLB compliant in middle 
school language arts, i.e., they are highly qualified to teach that subject through the eighth 
grade.  Caouki and McMillan presently teach middle school language arts and are also 
NCLB compliant in middle school language arts.  The district agreed that in 2005, Georg 
was highly qualified to teach middle school language arts.  However, the California 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) subsequently changed the requirements for 
NCLB compliance, so that Georg is now no longer highly qualified to teach seventh and 
eighth grade English.  Instead, she is only NCLB compliant for grades K to 6. 

 
Accordingly, the district’s determination that Georg could not bump into a middle 

school language arts position was proper. 

 
13.  Norma Hines teaches middle school language arts.  She has a multiple subject 

credential and subject matter authorization in English.  She was bumped by a more senior

are language arts and social studies.  In contrast, other middle school teachers, who teach at grades seven or eight, 
teach single subjects, such as language arts. 

Core teachers teach two different subjects to the same group of students.  In Georg’s case, the two subjects

elementary teacher who holds a multiple subject credential and supplementary authorizations 
in English and Spanish.  

 
Hines believes she can bump a more junior employee, Laura Luna, who teaches high 

school English, has a multiple subject credential, supplementary authorization in English, 
and special board authorization to teach secondary English granted pursuant to Education 
Code section 44263.  Hines also noted that she has passed her CSET (California Subject 
Examinations for Teachers) exam in secondary English and is in the process of completing 
the final course she needs to achieve a single subject credential in English.  With her subject 
matter authorization, Hines is presently NCLB compliant to teach English through ninth 
grade, but is not at this time (i.e., until passing her course) highly qualified to teach high 
school English beyond ninth grade.  In contrast, Luna, by virtue of her section 44263 
authorization, is highly qualified to teach high school English. 

 
Hines also expressed concern that she was bumped by an employee, Juan Borja-

Duarte, who is not himself NCLB compliant, but who only has a supplementary 
authorization to teach English.  In contrast, Hines has the more difficult to achieve subject 
matter authorization.  However, the supplementary authorization that Borja-Duarte holds is 
sufficient for teaching middle school English.3

 
Based on the foregoing, the district’s determination that Borja-Duarte could bump

multiple subject credential and a supplementary authorization in English.  She believes that 
she can bump Elizabeth Wilmot and Bonnie McMillan, middle school language arts teachers 
who, like Bissot, each have multiple subject credentials and supplementary authorizations in 
English.  Both Wilmot and McMillan are highly qualified to teach in their middle school 
assignments.  Bissot, on the other hand, though highly qualified to teach in her present 
assignment, is not highly qualified to teach at the middle school level.

well. 

In any event, for reasons not specified in the record, Borja-Duarte was ultimately designated for layoff as

proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to 
deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 
178-179.) 

Pursuant to section 44995, a senior teacher whose position is discontinued has 
the right to transfer to a continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to 
fill.  In doing so, the senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is 
filling that position.  (Lacy v. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469.)  
Junior teachers may be given retention priority over senior teachers if the junior teachers 
possess superior skills or capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack.  (Santa 
Clara Federation of Teachers, Local 2393 v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified 
School District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831, 842-843; Bledsoe v. Biggs Unified School Dist. 
(2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 127, 134-135.)  

 
The district has an obligation under section 44955, subdivision (b), to determine 

whether any permanent employee whose employment is to be terminated in an economic 
layoff possesses the seniority and qualifications which would entitle him/her to be assigned 
to another position.  (Bledsoe v. Biggs Unified School Dist., supra, at 136-137.) 

The decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is not tied in 

 
with any statistical computation.  It is within the governing authority’s discretion to 
determine the amount by which a particular kind of service will be reduced or discontinued 
as long as the district does not reduce a service below the level required by law.  (San Jose 
Teachers Assn. v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 635-636.)  A school district has wide 
discretion in setting its budget and a layoff decision will be upheld unless it was fraudulent or 
so palpably unreasonable and arbitrary as to indicate an abuse of discretion as a matter of 
law.  (California Sch. Employees Assn. v. Pasadena Unified Sch. Dist. (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 
318, 322.) 
 

5. 

School districts have broad discretion in defining positions within the district 

and establishing requirements for employment.  This discretion encompasses determining the 
training and experience necessary for particular positions.  Similarly, school districts have 
the discretion to determine particular kinds of services that will be eliminated, even though a 
service continues to be performed or provided in a different manner by the district.  
(Hildebrandt v. St. Helena Unified School Dist. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 334, 343.)

Education Code section 44263 provides: 

“A teacher licensed pursuant to the provisions of this article may be assigned, 

with his or her consent, to teach a single subject class in which he or she has 18 
semester hours of coursework or nine semester hours of upper division or graduate 
coursework or a multiple subject class if he or she holds at least 60 semester hours 
equally distributed among the 10 areas of a diversified major set forth in Section 
44314.  A three-semester-unit variance in any of the required 10 areas may be 
allowed.  The governing board of the school district by resolution shall provide 

 
 

 

5

specific authorization for the assignment.  The authorization of the governing board 
shall remain valid for one year and may be renewed annually.” 

7. 

A preponderance of the evidence sustained the charges set forth in the 

 
 
accusation.  Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the district to 
reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services.  The cause for the reduction or 
discontinuation of particular kinds of services related solely to the welfare of the schools and 
the pupils thereof.  Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees of the district 
due to the reduction and discontinuation of particular kinds of services.  The district 
identified the certificated employees providing the particular kinds of services that the Board 
be directed be reduced or discontinued.  It is recommended that the board give respondents 
notice before May 15, 2010, that their services are no longer required by the district. 
 
 

ADVISORY DETERMINATION 

The following advisory determination is made:  

The accusations served on respondents are sustained.  Notice may be given to 

 
 
respondents before May 15, 2010, that their services will not be required because of the 
reduction or discontinuation of particular services as indicated.
