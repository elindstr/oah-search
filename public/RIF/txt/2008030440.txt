2. 

Not  later  than  March  15,  2008,  in  accordance  with  Education  Code  sections 

44949  and  44955,°  the  superintendent  of  the  school  district  caused  the  governing  board  of  the 
district  and  respondents  to  be  notified  in  writing  that  it  was  recommended  that  respondents 
be  notified  that  the  district  would  not  require  their  services  for  the  ensuing  school  year.  The 
notice  stated  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation.  The  recommendation  was  not  related  to 
respondents’  competency.

3. 

A  notice  was  delivered  to  each  respondent,  either  by  personal  delivery  or  by 

depositing  the  notice  in  the  United  States  mail,  registered,  postage  prepaid,  and  addressed  to 
respondent’s  last  known  address. 

4. 

The  notice  advised  each  respondent  of  the  following:  He  or  she  had  a  right  to  a 

hearing.  In  order  to  obtain  a  hearing,  he  or  she  had  to  deliver  a  request  for  a  hearing  in 
writing  to  the  person  sending  the  notice.  The  request  had  to  be  delivered  by  March  17,  2008, 
which  was  not  less  than  seven  days  after  the  notice  of  termination  was  served.  And  the 
failure  to  request  a  hearing  would  constitute  a  waiver  of  the  right  to  a  hearing. 

5. 

Each  respondent  timely  filed  a  written  request  for  a  hearing  to  determine 

whether  there  was  cause  for  not  reemploying  him  or  her  for  the  ensuing  year.  An  accusation 
was  timely  served  on  each  respondent.  Each  respondent  filed  a  timely  notice  of  defense.  All 
prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  were  met. 

6. 

The  governing  board  of  the  district  resolved  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular 

kinds  of  services.  Within  the  meaning  of  Code  section  44955,  the  services  are  “particular 
kinds  of  services”  that  can  be  reduced  or  discontinued.  The  recommendation  to  reduce  or 
discontinue  these  services  was  not  arbitrary  or  capricious  but  constituted  a  proper  exercise  of 
discretion. 

7. 

The  governing  board  of  the  district  determined  that,  because  particular  kinds

permanent  employees  in  the  district.
