FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

The  ALJ  makes  the  following  Factual  Findings: 

1, 

On  March  8,  2005,  the  Board  of  Education  of  the  District  (the  Board) 

adopted  a  resolution  recommending  a  reduction  in  particular  kinds  of  services 
provided  by  the  district  for  the  2005-2006  school  year  due  to  a  decline  in  the  average 
daily  attendance  in  the  district.  (Exhibit  5.)  The  resolution  called  for  a  reduction  in 
services  equaling  70  Full-Time  Equivalent  (FTE)  positions.  The  resolution  called  for

    

_ 

the  following  reductions  in  particular  kinds  of  ervices:  “The  following  particular 
kinds  of  services  K-5  elementary  classes  -70  FTE  currently  being  provided  by  the 
_  District  shall  be  reduced  or  discontinued  due  to  declining  student  enrollment....” 

(Exhibit  5.) 

: 

. 

The  parties  do  not  dispute  the  fact  that  the  services  listed  above  are  particular 

kinds  of  services,  which  may  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of 
Education  Code  section  44955. 

2. 

The  district's  and  the  Board’s  decisions  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the 

services  listed  in  Finding  1,  above,  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious;  rather,  it  is  due 
to  the  decline  in  average  daily  attendance;  and,  is;  therefore,  a  proper  exercise  of  the 
district's  and  the  Board’s  discretion. 

: 

3. 

The  reduction  and  discontinuation  of  services  is  related  to  the  welfare 
of  the  District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of 
certificated  employees  as  determined  by  the  Board. 

. 

4. 

All  respondents  affected  by  the  layoffs  received  written  notice,  on  or  - 

before  March  15,  2005,  notifying  them  that  the  Superintendent  of  the  district  had 
recommended  they  not  be  re-employed  in  the  upcoming,  2005-2006,  school  year. 

S.~ 

Each  respondent  submitted  a  timely  request  for  a  hearing  to  determine 

if  cause  exists  for  not  re-employing  them  for  the  ensuing  year. 

. 

6. 

On  March  14,  2005  the  district's  Superintendent,  on  behalf  of  the 
district,  timely  notified  the  respondents,  pursuant  to  California  Education  Code 
sections  44949  and  44955,  of  the  district’s  intent  not  to  reemploy  them  for  the 
upcoming  school  year.  That  same  date,  March  14,  2005,  respondents  were  also 
served  with  a  copy  of  the  Board’s  resolution,  resolution  number  04/05-2600,  a  blank  — 
“Request  for  Hearing”,  the  accusation,  and  other  related  materials. 

Each  respondent  timely  submitted  a  Notice  of  Defense. 

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met. 

7. 

8. 

9. 

As  of  the  date  of  hearing  the  number  of  certificated  employees  affected 

by  the  layoffs  was  reduced  to  22,  due  to  attrition  (retirements,  etc.).  The  following 
respondents  remain:

- 

The  respondents  identified  in  Finding  9  have  been  selected  for  notice  of 

layoff  pursuant  to  a  seniority  list  based  on  the  first  day  of  paid  service  of  each 
respondent.  The  respondents  were  ranked  for  layoff  in  the  inverse  order  of  their  date 
of  employment.  As  to  respondents  who  have  the  same  date  of  hire/employment,  the 
district  used  appropriate,  written,  tie-breaking  criteria  to  rank  these  employees. 

11. 

Certain  respondents  identified  in  Finding  9  question  the  dates  used  by 
the  Board  and  the  district  as  their  “Seniority  Date”.  One  respondent,  Anthony  Heard, 
was  employed  under  an  emergency  permit/credential;  two  respondents,  Myriam  Deaz- 
Tinajero  and  Jose  Brito,  were  employed  as  Interns;  and  two  respondents,  Tammy: 
-Tourgemen  and  Carrie  Dozal  Carnie,  were  employed  as  temporary  contract  teachers. 
Each  of  these  respondents  received  non-reelection  notices  advising  them  that  their 
services  would  not  be  needed  during  the  2004/2005  school  year. Subsequently, in 
October — November  of  2004,  the  teachers  were  rehired  and  given  seniority  dates 
based  on  their  rehire  dates in  October/November  of  2004.  Respondents,  however, 
assert  that  they  should  have  received  credit  for  the  time  they  worked  under  an 
emergency  credential,  as  Interns,  and/or  as  temporary  contract  teachers. 

12. 

The  respondents  listed in  Finding  11  did  not  receive  any  credit  for  the 
time  they  worked  under  their  emergency  credentials,  as  Pre-Interns,  or  as  temporary 
contract  teachers  because  the  district  takes  the  position  that  since  the  respondents  | 
received  notices  of  non-reelection,  their  services  were  “dismissed”  and  their  seniority 

dates  became  the  dates  they  were  re-hired  in  October/November  of  2004.  

  

13. 

Four  of  the  respondents,  Rafael  Aberin,  Patricia  Kemp,  Charles  Burton, 
and  Kathleen  Clinton,  were  working  as  secondary  teachers  not  in  K-5;  however,  the  . 
district  noticed  them  because  they  have  multiple  subject  credentials  and  teachers  with — 
multiple  subject  credentials  may  teach  K-5;  therefore,  they  had  to  be  considered  in  the 
overall  mix  for  layoff. 

| 

. 

Respondents  highlight  the  fact  that  they  were  subjected  to  layoff 

because  other  secondary  teachers  with  multiple  subject  credentials  and  other  teaching 
authorizations  exercised  their  bumping  rights  to  “bump”  them.  Respondents  argue 
that  they  have  been  bumped  out  of  positions  teaching  in  secondary  school  that  are  not 
in  the  K-5  category  of  positions  subject  to  the  board  resolution. 

The  district  argues  that  since  70  FTE  in  the  K-5  category  were  being  ; 

eliminated  it  acted  properly  by  considering  all  teachers  in  the  district  who  were 
qualified  to  teach  K-5  and  eliminating  the  least  senior  of  those  teachers.  _ 

Respondents  counter  the  district’s  argument  by  pointing  to  the  fact  that 
if  the  district’s  position  is  adopted  by  the  fact  finder,  then  any  teacher  on  the  layoff  list 
who  is  senior  to  the  least  senior  respondent  who  was  retained  by  “bumping”  another 
respondent  (i.e.  Joseph  Pooler  who  has  a  seniority  date  of  11/15/04),  must  be  retained 
and  the  accusation  dismissed  as  to  them.  According  to  the  seniority  list  the  following 
respondents  are  affected  if  respondents’  position  is  correct:

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  for  the  instant  proceedings  exists  pursuant  to  Education 

Code  sections  44949  and  44955,  and  all  notices  and  other  requirements  of  those 
sections  have  been  provided,  as  required. 

2. 

The  services  listed  in  Factual  Finding  1  are  each  determined  to  be  a 

particular  kind  of  service  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955. 

3. 

Based  on  the  Factual  F indings,  considered  in  their  entirety,  cause  exists 
to  reduce  the  number  of  certified  employees  of  the  District  by  22  full-time  equivalent 
positions,  due  to  the  decline  in  average  daily  attendance.  (Findings  2  &  9.) 

4. 

Cause  to  reduce  or  discontinue  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of 
the  District's  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949. 
(Finding  3) 

5. 

Education  Code  (Code)  section  44848  addresses  the  issue  of  “breaks  in 

service”  raised  by  respondents  in  Factual  Findings  11  and  12.  Code  section  44848 
provides,  in  relevant  part: 

“When  an  employee’s  services  are  terminated  for  lack  of 
enrollment  or  discontinuance  of  service  or  are  otherwise  - 
interrupted  in  a  manner  declared  by  law  not  to  constitute 
a  break  in  service,  his  original  order  of  employment  shall 
stand.  (Emphasis  Added.) 

The  language  highlighted  in  the  above  quoted  excerpt  from  Code 

section  44848  referring  to  “otherwise  interrupted  in  a  manner  declared  by  law  not  to 
constitute  a  break  in  service”  does  not  include  releasing  or  non-reelecting  temporary  - 
teachers,  interns,  or  emergency  permit  teachers.  There  is  no  language  in  Code 
sections  44920  (temporary  teacher),  44911  (emergency permit  teacher)  or  44450- 
44468  and  44830.3  (Interns)  providing  that  non-reelection  or  release  is  not  a  break  in 
service  for  seniority  purposes.  Additionally,  there  are  no  other  code  sections  or  case 
law  providing  or  holding  that  non-reelection  or  release  from  service  is  not  a  break  in 
service  for  seniority  purposes.  Accordingly,  the  seniority  dates  were  properly 
established  by  the  district  for  all  respondents  who  were  non-reelected  teachers  holding 
emergency  permits,  or  who  were  temporary,  or  who  were  interns... 

The  respondents  who  were  in  the  category  described  in  this  legal 

conclusion  also  argue  that  the  district  improperly  used  the  non-reelection  notices  to 
circumvent  their  right  to  a  hearing.  Their  argument,  which  is  based  on  Cousins  v. 
Weaverville  Elementary  School  Dist.  (1994)  24  Cal.App.4"  1846,  is  as  follows:  A 
district  ordinarily  may  elect  not  to  retain  a  probationary  employee  and  it  need  not

assert  a  reason,  but  where  it  is  undisputed  that  termination  was  prompted  by  economic 
conditions  described  in  Code  section  44955 ,  the  district  must  provide  notice  and  a 
right  to  a  hearing  as  prescribed  by  Code  section  44949.  Thus,  it  is  impermissible  to 
_  use  a  notice  of  non-reelection  as  a  means  of  effecting  an  economic  layoff. 

| 

-  Though  novel,  respondents’  contention  fails  for  the  following  reasons: 

1) 
The  notices  of  non-reelection  occurred  at  the  end 
of  the  2003/2004  school  year.  The  notices  informed  the 
teachers  that  their  services  would  not  be  needed  during 
the  2004/2005  school  year;  however,  due  to  need,  they 
were,  in  fact  re-hired  in  October  and  November  of  2004. 
Those  events  occurred  a  year  ago  and  respondents’ 
current  objection  to  those  notices  of  non-reelection  is  not 
timely; 

2) 
The  Cousins  case  concerns  probationary 
employees,  not  temporary  employees,  employees  with 
emergency  permits,  or  interns;  and, 

No  evidence  was  presented  that  the  non-reelection 

3) 
notices  were  prompted  by  economic conditions. 

6. 

As  noted  in  Factual  Finding  13,  four  respondents,  Rafael 

Aberin,  Patricia  Kemp,  Charles  Burton,  and  Kathleen  Clinton,  were  working  as  . 
secondary  teachers  not  in  K-5;  however,  the  district  noticed  them  because  they  have 
multiple  subject  credentials  and  teachers  with  multiple  subject  credentials  may  teach 
K-5;  therefore,  they  had  to  be  considered  in  the  overall  mix  for  layoff. 

Respondents  highlight  the  fact  that  they  were  subjected  to  layoff 

because  other  secondary  teachers  with  multiple  subject  credentials  and  other  teaching 
authorizations  exercised  their  bumping  rights  to  “bump”  them.  Respondents  argue 
that  they  have  been  bumped  out  of  positions  teaching  in  secondary  school  that  are  not 
in  the  K-S  category  of  positions  subject  to  the  board  resolution. 

There  is  nothing  wrong  with  the  fact  the  district  considered  all  teachers 
qualified  to  teach  K-5  to  create  its  layoff  list  based  on  seniority.  Since  70  FTE  in  the 
K-5  category  were  being  eliminated  the  district  acted  properly  by  considering  all 
teachers  in  the  district  who  were  qualified  to  teach  K-5  and  eliminating  the  least 
senior  of  those  teachers.  However,  once  the  district  made  its  decision  to  create  a 
seniority  layoff  list  based  on  all  teachers  qualified  to  teach  K-5  it  should  have  then 
eliminated  the  70  least  senior  of  those  teachers.  A  comparison  of  the  overall  seniority 
list  (Exhibit  4)  with  the  “list  of  22”  noticed  employees  (Exhibit  14)  reveals  that  the 
district  did  not  comply  with  its  own  policy  determination.  Specifically,  Exhibit  4 

 

_. 

indicates  that  Joseph  Pooler  (employee  no.  2767)  is  a  probationary  teacher  with  a 
Seniority  date  of  11/15/04.  Pooler  was  allowed  to  “bump”  Kathleen  Clinton 
(employee  no.  2786).  Accordingly,  Pooler  was  not  slated  for  layoff  even  though 
respondents  with  more  seniority  were.  Those  respondents  and  their  seniority  dates  are 

.  as  follows:

Consequently,  what  is  commonly  referred  to  as  the  “Domino  effect”  shall 

apply  and  all  employees  on  the  “list  of  22”  as  senior,  or  more  senior,  than  the  least 
senior  teacher  (Pooler)  who  “bumped”  into  the  classroom  (seniority  dates  on  or  before 
11/15/04)  shall  be  deemed  reemployed.  The  accusation  is  dismissed  as  to  those 
respondents.
