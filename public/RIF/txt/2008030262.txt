Marilyn  Chandler,  Norma  Ruth  Llerena,  and 
Erin  M.  Murphy, 

Respondents. 

PROPOSED  DECISION 

This  matter  was  heard  by  Mark  E.  Harman,  Administrative  Law  Judge  of  the  Office 

of  Administrative  Hearings,  State  of  California,  on  April  18,  2008,  in  Rowland  Heights, 
California. 

Jonathan  A.  Pearl,  Attorney  at  Law,  represented  the  Rowland  Unified  School  District 

(District).  Glenn  Rothner,  Attorney  at  Law,  represented  Marilyn  Chandler,  Norma  Ruth 
Llerena,  and  Erin  M.  Murphy  (Respondents). 

The  District  decided  to  reduce  or  discontinue  certain  educational  services  and  gave 
Respondents  and  other  certificated  District  employees  notice  of  its  intent  not  to  reemploy 
them  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  Respondents  requested  a  hearing  for  a  determination  of 
whether  cause  exists  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

Oral  and  documentary  evidence  was  received.  The  record  was  left  open  until  April 

23,  2008,  to  allow  Respondents,  and  April  24,  2008,  to  allow  the  District,  to  submit  post- 
hearing  briefs.  Both  briefs  were  timely  received  and  considered  by  the  administrative  law 
judge.  The  matter  was  submitted  for  decision  on  April  25,  2008.

(RIF  notice)  on  13  certificated  employees,  including  Respondents,  that  their  services  would

Cox  rescinded  her  request  for  a  hearing  on  March  19,  2008.  Certificated  employee  Michael 
Florido  did  not  request  a  hearing.  The  District  was  able  to  reassign  all  certificated 
management  employees  who  received  notices.

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met.

9. 

The  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number  3  are  particular  kinds  of 

services  which  may  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  (the 
Code)  section  44955.! 

10. 

The  Governing  Board  took  action  to  reduce  the  services  set  forth  in  factual 

finding  number  3  primarily  because  of  the  uncertainty  surrounding  State  funding.  The 
decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor 
capricious  but  is  rather  a  proper  exercise  of  the  District’s  discretion. 

11. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number 

3  is  related  to  the  welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to 
decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  as  determined  by  the  Governing  Board. 

12. 

On  March  4,  2008,  the  Governing  Board  adopted  criteria  for  determining  order 
of  seniority  of  those  employees  with  the  same  date  of  first  paid  service  (tie-breaking  criteria). 
The  tie-breaking  criteria  are  reasonable  as  they  relate  to  the  skills  and  qualifications  of 
certificated  employees.  The  criteria,  themselves,  were  not  challenged  by  Respondents. 

13a. 

Respondent  Norma  Llerena  (Llerena)  has  been  working  as  a  psychologist  for 
the  District  during  the  2007-2008  school  year.  She  does  not  dispute  that  her  seniority  date  is 
August  27,  2007.  Following  the  District’s  decision  to  reduce  2.0  FTE  positions  of 
psychologist  services  for  the  2008-2009  school  year,  the  District  gave  a  RIF  notice  to 
Llerena  as  the  last  school  psychologist  hired.  Since  there  was  one  vacant  position,  the 
District  did  not  give  a  RIF  notice  to  any  other  District  psychologist.  At  the  hearing,  Llerena 
challenged  the  accuracy  of  the  District’s  seniority  list. 

13b. 

Llerena  contends  that  the  first  date  of  paid  service  assigned  to  Olga  Sosa 

(Sosa),  a  certificated  school  psychologist  and  District  employee,  is  incorrect,  that  the  District 
employed  Sosa  on  March  17,  2007,  as  “a  substitute,  and  therefore,  temporary,  employee  for 
the  remainder  of  the  [2006-2007  school]  year,”  and  that  the  District  had  misclassified  Sosa’s 
2006-2007  employment  as  probationary.  Llerena  thus  contends  that  Sosa’s  seniority  date  is 
August  27,  2007,  the  same  as  Llerena’s.  The  District  maintains  that  Sosa’s  seniority  date  is 
March  12,  2007,  and  that  Sosa  is  a  more  senior  psychologist  whose  position  is  not  being 
eliminated  by  the  District.  Both  Llerena  and  Sosa  are  identified  in  the  District’s  seniority  list 
as  "PROB  1"  employees,  i.e.,  employees  in  their  first  year  of  probationary  status. 

13c. 

In  support  of  her  challenge,  Llerena  relies  on  the  District’s  records,  which 

indicate  Sosa  was  hired  during  the  second  half  of  the  2006-2007  school  year  to  fill  a  position

of  an  employee  who  had  resigned.  Sosa’s  contract  for  the  2007-2008  school  year  indicated 
she  was  hired  as  a  probationary  employee  at  that  time.  The  records  include:  (a)  a  District 
Personnel  Requisition  indicating  Sosa  was  hired  under  a  temporary  contract  to  begin  work  on 
March  12,  2007,  to  replace  an  employee  who  resigned;  (b)  the  District’s  Contract  and  Offer 
of  Temporary  Employment,  accepted  by  Sosa  on  March  6,  2007,  which  states  the  District 
was  offering  employment  to  Sosa  "as  a  temporary  teacher"  to  perform  “temporary  services” 
for  the  2006-2007  school  year  to  begin  on  March  12,  2007,  and  end  on  June  30,  2007,  and 
that,  “subject  to  acceptance”  and  “ratification,”  Sosa  was  "classified  by  the  Board  of 
Education  as  a  temporary  employee  pursuant  to  applicable  Education  Code  sections;”  and  (c) 
the  District’s  Initial  Offer  of  Employment  as  a  Probationary  Employee,  accepted  by  Sosa  on 
May  9,  2007,  indicating  that  the  District  offered  Sosa  "employment  as  a  probationary 
certificated  employee  in  the  position  of  school  psychologist  for  the  2007-08  school  year. 
Your  services  with  the  District  will  begin  on  8/27/07."  Thus,  the  District’s  own  contracts 
classified  Sosa  as  a  temporary  employee  for  the  2006-2007  school  year  and  as  a  probationary 
employee  for  the  2007-2008  school  year.  The  first  date  of  paid  service  for  all  probationary 
employees  hired  for  the  2007-2008  school  year  was  August  27,  2007.  The  code  provides,  in 
relevant  part,  that:  “As  between  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  district  on 
the  same  date,  the  governing  board  shall  determine  the  order  of  termination  solely  on  the 
basis  of  needs  of  the  district  and  the  students  thereof.”  (§  44955,  subd.  (b).)  The  District 
admittedly  has  not  determined  the  order  of  termination  between  Llerena  and  Sosa  based  on 
application  of  the  District’s  tie-breaking  criteria.  Llerena,  therefore,  asserts  that  the  District 
may  not  terminate  Llerena. 

13d. 

The  code  authorizes  the  Governing  Board  to  hire  and  classify  its  employees, 

but  also  imposes  limitations  on  its  decisionmaking  power.  The  code  establishes  four  possible 
classifications  for  certificated  employees:  permanent;  probationary;  temporary;  and 
substitute.  (Kavanaugh  v,  West  Sonoma  County  Union  High  School  Dist.  (2003)  29  Cal.4th 
911,  916-917.)  “The  classification  of  ‘probationary’  is  the  default  classification.  School 
districts  classify  all  teachers  as  probationary  who  are  not  otherwise  required  by  the  code  to 
be  classified  as  permanent,  temporary,  or  substitute.  (§  44915;  Bakersfield  Elementary 
Teachers  Assn.  v.  Bakersfield  City  School  Dist.  (2006)  145  Cal.App.4th  1260,  1280... 
(Bakersfield).  (Vasquez  v.  Happy  Valley  Union  School  Dist.  (2008)  159  Cal.App.4th  969, 
975  (Vasquez).)  In  Bakersfield,  the  Court  of  Appeal  ruled  that  a  district  could  classify 
teachers  based  only  on  the  grounds  provided  in  the  code.  (Jd.  at  p.  983.)  “Ifa  certificated 
employee  occupies  a  position  the  Code  defines  as  temporary,  he  or  she  is  a  temporary 
employee;  if  it  is  not  a  position  that  requires  temporary  classification  (or  permanent  or 
substitute),  he  or  she  is  a  probationary  employee.  (§  44915.)  The  Code  grants  school  districts 
no  discretion  to  deviate  from  this  statutory  classification  scheme.  [Citation.]”  (Jd.  at  p.  983, 
citing  Bakersfield,  145  Cal.App.4th  at  p.  1299.)  The  issue  here  is  whether,  under  the 
particular  facts  and  circumstance,  Sosa  was  a  probationary  employee  by  law  at  the  initial 
time  of  her  employment  in  March  2007.  If  so,  Llerena  is  the  most  junior  employee  and  may 
be  terminated  by  the  District  without  the  application  of  tie-breaking  criteria. 

13e. 

The  code  requires  a  school  district  to  classify  as  substitute  employees  those 

teachers  employed  "to  fill  positions  of  regularly  employed  persons  absent  from  service,"  but 

 

  

provides  no  other  ground  for  this  classification.  (§  44917.)  The  evidence  was  substantial  that 
Sosa  was  hired  to  replace  an  employee  who  resigned,  not  merely  absent  or  on  leave  for  a 
long-term  illness.  The  District’s  personnel  requisition  form  and  the  testimony  of  the 
District’s  coordinator  of  human  resources,  Ms.  Fisher,  who  was  responsible  for 
implementation  of  the  technical  aspects  of  the  layoff,  both  support  a  finding  that  Sosa 
replaced  an  employee  who  resigned.  Further,  the  District  requested  information  from  each 
staff  member  to  ensure  the  accuracy  of  seniority  dates  in  its  records  before  creating  the 
seniority  list. 
District’s  calculation  of  her  (Sosa’s)  seniority  date  of  March  12,  2007,  was  correct. 

In  response,  Sosa  signed  a  document  on  February  6,  2008,  affirming  that  the 

13f. 

Sosa  did  not  occupy a  position  that  required  a  temporary  or  substitute 

classification  when  she  was  first  hired.  Respondent  has  provided  no  statutory  basis  on  which 
the  District  could  have  classified  Sosa  as  a  substitute  or  temporary  employee  in  March  2007. 
Sosa, therefore,  was a  probationary  employee  at  the  initial  time  of  her  employment  with  the 
District. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  for  the  subject  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  sections  44949  and 

44955,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  |  through  8. 

2. 

The  services  listed  in  factual  finding  number 3  are  particular  kinds  of  services 

that  could  be  reduced  or  discontinued  under  section  44955. 

3. 

4. 

Respondent  Llerena  argues  that  the  District  incorrectly  assigned  a  seniority 

date  to  Sosa  that  was  earlier  than  the  date  assigned  to  Llerena,  and  as a  result,  the  District  has 
deprived  Llerena  of  her  right  to  have  the  Board  determine  the  order  of  termination  as 
between  Llerena  and  Sosa  on  the  basis  of  tie-breaking  criteria.  For  the  reasons  set  forth  in 

Cause  exists  for  the  District  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of 
services  listed  in  factual  finding  number  3,  which  cause  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the 
District's  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  section  44949,  as  set  forth  in  factual  finding 
numbers  |  through  11. 

    
 

>  Respondent  principally  relies  on  the  District’s  characterization  of  Sosa’s  status  in 
the  employment  contract  as  “temporary,”  and  the  presumption  “that  official  duty  has  been 
regularly  performed.”  (Evid.  Code,  §  664.)  But  “[s]ince  Balen,  appellate  courts  have 
interpreted  the  temporary  classifications  narrowly  —  so  much  so  that  if  a  teacher  does  not 
satisfy  the  statutory  grounds  for  a  temporary  classification,  the  default  or  catchall  provision 
of  section  44915  mandates  the  district  classify  the  teacher  as  a  probationary  employee. 
(California  Teachers  Assn.  v.  Vallejo  City  Unified  School  Dist.  (2007)  149  Cal.App.4th  135, 
146,  150...  In  other  words,  it  is  no  longer  the  case  that  a  school  district  and  a  teacher  are 
free  to  negotiate  a  teachers’  classification  in  cases  of  a  statutory  gap.”  (Vasquez,  supra,  159 
Cal.App.4th  at  p.  983.)  Respondent’s  other  arguments  were  not  persuasive. 

  

factual  finding  number  13a  through  13f,  Respondent  Llerena  has  failed  to  demonstrate  that 
the  District’s  calculation  of  Sosa’s  seniority  date  is  incorrect. 

5. 

Cause  exists  to  terminate  the  services  of  Respondents,  Marilyn  Chandler,  Norma 

Ruth  Llerena,  and  Erin  M.  Murphy,  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of 
particular  kinds  of  services,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  1  through  13f,  and  legal 
conclusion  numbers  |  through  4. 

ORDER 

The  Accusation  is  sustained  and  the  District  may  notify  Respondents,  Marilyn 
Chandler,  Norma  Ruth  Llerena,  and  Erin  M.  Murphy,  that  their  services  will  not  be  needed 
during  the  2008-2009  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services.
