FACTUAL FINDINGS

Procedural and jurisdictional issues

1.

At hearing the District amended the Accusation as to respondent Patricia

Radenbaugh by withdrawing 0.20 full-time equivalent (F.T.E.) of the 0.85 (F.T.E.) school
nurse. Consequently, the District will eliminate the equivalent of 0.65 F.T.E. school nurse.

2.

On March 8, 2012, the Board of Trustees of the Southern Humboldt Unified
School District (District) adopted Resolution No. 12-1112, in which the Board resolved to
reduce or discontinue the following particular kinds of services at the end of the 2011-2012
school year as follows:

Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Landscape Art.
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Multimedia (ROP).
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.40 (F.T.E.) Art.
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Ceramics.
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Applied Math (ROP).
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Business Algebra (ROP).
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) CTE Rotation.
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Accounting (ROP).
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Entrepreneurship (ROP).
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Madd Jazz.
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Band.
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Band/Choir.
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Drama.
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.20 (F.T.E.) Broadcast Journalism (ROP).
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.65 (F.T.E.) School Nurse.
Eliminate the equivalent of 1.00 (F.T.E.) Elementary (Redway)
Eliminate the equivalent of 1.00 (F.T.E.) Elementary (Agnes Johnson).
Eliminate the equivalent of 1.00 (F.T.E.) Elementary (Ettersburg).
Eliminate the equivalent of 0.50 (F.T.E.) Elementary (Casterlin).

The resolution directed the District’s superintendent, or his designee, to initiate

procedures to not reemploy the equivalent of 7.351 full-time equivalent certificated
employees of this district pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.

3.

On March 9, 2012, District Superintendent Jim Stewart sent notices to nine

certificated employees of his recommendation that their services would be reduced or
discontinued for the 2012-2013 school year. Two of those employees requested a hearing to
determine if cause exists not to re-employ them. Respondent Patricia Radenbaugh filed a
notice of defense. However, Respondent Paul Schmollinger did not file a notice of defense.
At hearing, the District stipulated to jurisdiction and stipulated that respondent Paul
Schmollinger could present his case at hearing. Two employees Patricia Radenbaugh and
Paul Schmollinger are the remaining respondents in this proceeding.

4.

5.

The parties stipulated that the District has complied with all procedural

requirements of Education Code section 44949 and 44955.

The Board’s decision to reduce 7.35 F.T.E. positions is based on a

combination of declining enrollment, an elimination of transportation funds during the
second half of the fiscal year, that have since been restored, and an anticipated loss of
revenue from the State of California for the 2012-2013 school year.

1 The 7.35 F.T.E. was reduced at hearing to 7.05 F.T.E., to reflect the withdrawal of

0.20 F.T.E’s from Patricia Radenbaugh.

2

6.

Respondent Paul Schmollinger holds a 0.80 F.T.E. high school teaching

position. On the District’s seniority list his credential is listed as “Single Subject – Music”.
Respondent is a permanent teacher. There is no issue as to respondent’s right to bump other
teachers and consequently, the tie breaking criteria is not applicable.

7.

No certificated employee junior in seniority to respondent Schmollinger is

being retained by the District to perform services that respondents are certificated and
competent to render.

8.

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services is related to the

welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof.

Jim Stewart

9.

Jim Stewart was present and testified at hearing. Stewart is the District

Superintendent for the Southern Humboldt Unified School District. In addition to being the
District Superintendent, Stewart is also the Principal for Casterlin Elementary School
(kindergarten through eighth grade), Principal of Southern Fork Junior/Senior High School,
and superintendent for four other elementary schools, and the director of transportation.
Stewart made his recommendations to the Board to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of
services. Stewart is aware that the District is responsible for providing mandated services
and believes that the District will be able to provide the mandated services after the reduction
of 7.05 F.T.E. while maintaining a 0.2 F.T.E. school nurse.

Paul Schmollinger

10.

Respondent Schmollinger testified at hearing that in his school, student

enrollment has diminished over the past year. Currently Respondent Schmollinger teaches
performing arts at South Fork High School. Respondent’s subjects include drama,
intermediate and advanced ensemble, band and an eighth grade, year long class, (half of the
year instructing on instruments, and the remaining half of the year, on vocal skills).
Respondent Schmollinger is not aware of any junior certificated District employee who was
retained by the District. Respondent did not present any evidence at hearing that support any
bumping rights. Respondent Schmollinger is unaware of any authority or evidence that
would require the District to maintain his position.

Patricia Radenbaugh

11.

Respondent Patricia Radenbaugh, R.N., holds a 0.85 full-time equivalent

school nurse position. Radenbaugh has a seniority date of August 26, 2005. She is the only
school nurse employed by the District. Under the resolution, respondent Radenbaugh’s 0.85
school nurse position would be reduced to 0.20.

3

12.

The District is providing nursing services through respondent Radenbaugh as
well as by contracting for nursing services with the Humboldt County Office of Education.
Stewart acknowledged the District’s obligation to provide all mandated school nurse services
for its students. Stewart believes the mandated school nurse services can be accomplished by
utilizing respondent Radenbaugh’s 0.20 F.T.E. school nurse services in combination with the
nursing services available through the Humboldt County Office of Education. The District
believes that not all services provided by respondent Radenbaugh are services mandated to
be provided by a school nurse. For the school year 2012-2013, the District will provide
nursing services through Radenbaugh and by contracting with the Humboldt County Office
of Education. Stewart also has determined that the district will be able to provide all
required vision, hearing, and required screening. (Ed. Code, §§ 49452, 49452.5.) In the
event that the District cannot provide sufficient nursing services, the District will increase
respondent Radenbaugh’s position.

13.

Radenbaugh contends that the District will not be able to provide all mandated

nursing services for 2012-2013 school year. Radenbaugh contends that she is already
stretched to the limit in covering the District’s schools, and Radenbaugh feels compromised
in the services that she is providing to students. She believes that the needs of the District’s
students compel the continuance of her nursing services. Radenbaugh presented evidence at
hearing that she is the only qualified registered nurse in the District who can administer
insulin injections. She currently provides daily services throughout the day to three diabetic
students.

14.

The evidence establishes that many of the nursing services currently being

offered by the District to its students are not mandated services. It was not established that
mandated services are being reduced below the level required by law by reason of the 0.65
F.T.E. reduction in school nursing services. With respect to the screening services, it is not
required that they be provided by a certificated school nurse. Finally, a particular kind of
service of an employee may be eliminated even if the service continues to be performed or
provided by the district in a different manner. (See e.g., Campbell Elementary Teachers
Assn., Inc. v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 812; accord Gallup v. Board of Trustees
(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1571, 1586-1587; San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen (1983) 144
Cal.App.3d 627, 639-640.)

15.

No certificated employee junior in seniority to respondent Radenbaugh is

being retained by the district to perform services that respondents are certificated and
competent to render.

16.

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services is related to the

welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof.
