 Total FTEs 
 
 
 
The Board further determined that it will be necessary to terminate at the end of the 
 
2009  –  2010  school  year  the  employment  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  in  a 
quantity and kind equal to the FTEs specified above. 
 
 
The  Board  further  adopted  tie-breaking  criteria  to  distinguish  among  certificated 
employees who first rendered paid probationary service to the District on the same date.  The 
tie-breaking criteria provided points for possession of credentials as follows:   
 

73.2

2 points for intern credential 
1 point for provisional internship permit or short-term staff   
permit   
1 point for Bilingual Cross-Cultural Language and Development 
certificate or equivalent 

5. 

The services set forth in the PKS resolution are particular kinds of services 

that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44945.  
None of the reductions is of a mandated service.  
 

 

 

                                                 
1  Full-Time Equivalent.

6. 

Each respondent was given written notice of his/her employment status, 

seniority date and credentials by posting and circulating the District certificated seniority list. 
Each respondent was asked to verify his/her credentials and hire date.   
 

7. 

The District created a list of employees proposed to be laid off, “bumped,” or 

reassigned, taking into account the tie-breaking criteria, positively-assured attrition 
(including resignations, retirements, and deaths), leaves of absence and extensions of leaves 
of absence, and non-reelections of temporary employees.

competent to render.

the remaining respondents, i.e. those whose accusations have not been rescinded, that their 
services will not be required for the 2010 – 2011 school year.  This cause solely relates to the 
welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof within the meaning of Education Code section 
44949.
