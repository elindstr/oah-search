Superintendent  Claudia  Plumley-Frandsen  of  the  Cloverdale  Unified  School 

District  (District)  filed  the  Accusation  in  her  official  capacity. 

Mary-Elizabeth  Kelly  and  Steven  Stewart  (Respondents)  are  permanent 

certificated  employees  of  the  District. 

By  letter  dated  March  10,  2004,  the  Superintendent  notified  the  District’s 

Board  of  Trustees  (Board)  that  she  recommended  that  certain  services  need  to  be  reduced  or 
eliminated  in  the  2004/2005  school  year. 

4. 

On  March  10,  2004,  the  Board  adopted  Resolution  Number  204-06.  The

The  proposed  reductions  total  five  full-time  equivalent  positions. 

5. 

By  letter  dated  and  hand  delivered  March  12,  2004,  the  Superintendent 

notified  Respondents  of  the  Board’s  resolution  and  that  his  or  her  services  would  be  reduced 
or  discontinued  in  2004/2005. 

Each  Respondent  made  a  timely  request  for  a  hearing. 

Accordingly,  an  Accusation  and  a  Notice  of  Hearing  were  prepared  and  timely  served 

on  each  Respondent. 

Each  Respondent  filed  a  timely  Notice  of  Defense  and  this  hearing  followed. 

6. 

The  reason  for  the  proposed  reduction  in  services  is  financial.  The  District  has 
been  on  “qualified  status”  with  its  county  office  of  education  for  five  years.  This  means  that 
the  District’s  budget  does  not  show  that  its  obligations  can  be  met  without  depleting  its 
savings.  The  District  has  been  advised  that  it  needs  to  cut  $600,000.00  in  two  years  in  order 
to  remain  solvent. 

Superintendent  Frandsen  testified  that  the  reductions  relate  solely  to  the  interests  of 

the  district  and  its  students.  The  District  will  continue  to  be  able  to  meet  state  standards, 
including  the  requirements  for  physical  education.  Further,  each  certificated  employees 
credentials,  status  and  place  on  the  “seniority  list”  was  carefully  considered.  Respondents  are 
both  subject  to  “bumping”  by  an  employee  with  more  seniority.

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  for  the  subject  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code 

sections  44949  and  44955,  and  all  notices  and  other  requirements  of  those  sections  have  been 
provided  as  required. 

2, 

Cause  exists  to  reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  Cloverdale 

Unified  School  District.  The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  services  is  related  solely  to  the 
welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  sections  44949 
and  44955.  The  services  are  “particular  kinds  of  services”  that  may  be  reduced  or 
discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955.  The  Board’s  decision 
was  not  arbitrary  or  capricious  and  was  a  proper  exercise  of  the  Board’s  discretion.  It  was 
not  demonstrated  that  the  reduction  will  cause  the  failure  to  comply  with  state  mandates. 

3. 

No  employee  with  less  seniority  than  either  Respondent  is  being  retained  to 

render  a  service  which  either  Respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

ORDER 

Notices  may  be  given  to  Respondents  Mary-Elizabeth  Kelly  and  Steven  Stewart  that 

their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2004-2005  school  year.
