matter on April 18, 2011, in Arcadia, California.

Margaret A. Chidester and Alexandria M. Davidson, Attorneys at Law, represented
Beverly Klatt, Ed.D. (Klatt), Director of Personnel Services of the Arcadia Unified School
District (District).

Glenn Rothner, Anthony Resnick, and Richa Amar, Attorneys at Law, represented all

respondent teachers identified in Appendix A attached hereto, and Brian Zurla, whom the

Klatt thereafter provided a written “Preliminary Notice Not To Reemploy”

(preliminary notice) to 115 certificated employees, including Respondents. The preliminary
notice states that it had been recommended to the Board, and the Board had determined, to give
a preliminary notice to each of these employees that their services would not be required for the
2011-2012 school year due to the Board’s decision to discontinue certain particular kinds of
services. Each Respondent was served with a preliminary notice on or before March 15, 2011.
The preliminary notice describes the particular kinds of services to be reduced pursuant to the
Resolution, as set forth in factual finding number 3, ante. The preliminary notice also notifies
each employee of his or her right to request a hearing to determine if there is cause for not
reemploying him or her for the ensuing school year, and that a written request for a hearing
must be filed on or before March 18, 2011. A total of 63 certificated employees, including
Respondents, filed timely their requests for a hearing in this matter.

5.

On or about March 17, 2011, the District filed and served the Accusation and

other required documents on 63 employees who had timely filed a request for hearing.
Respondents, with the exception of Brian Zurla, thereafter timely filed notices of defense,
seeking a determination of whether cause exists for not reemploying them for the 2011-2012
school year.

The parties stipulated that all prehearing jurisdictional requirements were met.

The services set forth in factual finding number 3 are particular kinds of services

which may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.

8.

The Board took action to reduce or discontinue the services set forth in factual
finding number 3 because of the uncertainty surrounding future State funding and because the
District has experienced declining enrollment. The decision to reduce these services is neither
arbitrary nor capricious but is rather a proper exercise of the District's discretion.

6.

7.

3

9.

The reduction of services set forth in factual finding number 3 is related to the
welfare of the District and its pupils, and it has become necessary to decrease the number of
certificated employees as determined by the Governing Board.

10.

The District maintains a seniority list which contains employees' seniority dates

(first date of paid service), credential information, and current assignments.

11.

The Resolution includes criteria for breaking seniority ties for employees who

share the same first date of paid service in a probationary position (seniority date). The order of
termination is determined by reference to the tiebreaker criteria and points that are to be
assigned for, among other things, bilingual credentials, English learner certifications, total
number of credentials, earning a master’s degree, obtaining national board certification, serving
in specific positions, and total number of services provided. The more points awarded to a
teacher, the higher his or her seniority within the group of teachers who share the same
seniority date. In the event of a tie after reference to all listed criteria, a lottery would be held.
Respondents raised only one issue regarding the application of the tie-breaking criteria: the
Resolution provides for assigning one point for earning a master’s degree, but makes no
provision for awarding a point for earning a doctorate degree. Nevertheless, the District
assigned one point to Respondent Kyle Blotzer (Blotzer), a physical education teacher, for
earning her doctorate degree. This increased Blotzer’s total points and allowed her to avoid a
tie-breaking lottery with other employees who shared Blotzer’s seniority date, August 18, 2003,
and total points; however, neither Blotzer nor the next most senior person teaching physical
education, Daniel Johns, are subject to layoff in this proceeding because they both are able to
bump into the positions of more junior employees. The issue of Blotzer’s total points,
therefore, does not affect the order of layoff, and will not be decided herein.

12.

The District used the seniority list to determine the least senior certificated

employees currently assigned in the particular kinds of services that it was seeking to reduce in
this layoff proceeding. The District then determined how many certificated employees assigned
in the particular kinds of services are retiring or resigning; whether the least senior certificated
employees in these particular kinds of services hold other credentials, can perform in other
service areas, and are entitled to bump other more junior certificated employees; whether
certain certificated employees should be skipped and retained; how many certificated
employees are bumping into each service area; and how many certificated employees in each
service area must be reassigned or laid off.

13.

According to the District’s seniority list, Respondent Kristen Tedei (Tedei) is
currently teaching five periods of algebra at Arcadia High School and has a seniority date of
August 24, 2009. The District has identified Tedei as a probationary 2 employee, and she is
subject to layoff due to the reduction of 3.00 FTE’s of mathematics instruction in grades 9-12.
Tedei was a student intern when she served as a temporary teacher in the District in the 2008-
2009 school year. She returned to teach at the District in the 2009-2010 school year, once again

4

under a temporary contract. She was hired as a probationary employee in the 2010-2011 school
year. The District then reclassified her as a probationary employee for her service in the 2009-
2010 school year, as required under section 44918, because she became a probationary
employee in 2010-2011. Tedei maintains that, because she was an intern in the 2008-2009
school year, she should be classified as a probationary employee during this period under
section 44885.5; however, section 44885.5 requires the District to classify as probationary, any
person employed as a “district intern.” Tedei was a university intern in 2008-2009, e.g., an
intern who is still matriculating and earning university credits for an internship. She was not a
district intern. The District assigned the correct seniority date for Tedei.

13.

Julia Kennedy (Kennedy) has been teaching adapted physical education (APE)

to students with disabilities since 1979, originally with the Los Angeles County Office of
Education, and later with the District. She possesses two clear single subject credentials, as an
APE Specialist and physical education teacher. Kennedy has a seniority date with the District
of August 18, 2003, and is slated for a 0.50 FTE layoff in this proceeding due to being bumped
by a more senior certificated employee who is competent to teach APE. Kennedy maintains
that the District should have “skipped” her under the Resolution’s skipping criteria, which
states that the Board will seek to exempt from the order of layoff certificated personnel “who
possess a credential authorizing service in special education, who are presently assigned within
the scope of that credential, and who will be assigned within the scope of that credential for the
2011-2012 school year.” Although the students that Kennedy teaches have special needs,
Kennedy does not possess a credential that specifically authorizes her to perform special
education services. Assuming for purposes of argument that Kennedy’s credential authorizes
her to perform special education services, a point that the District does not concede, Kennedy
failed to demonstrate all criteria the District must establish to “skip” her under section 44955,
subdivision (d)(1).

13b. Under section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), junior teachers may be given retention

priority over senior teachers if the District can demonstrate a specific need for personnel to
teach a specific course or course of study, and the junior teachers possess special skills or
capabilities to teach that course of course of study, which their more senior counterparts lack.
(Santa Clara Federation of Teachers, Local 2393 v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified
School District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831, 842-843.) The District intends to retain Blotzer, a
more senior teacher than Kennedy. Blotzer possesses a credential to teach APE. Blotzer’s
current assignment is a position as a middle school physical education instructor that is being
discontinued under the Resolution. The District asserts that Blotzer is qualified to teach the
APE courses that Peter Taynton, a junior teacher currently teaching a 0.50 FTE assignment of
APE, and 50 percent of Kennedy’s assignment. Kennedy thereby will retain 50 percent of her
assignment. These facts demonstrate that the District cannot skip Kennedy, because one
necessary criterion for skipping is missing, i.e., there is a senior person who is qualified to teach
the APE classes that Kennedy teaches.

5

14.

Nicholas Lemas currently teaches four periods of physical education and one

period of athletics as the head baseball coach at Arcadia High School. He possesses clear
single subject credentials in physical education and health sciences. He has a master’s degree.
His seniority date is August 21, 2006, and he is identified as #396 on the seniority list.
Although the District intends to discontinue 2.20 FTE’s of 9-12 physical education and health,
Lemas, although the District determined that it will be releasing temporary employees serving
in those positions and that it is not necessary to layoff Lemas to accomplish the reduction of
2.20 FTE’s; however, the District has determined that employees senior to Lemas who are
subject to layoff are credentialed and qualified to bump into Lemas’s position. Liza Tedford
(Tedford) has a seniority date of September 7, 1993. She is credentialed to teach physical
education, with a special authorization in dance. She teaches four periods of dance at the high
school, and is taking a 0.20 FTE leave of absence, which she has a right to return to. The
Resolution prorposes reducing performing arts/dance teaching services by 0.20 FTE’s, leaving
0.60 FTE’s of dance. This means Tedford will need to bump one or more junior employees
corresponding to 0.40 FTE to retain a full position. The District determined that Tedford will
be able to bump Blotzer for 0.20 FTE and Lemas for 0.20 FTE, leaving Lemas with a 0.80 FTE
position. Daniel Johns (Johns) has a seniority date of August 18, 2003. He is credentialed to
teach physical education and currently teaches seventh and eighth grade physical education
classes. Johns is subject to a 1.00 FTE layoff based on the reduction called for by the
Resolution of 2.60 FTE’s in 6-8 physical education services. The District determined that
Johns can bump into the remaining 0.80 FTE of Lemas’s position. Lemas challenges this
bumping analysis, maintaing that he teaches health courses in the fall (but not currently during
spring of 2011), and that neither Tedford nor Johns is credentialed or competent to teach health.
Lemas’s argument fails on two counts. First, the District may rely on Lemas’s current
assignment, which does not include a health course, to determine whether other employees
subject to layoff who have more seniority than Lemas are credentialed and competent to teach
Lemas’s position. Second, Lemas has not established facts demonstrating that the District will
not be able to offer health courses unless Lemas is retained.

15.

The District in its seniority list identifies Respondents Jane Ellis, Lindsay

Hamilton, Jessica Hung, Emily Kalmbach, and Adriana Perez as performing services pursuant
to temporary contracts, and the District has released these Respondents from their employment
effective at the conclusion of the 2010-2011 school year. The District served “precautionary”
preliminary notices “out of an abundance of caution.” It further maintains these employees do
not possess rights to participate in this layoff proceeding. In this proceeding, none of these
Respondents has contested the District’s classification of them as temporary certificated
employees. The District’s classification of these Respondents is presumed to be proper.

16.

Certain Respondents received a preliminary notice due to the possible outcomes
of the District's bumping and/or tiebreaking analyses. Based on the evidence presented, all of
the District’s tiebreaking and bumping analyses are upheld in this proceeding, and therefore,
preliminary notices as to the following Respondents may be rescinded: Valdoria Axtell,

6

Heather Brown-Hom, Irene Cheng, Melanie Coulter, Mylinh Crew, Michael Despard, Karen
Frontino, Kit Fung, Daniel Johns, David Jones, Leslie Klipstein, Cindi Lee, Raymond Mynster,
Nandita Pal, Jennifer Prince, Heather Sark, Caven Shen, Sarah Steinberg, Liza Tedford,
Jennifer Tran, John Tung, Donald Young, and Brian Zurla.

17.

Except as provided herein, no junior certificated employee is scheduled to be
retained to perform services which a more senior employee is certificated and competent to
render.
