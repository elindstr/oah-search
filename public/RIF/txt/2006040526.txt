On  February  27,  2006,  the  Board  of  Trustees  (Board)  of  the  District  issued 

Resolution  No.  419  proposing  to  reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  based  on 
budgetary  needs  of  the  District. 

5. 

On  February  27,  2006,  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955, 
the  Board  directed  that  notice  be  given  to  Respondents,  and  others,  that  their  services  will  not 
be  required  for  the  ensuing  school  year. 

6. 

Prior  to  March  15,  2006,  Respondents  were  provided  written  notice,  by 

personal  service  or  registered  mail,  of  the  recommendation  that  they  receive  notice  pursuant 
to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the 
ensuing  school  year. 

7. 

Respondents  timely  requested  in  writing  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is 

cause  to  not  re-employ  them  next  school  year.  Each  Respondent  was  thereafter  served  with 

an  Accusation.   

8. 

The  following  Respondents  timely  filed  a  Notice  of  Defense:  Rachel  Coleman, 

Gail  Crabtree,  Kelly  Curd,  Alison  East,  Angela  Kim,  Brooke  Padilla,  Jennifer  Paine,  Julie 
Roth  and  Christina  Tarbell.  The  parties  agreed  that  although  Respondent  Susan  Dember 
filed  her  Notice  of  Defense  late,  she  could  also  participate  in  the  hearing  and  a  disposition  of 
the  Accusation  against  her  be  made.

attrition. 

After  adoption  of  Resolution  No.  419,  the  Board  considered  all  known  assured 

. 

10. 

The  hearing  of  this  matter  was  initially  scheduled  for  April  28,  2006.  By 

mutual  agreement  of  the  parties,  the  hearing  was  continued  to  May  5,  2006.' 

The  District’s  Layoff Decision 

11. 

Board  Resolution  No.  419  specifically  provides  for  the  reduction  or 

elimination  of  the  following  particular  kinds  of  services: 

Full-Time  Equivalent  (FTE)  Positions 

  

Particular  Kinds  of  Service 

  

14  Full-Time  Teaching  Positions 

“1  Full  (2  Half-Time) 

Intermediate  Assistant  Principal  Position 

1 Half-Time  SELPA Director 

1  Speech  Consultant 

- 

Total  FTE  Reduction 

14.0  FTE 

1.0  FTE 

0.5  FTE 

4 

1.0  FTE 

16. 5 FTE 

12. 

Board  Resolution  No.  419  also  established  tie-breaking  criteria  to  determine 
the  relative  seniority  of  certificated  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  on  the  same 
date.  The  tie-breaking  criteria  were  used  in  this  matter  to  resolve  ties  in  seniority  amongst 
certificated  personnel.  The  tie-breaking  process  is  not  subject  to  dispute  in  this  matter. 

13. 

Subsequent  to  the  above-described  events,  the  District  became  aware  of  other 

factors  in  reasonably  assured  attrition,  including  the  release  and  resignation  of  other 
certificated  employees.  As  a  result,  only  11.0  FTE  positions  in  Full-Time  Classroom 
Teaching  need  to  be  reduced. 

  

'  Pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44949,  subdivision  (e),  and  Government  Code  section  11524,  the  deadlines 
prescribed  for  issuance  of  this  Decision  by  Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (c),  are  extended  by  the 
number  of  days  between  hearing  dates  caused  by  the  continuance  (7  calendar  days). 

 

14. 

The  reduction  or  elimination  of  the  11.0  FTE  positions  will  not  reduce  services 

below  mandated  levels. 

15. 

Cause  exists  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955 

to  reduce  and/or  eliminate  11.0  FTE  positions  in  Full-Time  Classroom  Teaching  for  the 
ensuing  school  year  because  of  the  financial  constraints  resulting  from  revenue  being 
insufficient  to  maintain  the  current  levels  of  programs,  and  necessary  program  changes  as  a 
result. 

16. 

The  District  maintains  a  Seniority  List  containing  employees’  seniority  dates, 

current  assignments  and  locations,  advanced  degrees,  credentials,  and  authorizations.  The 
information  on  the  Seniority  List  in  terms  of  seniority  is  accurate. 

17. 

The  District  used  the  Seniority  List  to  develop  a  proposed  layoff  list  of  the. 

least  senior  employees  currently  assigned  in  the  various  services  being  reduced.  In 
determining  who  would  be  subject  to  layoff  for  each  kind  of  particular  service  reduced,  the  | 
District  counted  the  number  of  reductions  not  covered  by  the  known  vacancies,  attrition,  and 
determined  the  impact  on  incumbent  staff  in  inverse  order  of  seniority. 

18. 

|  During  the  hearing,  the  parties  stipulated  that  final  notice  of  termination  shall 

be  sent  to  the  following  Respondents  and  others,  on  the  basis  of  least  seniority, 
corresponding  to  the  11.0  FTE  positions  that  are  being  reduced  and/or  eliminated:  Dember, 
Susan;  Gilson,  Sandra;  Giesler,  Dawn;  Brimmage,  Mary;  Cooke,  Kristen;  Berg,  Kirsten; 
Paine,  Jennifer;  East,  Alison;  Van  Sluis,  Amber;  Wolven,  Kristin;  and  Kim,  Angela. 

19. 

During  the  hearing,  the  parties  stipulated  that  the  Accusations  shall  be 

dismissed  as  to  these  Respondents:  Coleman,  Rachel;  Crabtree,  Gail;  Curd,  Kelly;  Espinosa, 
Martina;  Heimlich,  Cynthia;  Huff,  Kenneth;  Johnson,  Christine;  Miller,  Lori;  Nikaj,  Darrelle; 
Padilla,  Brooke;  Roth,  Julie;  Tarbell,  Christina,  Warner,  Alison;  and  Wrobel,  Melissa. 

20. 

|  The  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  above  particular  kinds  of 

services  was  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  but  was  a  proper  exercise  of  discretion. 

21. 

The  cause  for  reducing  and/or  eliminating  the  above-described  particular  kinds 

of  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  in  the  District  and  its  pupils. 

22. 

No  permanent  certificated  employee  with  less  seniority  will  be  retained  to 

render  a  service  that  the  Respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

All  notice  and  jurisdictional  requirements  set  forth  in  Education  Code  sections 

44944  and  44945  were  met.  (Factual  Findings  1-10.)

2. 

The  11.0  FTE  positions  in  question  are  particular  kinds  of  services  that  can  be 

reduced  or  discontinued  under  Education  Code  section  44955.  The  Board’s  decision  to 
reduce  or  discontinue  those  identified  services  was  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  and  was  a 
proper  exercise  of  its  discretion.  Services  will  not  be  reduced  below  mandated  levels.  Cause 
for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  those  particular  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of 
the  District’s  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949.  (Factual 
Findings  1-22.)

3. 

Cause  exists  to  reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  due 

to  the  reduction  and  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services.  (Factual  Findings  1-22.) 

4. 

No  junior  certificated  employee  is  scheduled  to  be  retained  to  perform  services 
that  a  more  senior  employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render.  (Factual  Findings  1-22.)
