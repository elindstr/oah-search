FACTUAL FINDINGS

Jurisdiction

1.

2.

3.

Harold J. Vollkommer, Ed.D., made and filed the accusation in his official

capacity as the District’s Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources.

Respondents are identified on Appendix A, attached hereto and by this

reference incorporated herein. All respondents are certificated employees of the District.

On March 6, 2012, the Board of Education of the San Bernardino City Unified

School District (Board) adopted a resolution which reduced particular kinds of services and
directed the superintendent to give appropriate notices to certificated employees whose
positions would be affected by the action. The resolution identified 251 FTEs to be reduced.

EL Authorization Skip

4.

In the resolution the Board “determined that due to a significant population of
English language learners with specialized educational needs, a specific and compelling need
exists to employ and retain certificated employees who have formal (not emergency)
authorization to teach English Learner (“EL”) students, as determined by the California
Commission on Teacher Credentialing, and the special training and experience that comes”
from having that authorization.

5.

The resolution specifically noted that the “failure to staff a classroom

containing one or more EL students with a certificated employee possessing an appropriate
EL authorization is ‘misassignment’ subject to sanction by the County Superintendent of
Schools.” The resolution referenced laws pertaining to EL students and noted that the
district’s needs and its students’ needs “should not and cannot be adequately served by
concentrating EL students in particular classrooms in such a manner as to lessen the need for
certificated employees with EL authorizations.” The Board further determined that “EL
authorizations are not required for school counselors, nurses, psychologists.”

6.

The resolution authorized the Board to deviate from the seniority list, i.e.
“skip,” if necessary pursuant to Education Code section 44955(d), those employees with
appropriate EL authorizations. Under Education Code section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), a
District may skip a junior teacher being retained for specified reasons. (Bledsoe v. Biggs
Unified School District (2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 127, 131.) Junior teachers may be given
retention priority over senior teachers only if the junior teachers possess superior skills or
capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack. (Santa Clara Federation of Teachers,
Local 2393, v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified School District (1981) 116
Cal.App.3d 831, 842-843.) A junior employee possessing special competence can be retained
over a senior employee lacking such competence. (Alexander v. Delano Joint Union High
School District (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 567.)

2

7.

Dr. Vollkommer testified that thirty-four percent of students in the District are

English language learners, making it necessary to offer them bilingual education. His
testimony established that the needs of the District required it to skip the certificated
employees with an EL authorization.

Bump Analysis

8.

The Board also implemented a bump analysis to determine which employees

could bump into a position being held by a junior employee. The resolution defined
“competency” pursuant to Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), for the purposes
of bumping as “(1) possession of a valid credential in the relevant subject matter area; (2) for
bumping a holder of a Single Subject credential in a departmentalized course in grades 7-12,
an equivalent Single Subject credential authorizing service in all grades 7-12; (3) ‘highly
qualified’ status under the No Child Left Behind Act in the area to be assigned (if required
by the position); and (4) an appropriate (not emergency) EL authorization (if required by the
position).”

Layoff Determinations

9.

Consistent with the Board’s Resolution, the District identified certificated
employees for layoff. The decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is
matter reserved to the district’s discretion and is not subject to second-guessing in this
proceeding. (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 167.) A school district’s decision to reduce a particular kind of service must not
be fraudulent, arbitrary or capricious. (San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.
App. 3d 627, 637.)

10.

The District considered attrition, resignations, retirements and requests for
transfer in determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices to be delivered to its
employees. No evidence was presented that any known positively assured attrition was not
considered. The District must issue final layoff notices before May 15, and when it does so
it will take into account any additional attrition that has occurred. After that, further attrition
will allow the District to rehire laid off employees. A question arose during the hearing
regarding the vacancies created by the attrition which has occurred since March 15, but the
district is not required to consider those vacancies for purposes of this hearing. (San Jose
Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal. App. 3d 627.)

11.

On or before March 15, 2012, the District timely served on Respondents a

written notice that the Superintendent had recommended that their services would be
terminated at the close of the current school year. The reasons for the recommendation were
set forth in these preliminary layoff notices.

12.

The District also issued precautionary layoff notices to ensure that it could

reduce its force in sufficient numbers as ordered by the Governing Board. There was nothing
improper in the District taking this precaution.

3

13.

An accusation was served on each respondent. No evidence was introduced

demonstrating that all prehearing jurisdictional requirements were not met.

Respondent Guy Krant’s EL Issue

14.

Krant challenged the District’s use of EL authorization as it applied to him.
Krant asserted that he has been unable to obtain that authorization because of his learning
disability. Krant and his wife both testified in this hearing and explained that his learning
disability affects his ability to process information requiring him to spend more time to learn
new information. Krant requested he not be laid off and that the District provide him with
more time to obtain his EL authorization.

Official Notice is taken of the Board’s 2010 and 2011 layoff decisions. In 2010 the

Board noted that in “January 2009 the District was informed by the California Department of
Education that it failed to meet ‘Adequate Yearly Progress’ and failed to meet the ‘100
percent Highly Qualified Teacher requirement for three consecutive years as mandated by
NCLB’” which resulted in the District being “placed into Level C of the Compliance,
Monitoring, Interventions, and Sanctions Program for the 2008-2009 school year.” Owing to
that non-compliance report and the fact that one-third of the District’s students were EL
students, the District “established the need for EL employees in the District.” Additionally,
the Board determined that “the district adopted a policy in 2007 advising teachers of the need
for EL training and its value to the district” and “even took the further step of sending letters
in late summer 2009 to all employees who were not EL certified advising them to get that
certification as it was most likely going to be used as a skipping criteria. The district even
went so far as to allow teachers right up until the day before the hearing to submit proof of
having obtained that certification, even going so far as to go to the local university the
Saturday before the hearing so that those employees who completed the training on that day
could submit proof at that location, without having to drive to the district’s offices to submit
proof. The evidence clearly established that the district went “above and beyond” to advise
employees of the importance of the EL certification and provided them with ample
opportunity to obtain it. The evidence did not establish that the district’s competency criteria
were arbitrary or capricious. (San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal. App. 3d
627, 637.)”

In 2011 the Board determined that Mr. Krant’s layoff notice should be rescinded
because he had “been diligent in his effort to comply with the requirement that he obtain EL
authorization” and would have obtained his authorization “had not been for his dyslexia.”
The Board concluded that because “of his dyslexia, he needs additional time to obtain it.”
Further, the Board held that “the district must make a reasonable accommodation in an
attempt to enable Mr. Krant to maintain his position as an art teacher. Mr. Krant has multiple
learning disabilities. They constitute an impairment that substantially limits one or more of
his major life activities. He requires much more time than most people require to complete
tasks involving memory, assimilating information, and responding to information. He has a
long record of this impairment.” Moreover, the Board determined that Mr. Krant was
“prepared to engage in an interactive and cooperative process with the district to determine

4

appropriate accommodations” and that the “law contemplates an interactive and cooperative
process to determine appropriate accommodations.”

The evidence introduced in this hearing regarding Mr. Krant’s attempts after last

year’s hearing to obtain his EL authorization demonstrated that essentially Mr. Krant waited
for the District to contact him and advise him of what accommodations it would provide. He
did little if anything to participate in the process yet was on clear notice that his job was at
risk. The testimony of Mr. Krant and his wife established that they now blamed his
assignment of an art history class as another reason that he did not have enough time to take
the exam, yet he never advised the District or his principal until just shortly before this year’s
layoff notices were served that he needed additional accommodations. Given the clear notice
from the District about the importance of an EL authorization and that it would likely be used
as a skipping criterion, no reasonable justification was offered by Mr. Krant why he sat back
and did almost nothing since May 2011 to obtain his EL authorization. Given that he was
well aware that his position was subject to layoff, the evidence established that he should
have taken an active role in the process and that the District did not “drop the ball” as Mr.
Krant asserted. Moreover, Mr. Krant’s testimony demonstrated that he passively sat back
and waited. He expected the District to actively pursue the matter with him and that was an
unreasonable expectation. Mr. Krant was afforded ample time to obtain his El authorization
and no reasonable explanation for his failure to do so was offered at this hearing.

Precautionary Layoff Issues

15.

The District issued precautionary layoff notices to ensure that it could reduce
its force in sufficient numbers as ordered by the Board. There was nothing improper in the
District taking this precaution. Given the notices that were withdrawn, some of the
employees who initially received a precautionary layoff notice are now being placed on the
district’s final layoff notice list while others had their notices rescinded.

Thomas Arrington’s Credential Issue

16.

Thomas Arrington holds a Single Subject Industrial Arts/Technology

credential which entitles him to teach a variety of industrial arts courses. He teaches a
certified automotive repair course at San Bernardino High School. He asserted that another
teacher with the same credential but more seniority is bumping him, but that that teacher is a
drafting instructor. Mr. Arrington asserted that one “does not take their car to a draftsman
for repairs” and that his experience in the industry has resulted in the course receiving
national certification which it will no longer have if he is released. While all that may be
true, the Legislature did not discriminate between the types of courses that one with an
Industrial Arts/Technology credential can teach and the District properly bumped the other
employee into Mr. Arrington’s position.

5

Precautionary Layoff Issues

17.

The District issued precautionary layoff notices to ensure that it could reduce
its force in sufficient numbers as ordered by the Board. There was nothing improper in the
District taking this precaution. Given the notices that were withdrawn, some of the
employees who initially received a precautionary layoff notice are now being placed on the
district’s final layoff notice list while others had their notices rescinded.

Final Layoff List

18.

The District is not retaining any employee with less seniority to perform a

service that any respondent is certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to sections 44949 and 44955,

and all notices and other requirements of those sections have been provided as required.

A district may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not,
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.)

3.

The decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is matter

reserved to the district’s discretion and is not subject to second-guessing in this proceeding.
(Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d
167.)

4.

Because of the reduction of particular kinds of services, cause exists pursuant
to Education Code section 44955 to give notice to respondents that their services will not be
required for the 2012-2013 school year. The cause relates solely to the financial welfare of
the schools and the pupils thereof within the meaning of Education Code section 44949. The
District has identified the certificated employees who are providing the particular kinds of
services that the Board directed be reduced or discontinued. It is recommended that the
Board give respondents notice before May 15, 2012, that their services will not be required
by the District for the school year 2012-13.

6

RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that the Board give notice to the respondents whose names are set
forth below that their employment will be terminated at the close of the current school year
and that their services will not be needed for the 2012-2013 school year.
