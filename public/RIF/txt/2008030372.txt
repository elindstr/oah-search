SUMMARY 

   

The  Governing  Board  of  the  San  Lorenzo  Unified  School  District  decided  to  reduce 

or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of  services  provided  by  certificated  employees  for  the 
2008/2009  school  year  for  budgetary  reasons.  The  decision  was  not  related  to  the 
competency  and  dedication  of  the  teachers  whose  services  were  proposed  to  be  reduced  or 
eliminated. 

District  staff  carried  out  the  Board’s  decision  by  using  a  selection  process  involving 

review  of  credentials  and  seniority.  The  selection  process  complied  with  Education  Code 
requirements. 

See  Appendix  A,  attached,  for  a  complete  list  of  Respondents.

5. 

By  letter  dated  March  14,  Dr.  Dennis  D.  Byas,  District  Superintendent,  gave 
written  notice  to  27  certificated  employees  that  he  had  recommended  to  the  Board  that  their 
services  would  not  be  required  by  the  District  for  the  2008/2009  school  year.  (District  staff 
had  calculated  that  the  balance  of  37.73  FTE  positions  could  be  reduced  by  attrition.)  Each 
notice  contained  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation. 

6. 

Each  of  the  Respondents  filed  timely  requests  for  hearing  to  determine  if  there 

is  cause  for  terminating  his  or  her  services  for  the  2008/2009  school  year.  Accordingly, 
accusations  were  filed  and  served.  Each  Respondent  filed  a  timely  notice  of  defense  and  this 
hearing  followed. 

7. 

No  jurisdictional  issues  were  raised.  The  Parties  stipulated  that  all  notices 

were  timely  and  properly  served. 

8. 

No  permanent  or  probationary  employee  with  less  seniority  is  being  retained 

to  render  a  service  for  which  any  Respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

The  District  established  jurisdiction  for  this  proceeding  as  to  all  Respondents. 
All  notices  and  other  requirements  of  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  have  been 
provided  or  satisfied. 

2. 

Cause  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44955  to  reduce  the  number 
of  certificated  employees  in  37.73  FTE  positions  due  to  the  reduction  and  discontinuation  of 
particular  kinds  of  services. 

3. 

The  proposed  reductions  and/or  discontinuation  of  services  are  related  to  the 

welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  as  required  by  Education  Code  section  44949, 
subdivision  (c)(3). 

ORDER 

Notice  may  be  given  to  Respondents  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the
