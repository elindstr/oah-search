10... 

The  District  maintains  a Seniority List  which contains  employes’  seniority 

dates  (the  first  date  of  paid  service  in  a  probationary  position),  current  assignments  and 
locations,  advanced  degrees,  credentials,  and  authorizations.  There  was  one  certificated 

.  employee  who  was  hired  by  the  District  after  respondents’  date  of hite,  however,  this 
_  employee  tendered  her  resignation  prior to  the  adoption  of  resolution  05-14: 

- 

_ 

ll. 

No junior  certificated  employee  is  being  retained  to  perform  services  which  a 

more  senior  employee  subject  to  layoff  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

12... 

The  Board  also  adopted  resolution  05-15,  which  sets  forth  tie  breaking  criteria  - 

for  certificated  employees  with  the  same  date  of  hire.  Both  Respondents  are excellent 
teachers  with  identical  credentialing and  similar  experience.  However,  Respondent  Damron 
has  received  more  Computer  Efficiency  Training  than  Respondent  Gibson..  Therefore,  in  the 
event  that  the  Board  decides  to  retain  only  one  of  the  respondents,  Respondent  Damron 
should  be  retained  based  on  the  training  she  has  received. 

‘LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS  _ 

1... 

All  notices and  other  requirements  of  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 

44955  were  met.  Therefore,  jurisdiction  was  established  for  this  proceeding.
