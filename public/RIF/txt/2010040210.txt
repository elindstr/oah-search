On  March  4,  2010,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  (Governing  Board) 
adopted Resolution No. 15-2009/2010, reducing or discontinuing the following services for the 
2010-2011 school year:

On March 8, 2010, Superintendent Foster notified the Governing Board that he 
had recommended that notice be provided to Respondents that their services will not be required 
for the 2010-2011 school year due to the reduction of particular kinds of services.  
 
 
On  or  about  March  10,  2010,  the  District  provided  notice  to  Respondents  that 
their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2010-2011  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of 
particular kinds of services.

11. 

The  Governing  Board  took  action  to  reduce  the  services  set  forth  in  factual 
 
finding number 3 because of the anticipated decline in State funding. The decision to reduce or 
discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious  but  is  rather  a 
proper exercise of the District’s discretion. 
 
 
12.  Despite the service cuts and reductions, the District plans to maintain services at 
State-mandated levels. Respondents objected to the enrollment projections on which the District 
relied,  and  asserted  that  the  layoffs  will  cause  services  to  fall  below  mandated  levels.  The 
District  established  that  its  calculations  were  reasonable,  and  the  evidence  presented  by 
Respondents,  which  consisted  of  enrollment  projections  derived  by  site  administrators,  is 
insufficient to establish that the services will actually fall below mandated levels. In any event, 
Superintendent  Foster  testified  that  if  its  projections  were  wrong  and  more  students  than 
anticipated enroll in District schools for the 2010-2011 school year, the District will employ the 
necessary certificated employees to ensure that teaching services remain above State-mandated 
levels.   
 
 
The reduction or discontinuance of services set forth in factual finding number 3, 
in the context of the anticipated decline in revenue, is related to the welfare of the District and its 
pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  as 
determined by the Governing Board.
