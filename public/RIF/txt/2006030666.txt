FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1, 

Dave  Urbanac,  Superintendent/Principal  of  the  Johnstonville  Elementary 

School  District  (District),  filed  the  Accusation  in  his  official  capacity. 

2. 

Lisa  Urquizu  (1.0  FTE’),  and  Meghan  Brownell  (1.0  FTE)  (respondents)  were 
at  all  times  mentioned  herein  and  now  are  permanent,  certificated  employees  of  the  District. 
They  each  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  District  on  August  21,  2002.  They  each  attained 
permanent  status  effective  July  1,  2004,  by  having  been  employed  for  two  complete, 
consecutive  school  years  (2002-2003  and  2003-2004),  in  which  the  District’s  average  daily 

  

'  Full-Time  Equivalent. 

 

  

attendance  (ADA)  was  250  or  more,  and  being  reelected  for  the  succeeding  school  year.” 
Respondents  are  the  District’s  least  senior  employees. 

3. 

On  February  15,  2006,  the  District’s  Board  of  Trustees  (Board)  adopted 

Resolution  No.  2005/2006-02-06-01  (Resolution)  in  which  the  Board  resolved  to  terminate 
the  services  of  2.0  FTE  certificated  employees,  based  upon  the  following  determination: 

(1)  The  following  particular  kinds  of  services  shall  be  reduced 
or  discontinued,  as  specified  below,  not  later  than  the  beginning 
of  the  following  school  year,  2006/2007: 

Services  to  be  Reduced 
Or  Discontinued 

Grade 
Level 

FTE  Reduced/ 
Discontinued 

  

Classroom  Teaching 

Grades  K-8  —  2.0  Reduction 

(2)  In  the  opinion  of  the  Board  it  is  necessary,  by  reason  of  the 
above  reduction  and  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of 
services,  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the 
District,  at  the  close  of  the  2005/2006  school  year. 

(3)  In  determining  that  it  is  necessary  to  reduce  or  discontinue 
particular  kinds  of  services  and  to  decrease  the  number  of 
certificated  employees  of  the  District,  the  Board  has  considered 
any  positively  assured  attrition  that  may  occur  before  the  start  of 
the  2006/2007  school  year. 

4. 

The  Resolution  further  stated  that,  “[a]s  between  employees  who  first  rendered 

paid  service  to  the  District  on  the  same  date,  the  order  of  termination  shall  be  determined 
solely  on  the  basis  of  needs  of  the  District  and  the  students  thereof,  as  provided  in  Education 
Code  section  44846.” 

5. 

The  services  identified  in  the  Resolution  are  particular  kinds  of  services  that 

could  be  reduced  or  discontinued  under  Education  Code  section  44955.  The  Board’s 
decisions  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  identified  services  were  neither  arbitrary  nor 
capricious,  and  were  a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion.  The  decisions  were  based  on  the 
welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils. 

6. 

On  February  17,  2006,  the  superintendent  gave  written  notice  to  respondents 

that  it  had  been  recommended  that  notice  be  given  them  that  their  services  would  not  be 
required  for  the  2006-2007  school  year  (Notice).  Respondents  filed  timely  requests  for 
hearing.  On  April  3,  2006,  the  superintendent  issued  the  Accusations  against  respondents  in 

  

*  Education  Code  section  44929.21,  subdivision  (b). 

     

this  matter.  Respondents  filed  timely  notices  of  defense.  The  parties  stipulated  that  all 
jurisdictional  requirements  of  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  have  been  met. 

7. 

On  June  16,  1992,  the  Board  adopted  Board  Policy  #4135,  Certificated 
Services—Order  of  Termination  and  Reemployment  (tiebreaker  criteria),  in  order  to 
establish  the  “the  specific  criteria  to  be  used  in  determining  the  order  of  termination  and 
reemployment  of  certificated  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  in  a  probationary 
position  on  the  same  date....”  The  tiebreaker  criteria  stated  that  the  order  of  termination 
  ‘would  be  determined  based  on  the  following  criteria,  in  the  order  listed: 

_

1. 

California  credentials  held,  in  the  following  order: 

a. 

b. 

General  Elementary,  Standard  Elementary  with  a

Multiple  Subject 
General  Secondary,  or  Standard  Secondary,

subjects 
Single  subject  credential 

c. 
d.  Emergency  credential 
e. 

Other 

Teacher  evaluations  and  formal  observation  reports 
based  on  services  within  Johnstonville  Elementary 
School  District,  which  are  on  file. 

Number  of  years  of  teaching  experience  acceptable  for  _ 
initial  salary  schedule  placement  or  salary  schedule 
advancement  in  the  Johnstonville  Elementary  School 
District. 

Number  of  units  acceptable  for  initial  salary  schedule 
placement  or  salary  schedule  advancement  in  the 
Johnstonville  Elementary  School  District. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

8. 

The  certificated  salary  schedule  for  District  employees  specifies  different 
salary  levels  for  teachers  based  upon  the  number  of  units  obtained  beyond  a  bachelor’s 
degree  (BA).  The  levels,  also  referred  to  as  “columns,”  are  “BA  +  15”  (Column  I),  “BA  + 
30”  (Column  II),  “BA  +  45”  (Column  IID),  and  “BA  +  60”  (Column  IV). 

9. 

On  October  15,  1984,’  the  District  adopted  Article  XVII,  PROFESSIONAL 

GROWTH  PROCEDURES,  as  part  of  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  between  the 
Johnstonville  Elementary  School  District  and  the  Johnstonville  Teachers’  Association, 

3  Amended  October  22,  1987,  January  26,  1996,  and  June  20,  2000.   

  

  

CTA/NEA  (CBA).  Section  18.1  of  the  CBA,  Professional  Growth  Procedures,  addresses  the 
circumstances  under  which  courses  completed  by  teachers  can  be  submitted  for 
reimbursement  in  a  given  calendar  year.  Section  18.1.1  states: 

There  shall  be  a  limit  of  12  semester  units,  which  shall  have 
prior  Superintendent/Board  approval,  and  which  may  be 
acceptable  for  reimbursement  in  any  one  calendar  year. 

a. 

b. 

C. 

The  definition  of  a  calendar  year  for  this  purpose  shall  be 
July  1  to  June  30  of  the  following  year. 
There  shall  be  a  limit  of  9  units  which  may  be  completed 
in  any  college  semester. 
All  units  must  be  submitted  on  official  transcripts  or 
other  official  verification  to  the  Superintendent  for 
tentative  approval  and/or  reimbursement  prior  to 
September  21  of  each  calendar  year.  (emphasis 
supplied) 

10. 

Section  18.1.2  of  the  CBA  sets  forth  the  criteria  for  acceptance  of  credits  for 

reimbursement.  Subsection  18.1.2.f.  states  that,  “[f]or  an  employee  to  advance  on  the 
salary  columns,  the  appropriate  units  indicated  on  the  salary  schedule  must  be  completed 
with  a  passing  grade  from  an  accredited  university/college.”  (emphasis  supplied) 

11. 

According  to  the  testimony  of  Mr.  Urbanac,  the  District  has  not  insisted  on 

strict  compliance  with  the  September  21  deadline  to  determine  salary  schedule  placement  at 
the  start  of  the  school  year.  If  a  teacher  informed  the  District  that  he  or  she  had  additional 
units,  but  did  not  submit  documentary  evidence  by  September  21,  the  District’s  practice  was 
to  move  the  teacher  up  on  the  salary  schedule,  with  the  understanding  that  the  transcript  was 
“on  the  way.”  According  to  Mr.  Urbanac,  the  paperwork  for  salary  adjustments  was 
typically  submitted  by  mid-October. 

12. 

|  Respondents  were  each  initially  hired  in  2002  with  salary  placement  at 

Column  II,  Step  1,  based  on  units  beyond  their  BA  of  at  least  30,  but  less  than  45. 

13. 

Susan  Junette,  a  District  employee,  sent  an  e-mail  to  District  certificated 

_  employees,  dated  January  14,  2005,  which  stated: 

Dear  Staff, 

The  week  of  1-18-05,  I  will  be  working  on  a  seniority  list, 
including  credits  beyond  a  Bachlors  [sic]  degree.  If  you  would 
like  to  help  me  with  this  by  providing  me  with  a  current 
transcript,  I  would  certainly  appreciate  it. 

  

     

I  will  provide  everyone  with  a  copy  when  I  am  done.  If  you 
have  any  questions  regarding  the  list,  please  let  me  know 
immediately. 

Thank  you  for  your  help. 
Susie

On  January  28,  2005,  the  District  generated  a  Certificated  Seniority  List, 

which  showed  respondent  Urquizu  as  having  greater  seniority  that  respondent  Brownell,  as

Ms.  Junette  prepared  another  certificated  seniority  list,  dated  March  4,  2005, 

which  requested  corrections  by  March  5,  2005.  The  information  for  respondents  was 
unchanged  on  the  March  4,  2005  seniority  list. 

17. 

In  anticipation  of  certificated  employee  layoffs  in  the  spring  of  2005,  the 

District  prepared  an  Order  of  Employment  Analysis  for  each  respondent,  in  order  to  apply 
the  District’s  tiebreaker  criteria.  In  the  Order  of  Employment  Analysis  for  respondent 
Urquizu,  dated  March  3,  2005,  the  District  noted  respondent  Urquizu’s  salary  schedule 

  

  

placement,  as  of  August  19,  2004,  at  “Class  IV,  step  III  (3  years).”*  The  District  further 
determined  that  respondent  Urquizu  had  68  units  beyond  BA  for  salary  schedule 
advancement.  The  District  prepared  a  similar  Order  of  Employment  Analysis  for  respondent 
Brownell,  dated  March  7,  2005,  in  which  it  noted  respondent  Brownell’s  salary  schedule 
placement,  as  of  September  3,  2004,  at  “Class  III,  Step  3,”°  with  57.5  units  beyond  BA. 

18. 

The  District  applied  the  tiebreaker  criteria  in  March  of  2005,  to  determine  the 

order  of  seniority  between  respondent  Urquizu  and  respondent  Brownell.  The  District 
determined  that  both  respondents  had  equivalent  credentials  (Criteria  1);  both  had  the  same 
number  of  excellent  teacher  evaluations  (Criteria  2);  and  both  had  the  same  number  of  years 
of  teaching  experience  acceptable  for  initial  salary  schedule  placement  (0)  or  salary  schedule 
In  applying  Criteria  4,  the  District  determined 
advancement  (3)  in  the  District  (Criteria  3). 
that  respondent  Urquizu  had  more  units  acceptable  for  salary  schedule  advancement  in  the 
District  (BA  +  68)  than  did  respondent  Brownell  (BA  +  57.5).  On  that  basis,  respondent 
Urquizu  was  determined  to  have  greater  seniority  than  respondent  Brownell. 

19. 

During  the  spring  of  2005,  respondent  Brownell  was  enrolled  in  courses  at 

Lassen  Community  College,  and  was  also  taking  additional  units  in  a  correspondence  course 
through  UCLA.  Respondent  Brownell  appeared  before  the  Board  in  March  of  2005,  in  an 
attempt  to  persuade  the  District  to  give  her  credit  for  work  in  progress,  which  she  anticipated 
completing  by  the  end  of  spring  2005.  She  was  told  she  needed  to  complete  the  courses  and 
have  transcripts  submitted  “by  the  date  of  the  Board  taking  action”  in  order  to  receive  credit 
for  courses  taken. 

20. 

Respondent  Brownell  completed  9  units  of  coursework  at  Lassen  Community 
College  in  the  spring  of  2005.  She  submitted  supporting  paperwork  to  the  District,  and  was 
categorized  at  Column  IV,  Step  4°  on  the  certificated  salary  schedule  for  the  2005-06  school 
year.  Respondent  Urquizu  likewise  received  placement  on  the  certificated  salary  schedule 
for  the  2005-06  school  year  at  Column  IV,  Step  4. 

21. 

Respondent  Brownell  completed  5,32  units  of  coursework  on  or  before  July 

15,  2005,  in  a  program  sponsored  by  UCLA.  The  District  did  not  have  a  transcript  verifying 
completion  of  this  course  as  of  January  2006. 

22. 

On  January  6,  2006,  the  District  generated  a  Certificated  Seniority  List,  which 

was  e-mailed  to  certificated  employees  of  the  District.  The  January  6,  2006,  seniority  list 
contained  the  following  notations  for  respondents: 

  

*  This  notation  refers  to  Column  IV,  step  3  (denoting  BA  +  60,  with  3  years  of  teaching  experience). 
*  This  notation  refers  to  Column  III,  step  3  (denoting  BA  +  45,  with  3  years  of  teaching  experience) 
°  Denoting  BA  +  60,  with  4  years  of  teaching  experience.

OnJanuary  9,  2006,’  the  District  issued  Draft  #2  of  the  Certificated  Seniority 
List.  The  document  states,  “[p]lease  advise  the  office  of  any  concerns  by  January  13,  2006. 
The  information  pertaining  to  respondent  is  identical  to  the  January  6,  2006,  Certificated 
Seniority  List,  except  that  the  January  9,  2006  Certificated  Seniority  List  indicated  that  both 
respondents  had  four  years  of  teaching  experience  with  the  District.  Both  the  January  6,  2006 
and  January  9,  2006  seniority  lists  showed  respondent  Urquizu  as  having  greater  seniority 
than  respondent  Brownell. 

| 

24. 

Immediately  after  receiving  the  January  6,  2006  Certificated  Seniority  List, 

respondent  Brownell  met  with  Mr.  Urbanac  concerning  the  additional  units  of  credit  she  had 
earned  by  completing  the  UCLA  correspondence  course.  Mr.  Urbanac  told  her  to  request 
and  official  transcript  and  submit  it  to  “Susie,”  i.e.,  Ms.  Junette.  Respondent  Brownell 
placed  a  “rush”  request  for  the  transcript,  and  submitted  it  to  the  District  on  or  before 
February  15,  2006. 

25. 

Based  upon  the  documentation  presented  by  respondent  Brownell,  the  District 

generated  a  Certificated  Seniority  List,  dated  February  15,  2006,  which  listed  respondent 
Brownell  as  having  greater  seniority  than  respondent  Urquizu,  as  follows:

7  Brroneously  dated  “January  9,  2005.” 

26. 

The  Board  met  on  February  15,  2006  to  adopt  the  Resolution  authorizing  the 
reduction  of  2.0  FTE  classroom  teaching  positions.  The  Resolution  further  “authorized  and 
directed  [the  Superintendent/Principal]  to  give  written  notice  of  recommendation  of  non- 
reemployment  no  later  than  March  15,  2006,  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 
44955,  to  the  Board  of  Trustees  and  to  all  employees  whose  positions  may  be  affected  by  this 
action.”  The  Notice  sent  by  Mr.  Urbanac  to  respondents  on  February  17,  2006,  included  a 
copy  of  the  Resolution,  as  well  as  a  copy  of  the  February  15,  2006,  Certificated  Seniority 
List,  showing  respondent  Brownell  as  having  greater  seniority  than  respondent  Urquizu. 

27. 

On  February  27,  2006,  respondent  Urquizu  sent  an  e-mail  message  to  Mr. 

Urbanac  that  stated: 

Dear  Mr.  Urbanac, 

Since  I  have  completed  the  units  for  the  AB466  training  and  I 
am  eligible  to  receive  8  units  for  attending  J  am  going  to  go 
ahead  and  get  those  units.  This  will  move  me  on  the  seniority 
list. 

Thanks,  Lisa 

Despite  her  assertion  in  the  February  27,  2006  e-mail,  respondent  Urquizu  did  not  pay 

for  the  additional  8  units,  and  did  not  provide  any  documentation  of  completion  of  these 
additional  units  to  the  District. 

28. 

After  Mr.  Urbanac  received  the  e-mail  from  respondent  Urquizu,  he  re- 

examined  Criteria  4  of  the  tiebreaker  criteria,  which  specified  consideration  of  the  “number 
of  units  acceptable  for  initial  salary  schedule  placement  or  salary  schedule  advancement  in 
the  Johnstonville  Elementary  School  District.”  He  also  reviewed  Section  18.1  of  the  CBA, 
which  addressed  the  acceptance  of  credits  for  reimbursement  completed  by  a  teacher  in  a 
calendar  year,  and  which  required  that,  “[a]ll  units  must  be  submitted  on  official  transcripts 
or  other  official  verification  to  the  Superintendent  for  tentative  approval  and/or 
reimbursement  prior  to  September  21  of  each  calendar  year.”  Mr.  Urbanac  thereafter 
recommended  to  the  Board  that  it  apply  the  September  21  deadline  for  submitting  credits  for 
employees  to  advance  on  the  salary  column  to  the  tiebreaker  criteria.  At  hearing,  Mr. 
Urbanac  testified  that  he  had  given  the  CBA  a  “more  liberal  interpretation”  in  the  past,  and 
wanted  to  take  a  “more  narrow  view”  in  recognition  of  the  fact  that  “more  issues  might  arise 
in  the  future.” 

29. 

On  March  24,  2006,  the  District  issued  Draft  #3  of  the  Certificated  Seniority 

List,  which  showed  respondent  Urquizu  as  having  greater  seniority  than  respondent 
Brownell:

After  respondent  Brownell  received  the  March  24,  2006  Certificated  Seniority 
List,  she  immediately  met  with  Mr.  Urbanac  to  discuss  why  she  was  not  given  credit  for  the 
5.32  additional  units  she  had  previously  documented.  Mr.  Urbanac  told  respondent  Brownell 
that  the  District  “was  no  longer  accepting  credits  after  September  21.” 

31. 

On  April  6,  2006,  three  days  after  the  Accusations  were  served  by  mail  on 

respondents,  the  Board  adopted  Resolution  No.  2005/2006-03-27-06  (Tiebreaker  . 
Resolution),  in  which  it  reiterated  the  tiebreaker  criteria  set  forth  in  Board  Policy  #4135,  and 
stated: 

WHEREAS,  the  Board  has  applied  the  above  criteria 

under  Board  Policy  #4135  to  determine  the  order  of  termination 
and  reemployment  of  certificated  employees  who  first  rendered 
paid  service  to  the  District  on  the  same  date,  and  has  determined 
the  order  of  termination  and  reemployment  under  those  criteria 
to  be  as  set  forth  in  attached  Appendix  A,  on  the  basis  of  the 
needs  of  the  District  and  the  students  thereof; 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  BE  IT  RESOLVED  by  the  Board 
of  Trustees  of  the  Johnstonville  Elementary  School  District  that 
as  between  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the 
District  on  the  same  date,  the  order  of  termination  and 
reemployment  on  the  basis  of  needs  of  the  District  and  the 
students  thereof  is  set  forth  in  attached  Appendix  A. 

Appendix  A  listed  respondent  Urquizu  as  having  greater  seniority  than  respondent

32.  |  Respondent  Brownell  relied  on  the  past  practice  of  the  District  in  accepting 

proof  of  additional  units  earned  after  September  21  for  purposes  of  determining  seniority  and 
application  of  the  tiebreaker  criteria.  She  stated  that  her  units  were  on  file  in  a  timely  manner 
under  the  past  practice  of  the  District,  but  now,  without  prior  notice  to  her,  the  District  has 
imposed  a  deadline  that  precludes  consideration  of  those  additional  units.  Because  she  did 
not  anticipate  the  change  in  the  District’s  interpretation  of  the  tiebreaker  criteria,  she  did  not 
provide  the  District  with  a  transcript  of  the  additional  units  earned  prior  to  September  21, 
2005;  she  could  have  done  so,  had  she  known  the  District  would  require  early  notification, 
since  the  coursework  was  completed  prior  to  July  2005. 

33. 

Respondent  Urquizu  asserted  her  belief  that  she  had  greater  seniority  than 
respondent  Brownell  because,  when  the  tiebreaker  criteria  were  applied  in  the  spring  of 
2005,  she  was  determined  to  have  greater  seniority.  She  was  surprised  to  receive  the 
February  15,  2006  Certificated  Seniority  List  showing  respondent  Brownell  to  have  greater 
seniority  based  on  additional  units  beyond  a  BA.  She  “did  not  realize  seniority  could  be 
fluid,”  and  she  noted  that  the  District’s  tiebreaker  criteria  created  a  situation  where 
employees  would  need  to  “compete”  with  one  another  by  taking  additional  classes  to  change 
their  seniority.  She  “looked  into”  obtaining  credit  for  additional  units  in  order  to  keep  her 
job.  Respondent  Urquizu  had  not  paid  for  professional  development  units  above  the  68  she 
had  previously  earned,  because  it  did  not  help  her  to  further  advance  on  the  District’s  salary 
scale. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

Applicable  Statutes  and  Case  Law  —  Layoffs 

1. 

Education  Code  section  44846  provides  in  relevant  part: 

The  following  general  provisions  shall  apply  regardless  of  date 
of  employment: 

10 

   
  

As  between  two  or  more  employees  who  first  rendered  paid 
"service  to  the  district  on  the  same  date,  and  who,  following  the 
termination  of  services,  have  a  statutory  preference  to 
reappointment  in  the  order  of  original  employment,  the 
governing  board  shall  determine  the  order  of  reemployment 
solely  on  the  basis  of  the  needs  of  the  district  and  the  students 
thereof.  Any  terminated  employee  subject  to  the  conditions  of 
this  section  shall,  upon  request,  be  furnished  in  writing,  no  later 
than  15  days  following  such  request,  the  reasons  and  basis  of  the 
needs  of  the  district  and  the  students  thereof  utilized  by  the 
governing  board  in  determining  which  employee  or  employees 
shall  be  reappointed.  This  requirement  that  the  governing  board 
provide,  on  request,  a  written  statement  of  reasons  for 
determining  the  order  of  reappointment  shall  not  be  interpreted 
to  give  affected  employees  any  legal  right  or  interest  that  would 
not  exist  without  such  a  requirement. 

Records  showing  date  of  employment,  whether  kept  by  the 
district  or  by  the  county,  shall  be  accessible,  on  demand,  to  any 
certificated  employee  of  the  district  or  to  his  designated 
representative. 

[.--[1 

The  order  of  employment  in  all  districts,  when  required,  shall  be 
_  determined  as  prescribed  by  Sections  44830  to  44855,  inclusive. 

The  governing  board  shall  have  power  and  it  shall  be  its  duty  to 
correct  any  errors  discovered  from  time  to  time  in  its  records 
showing  the  order  of  employment. 

Education  Code  section  44949  provides  in  relevant  part: 

(a)  No  later  than  March  15  and  before  an  employee  is  given  notice  by 
the  governing  board  that  his  or  her  services  will  not  be  required  for  the 
ensuing  year  for  the  reasons  specified  in  Section  44955,  the  governing 
board  and  the  employee  shall  be  given  written  notice  by  the 
superintendent  of  the  district  or  his  or  her  designee,  or  in  the  case  ofa 
district  which  has  no  superintendent  by  the  clerk  or  secretary  of  the 
governing  board,  that  it  has  been  recommended  that  the  notice  be  given 
to  the  employee,  and  stating  the  reasons  therefor. 

[.--(9] 

(b)  The  employee  may  request  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause 

1]

for  not  reemploying  him  or  her  for  the  ensuing  year. A  request  for  a 
hearing  shall  be  in  writing  and  shall  be  delivered  to  the  person  who  sent 
the  notice  pursuant  to  subdivision  (a),  on  or  before  a  date  specified  in 
that  subdivision,  which  shall  not  be  less  than  seven  days.  after  the  date 
on  which  the  notice  is  served  upon  the  employee.  If  an  employee  fails 
to  request  a  hearing  on  or  before  the  date  specified,  his  or  her  failure  to 
do  so  shall  constitute  his  or  her  waiver  of  his  or  her  right  to  a  hearing. 
The  notice  provided  for  in  subdivision  (a)  shall  advise  the  employee  of 
the  provisions  of  this  subdivision. 

(c)  In  the  event  a  hearing  is  requested  by  the  employee,  the  proceeding 
shall  be  conducted  and  a  decision  made  in  accordance  with  Chapter  5 
(commencing  with  Section  11500)  of  Part  1  of  Division  3  of  Title  2  of 
the  Government  Code  and  the  governing  board  shall  have  all  the  power 
granted  to  an  agency  therein,  except  that  all  of  the  following  shall 
apply: 

[{].--[9] 

(3)  The  hearing  shall  be  conducted  by  an  administrative  law  judge  who 
shall  prepare  a  proposed  decision,  containing  findings  of  fact  and  a 
determination  as  to  whether  the  charges  sustained  by  the  evidence  are 
related  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof.  The 
proposed  decision  shall  be  prepared  for  the  governing  board  and  shall 
contain  a  determination  as  to  the  sufficiency  of  the  cause  and  a 
recommendation  as  to  disposition.  However,  the  governing  board  shall 
make  the  final  determination  as  to  the  sufficiency  of  the  cause  and 
disposition.  None  of  the  findings,  recommendations,  or  determinations 
contained  in  the  proposed  decision  prepared  by  the  administrative  law 
judge  shall  be  binding  on  the  governing  board.  Nonsubstantive 
procedural  errors  committed  by  the  school  district  or  governing  board 
of  the  school  district  shall  not  constitute  cause  for  dismissing  the 
charges  unless  the  errors  are  prejudicial  errors.  Copies  of  the  proposed 
decision  shall  be  submitted  to  the  governing  board  and  to  the  employee 
on  or  before  May  7  of  the  year  in  which  the  proceeding  is  commenced. 
All  expenses  of  the  hearing,  including  the  cost  of  the  administrative  law 
judge,  shall  be  paid  by  the  governing  board  from  the  district  funds. 

The  board  may  adopt  from  time  to  time  such  rules  and  procedures  not 
inconsistent  with  provisions  of  this  section  as  may  be  necessary  to 
effectuate  this  section.

Education  Code  section  44955  provides  in  relevant  part: 

(a)  No  permanent  employee  shall  be  deprived  of  his  or  her  position  for 
causes  other  than  those  specified  in  Sections  44907  and  44923,  and 
Sections  44932  to  44947,  inclusive,  and  no  probationary  employee 
shall  be  deprived  of  his  or  her  position  for  cause  other  than  as  specified 
in  Sections  44948  to  44949,  inclusive. 

(b)  Whenever  in  any  school  year  the  average  daily  attendance  in  all  of 
the  schools  of a  district  for  the  first  six  months  in  which  school  is  in 
session  shall  have  declined  below  the  corresponding  period  of  either  of 
the  previous  two  school  years,  whenever  the  governing  board 
determines  that  attendance  in a  district  will  decline  in  the  following 
year  as  a  result  of  the  termination  of  an  interdistrict  tuition  agreement 
as  defined  in  Section  46304,  whenever  a  particular  kind  of  service  is  to 
be  reduced  or  discontinued  not  later  than  the  beginning  of  the  following 
school  year,  or  whenever  the  amendment  of  state  law  requires  the 
modification  of  curriculum,  and  when  in  the  opinion  of  the  governing 
board  of  the  district  it  shall  have  become  necessary  by  reason  of  any  of 
these  conditions  to  decrease  the  number  of  permanent  employees  in  the 
district,  the  governing  board  may  terminate  the  services  of  not  more 
than  a  corresponding  percentage  of  the  certificated  employees  of  the 
district,  permanent  as  well  as  probationary,  at  the  close  of  the  school 
year.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  statute,  the  services  of  no 
permanent  employee  may  be  terminated  under  the  provisions  of  this 
section  while  any  probationary  employee,  or  any  other  employee  with 
less  seniority,  is  retained  to  render  a  service  which  said  permanent 
employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

- 

[T].--[9] 

As  between  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  district  on 
the  same  date,  the  governing  board  shall  determine  the  order  of 
termination  solely  on  the  basis  of  needs  of  the  district  and  the  students 
thereof.  Upon  the  request  of  any  employee  whose  order  of  termination 
is  so  determined,  the  governing  board  shall  furnish  in  writing  no  later 
than  five  days  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  hearing  held  in 
accordance  with  Section  44949,  a  statement  of  the  specific  criteria  used 
in  determining  the  order  of  termination  and  the  application  of  the 
criteria  in  ranking  each  employee  relative  to  the  other  employees  in  the 
group.  This  requirement  that  the  governing  board  provide,  on  request, 
a  written  statement  of  reasons  for  determining  the  order  of  termination 
shall  not  be  interpreted  to  give  affected  employees  any  legal  right  or 
interest  that  would  not  exist  without  such  a  requirement. 

13 

   

  

(c)  Notice  of  such  termination  of  services  shall  be  given  before  the  15th 
of  May  in  the  manner  prescribed  in  Section  44949,  and  services  of  such 
employees  shall  be  terminated  in  the  inverse  of  the  order  in  which  they 
were  employed,  as  determined  by  the  board  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions  of  Sections  44844  and  44845.  In  the  event  that  a  permanent 
or  probationary  employee  is  not  given  the  notices  and  a  right  to  a 
hearing  as  provided  for  in  Section  44949,  he  or  she  shall  be  deemed 
reemployed  for  the  ensuing  school  year. 

(.--[9] 

Education  Code  section  44956,  subdivision  (a)(1),  provides: 

(a)  Any  permanent  employee  whose  services  have  been  terminated  as 
provided  in  Section  44955  shall  have  the  following  rights: 

(1)  For  the  period  of  39  months  from  the  date  of  such  termination,  any 
employee  who  in  the  meantime  has  not  attained  the  age  of  65  years 
shall  have  the  preferred  right  to  reappointment,  in  the  order  of  original 
employment  as  determined  by  the  board  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions  of  Sections  44831  to  44855,  inclusive,  if  the  number  of 
employees  is  increased  or  the  discontinued  service  is  reestablished, 
with  no  requirements  that  were  not  imposed  upon  other  employees  who 
continued  in  service;  provided,  that  no  probationary  or  other  employee 
with  less  seniority  shall  be  employed  to  render  a  service  which  said 
employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render.  However,  prior  to 
reappointing  any  employee  to  teach  a  subject  which  he  or  she  has  not 
previously  taught,  and  for  which  he  or  she  does  not  have  a  teaching 
credential  or  which  is  not  within  the  employee's  major  area  of 
postsecondary  study  or  the  equivalent  thereof,  the  governing  board 
shall  require  the  employee  to  pass  a  subject  matter  competency  test  in 
the  appropriate  subject. 

  

5. 

As  among  employees  who  first  rendered  service  on  the  same  date,  a  school 

board  must  determine  the  order  of  termination  of  employment  solely  on  the  basis  of  the 
needs  of  the  district  and  the  students.  Moreland  Teachers  Assn.  v.  Kurze  (1980)  109 
Cal.App.3d  648,  656;  Santa  Clara  Federation  of  Teachers  v.  Governing  Board  (1981)  116 
Cal.App.3d  831,  844-845. 

Application  of the  District’s  Tiebreaker  Criteria 

6. 

Respondents  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  District  on  the  same  date,  August 

21,  2002.  Under  the  District’s  tiebreaker  criteria,  respondents  remain  “tied”  when  Criteria  1 
through  3  are  applied,  in  that  they  have  equivalent  credentials  under  Criteria  1;  they  have 

14 

  

 

equally  laudatory  teacher  evaluations  and  formal  observation  reports  on  file  with  the  District; 
and  they  have  the  same  number  of  years  of  teaching  experience  acceptable  for  initial  salary 
placement  and  salary  advancement  in  the  District. 

7. 

Criteria  4  of  the  tiebreaker  criteria  states  that  the  order  of  termination  shall  be 

based  on,  “[the]  number  of  units  acceptable  for  initial  salary  schedule  placement  or  salary 
schedule  advancement  in  the  Johnstonville  Elementary  School  District.”  The  tiebreaker  criteria 
does  not  contain  a  cutoff  date  by  which  teachers  must  provide  information  to  the  District 
concerning  the  number  of  units  attained  beyond  a  BA. 

8. 

Article  XVIII  of  the  CBA,  Professional  Growth  Procedures,  establishes  a  cutoff 

date  of  September  21  of  each  calendar  year®  for  teachers  to  provide  transcripts  or  other 
documentation  of  units  “for  reimbursement,”  i.e.,  advancement  on  the  salary  columns,  for  that 
school  year.  Mr.  Urbanac  conceded  that  the  District  has  not  strictly  enforced  the  cutoff  date  in 
“Article  XVIII  in  allowing  teachers  to  receive  a  higher  salary  for  a  given  calendar  year,  so  long 
as  required  documentation  was  subsequently  provided.  The  District  has  never,  prior  to  March 
of  2006,  applied  the  September  21  cutoff  date  to  the  tiebreaker  criteria. 

On  the  contrary,  the  District’s  past  practice  of  allowing  teachers  to  provide  transcripts 
substantiating  additional  units  after  September  21  was  well  documented.  For  the  2004-2005 
school  year,  the  District  sent  out  an  e-mail  on  January  14,  2005,  soliciting  current  transcripts  for 
“credits  beyond  a  Bachlors  [sic]  degree”  in  order  to  prepare  a  seniority  list.  Respondent 
Brownell  was  told  that  she  needed  to  provide  transcripts  of  units  completed  by  the  date  the 
Board  took  action  in  order  to  receive  credit,  implying  that  she  would  receive  credit  for  the  units 
if  she  provided  documentation  before  the  Board  took  action.  Both  respondents  were  aware  of 
the  tiebreaker  criteria,  since  it  had  been  applied  to  them  in  the  previous  year  to  create  the 
seniority  list  for  the  2004-2005  school  year. 

9. 

As  of  September  21,  2005,  respondent  Urquizu  had  provided  to  the  District 

transcripts  or  other  documents  substantiating  68  units  beyond  her  BA,  while  respondent 
Brownell  had  provided  documentation  to  substantiate  66.66  units  beyond  her  BA. 

10. 

The  District  prepared  a  preliminary  Certificated  Seniority  List  in  January  2006, 
which  showed  respondent  Urquizu  as  having  greater  seniority  than  respondent  Brownell,  based 
upon  the  tiebreaker  criteria.  On  or  before  February  15,  2006,  after  further  information  was 
solicited  by  the  District,  respondent  Brownell  provided  transcripts  to  the  District  substantiating 
an  additional  5.32  units,  for  a  total  of  71.98  units  beyond  her  BA.  Respondent  Urquizu  did  not 
provide  documentation to  the  District  of  any  additional  units  beyond  the  68  on  file  with  the 
District.  Based  on  the  information  provided  by  respondent  Brownell,  the  District  prepared  a 
Certificated  Seniority  List  dated  February  15,  2006,  which  showed  respondent  Brownell  as 
having  greater  seniority  than  respondent  Urquizu,  after  application  of  Criteria  4  of  the  tiebreaker 
criteria.

®  Defined  as  July  1  to  June  30.

11. 

After  the  February  15,  2006,  Certificated  Seniority  List  was  distributed  to  the 

teachers,  respondent  Urquizu  informed  Mr.  Urbanac  that  she  was  eligible  to  receive  eight  units 
for  attending  “AB  466  training,”  and  was  “going  to  go  ahead  and  get  those  units,”  to  “move 
[her]  on  the  seniority  list.”  Mr.  Urbanac,  foreseeing  the  need  for  a  cutoff  date  for  teachers  to 
provide  documentation  of  additional  units  beyond  a  BA  for  purposes  of  the  tiebreaker  criteria, 
recommended  to  the  Board,  and  the  Board  adopted,  a  retroactive  cutoff  date  of  September  21, 
2005,  for  the  2005-2006  school  year.  The  Certificated  Seniority  List  adopted  by  the  Board  on 
April  6,  2006,  showed  respondent  Urquizu  as  having  greater  seniority  (BA  +  68)  than 
respondent  Brownell  (BA  +  66.66). 

12. 

|  Respondent  Brownell  contends  that  she  relied  on  the  past  practice  of  the  District, 
in  allowing  teachers  to  submit  transcripts  after  September  21to  substantiate  units  completed,  for 
purposes  of  determining  seniority  under  the  District’s  tiebreaker  criteria.  Respondent  Brownell 
earned  the  additional  5.32  units  on  or  before  July  15,  2005.  Had  she  known  the  District  would 
require  proof  of  completion  of  these  units  prior  to  September  21,  2005  for  them  to  be 
considered  in  application  of  the  tiebreaker  criteria,  she  could  have  taken  action  to  provide  that 
information  by  the  September  21  deadline. 

13. 

Respondent  Brownell’s  argument  impliedly  raised  the  issue  of  equitable 

estoppel.  This  doctrine  generally  requires  the  establishment  of  four  elements:  (1)  the  party 
being  estopped  must  be  apprised  of  the  facts;  (2)  the  party  must  intend  or  reasonably  believe 
that  their  conduct  will  be  acted  upon;  (3)  the  party  asserting  the  estoppel  must  be  ignorant  of  the 
true  state’of  facts;  and  (4)  the  party  asserting  the  estoppel  must  actually  rely  upon  the  other 
party's  conduct  to  their  detriment.  Equitable  estoppel  may  only  be  applied  against  a 
governmental  agency  "where  justice  and  right  require  it,"  and  it  will  not  be  applied  against  the 
government  where  it  would  effectively  nullify  a  rule  of  public  policy.  City  of Long  Beach  v. 
Mansell  (1970)  3  Cal.3d  462,  at  493;  Barrett  v.  Stanislaus  County  Employees  Retirement  Assn. 
(1987)  189  Cal.App.3d  1593,  1607;  Crumpler  v.  Board  of Administration,  PERS  (1973)  32 
Cal.App.3d  567,  582. 

14. 

In  this  case,  the  elements  of  equitable  estoppel  were  established,  namely  that  the 

District  knew  about  the  September  21  cutoff  date  in  the  CBA;  the  District  gave  incorrect 
information  to  respondent  Brownell,  in  that  it  gave  her  the  opportunity  to  provide 
documentation  of  additional  units  earned  prior  to  February  15,  2006;  respondent  Brownell  was 
unaware  of  the  true  facts,  namely  that  the  District  intended  to  retroactively  apply  the  September 
21  cutoff  date;  and  she  relied  on  the  District’s  action  to  her  detriment,  in  that  she  did  not  provide 
the  documentation,  which  otherwise  could  have  been  made  available,  prior  to  September  21, 
2005.  There  is  no  public  policy  that  would  be  nullified  if  respondent  Brownell  were  to  be 
awarded  greater  seniority  than  respondent  Urquizu  by  application  of  the  tiebreaker  criteria.  The 
District  could  have  imposed  a  deadline  after  February  15,  2006,  but  prior  to  the  date  of  hearing, 
for  respondents  to  provide  transcripts  to  substantiate  units  beyond  a  BA  for  purposes  of 
application  of  the  tiebreaker  criteria.  With  proper  notice  to  certificated  employees,  it  may 
henceforth  apply  the  September  21  cutoff  date  to  units  deemed  “acceptable”  for  consideration 
under  Criteria  4  of  the  tiebreaker  criteria.  “Justice  and  right”  require  the  application  of  estoppel

against  the  District,  and  the  District  is  estopped  from  applying a  retroactive  cutoff  date  of 
September  21,  2005,  for  the  2005-2006  school  year. 

15. 

Respondent  Brownell  has  71.98  units  acceptable  for  salary  schedule 

advancement  with  the  District,  whereas  respondent  Urquizu  has  68  units.  Therefore,  applying 
the  tiebreaker  criteria  to  respondents,  respondent  Brownell  is  entitled  to  greater  seniority  for  the 
2005-2006  school  year. 

Conclusion 

16. 

Jurisdiction  for  the subj  ect  proceeding exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code 

sections  44949  and  44955.  All  notices  and  other  jurisdictional  requirements  of  those  sections 
have  been  met. 

17. 

Cause  exists  for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  the  particular  kinds  of 

services  and  of  2.0  FTE  certificated  positions  at  the  end  of  the  2005-2006  school  year, 
pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  Therefore,  cause  exists  pursuant  to 
Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  to  give  notice  to  respondents  that  their  services 
will  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  school  year,  2006-2007. 

18. 

Cause  for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  services  relates  solely  to  the 

welfare  of  the  District’s  school(s)  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section 
44949, 

19.  | Noemployee  with  less  seniority  than  either  respondent  is  being  retained  to 

render  a  service  that  either  respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

ORDER 

1, 

Pursuant  to  Legal  Conclusion  15,  the  District  shall  amend  its  Certificated 

Seniority  List  to  reflect  that  respondent  Meghan  Brownell  has  71.98  units  beyond  BA,  and  is 
entitled  to  greater  seniority  than  respondent  Lisa  Urquizu,  who  has  68  units  beyond  BA. 

2. 

Notice  shall  be  given  to  respondents  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for 
the  2006-2007  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of 
services.  Notice  shall  be  given  to  respondents in  inverse  order  of  seniority.
