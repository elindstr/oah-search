Stehpanie  Tschetter,  Cynthia  Valenta,  Jason  Watts,  Michael  Weaver,  Glenn  Wheizel,  Albert 
Williams,  and  Cynthia  Williams.  (See  Exhibit  12.) 

Respondents  are  certificated  employees  of  the  District. 

‘Before  March  15,  2004,  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 

44955,  the  Superintendent  notified  the  Board  of  Education  of  the  District  of  the 
Superintendent's  recommendation  that  respondents  be  notified  their  services  will  not  be 
required  for  the  ensuing  school  year.  The  Superintendent's  notification  to  the  Board  of 
Education  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation. 

4. 

On  or  before  March  15,  2004,  each  respondent  was  given  written  notice  that 

the  Superintendent  had  recommended  that  notice  be  given  to  respondents,  pursuant  to 
Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955,  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the 
ensuing  year.  Each  written  notice  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation.  The  notices 
satisfied  the  requirements  of  sections  44949  and  44955.  San  Jose  Teachers  Association,  Inc. 
v.  Allen  (1983)  144  Cal.App.3d  627,  632;  Campbell  Elementary  Teachers  Association  V. 
Abbott  (1978)  76  Cal.App.3d  796,  803-04,  distinguishing  Karbach  v.  Board  of Education 
(1974)  39  Cal.App.3d  355,  360-63. 

5, 

Each  respondent  timely  requested  in  writing  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is 
cause  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  ensuing  school  year.  Accusations  were  timely  served 
on  respondents,  and  each  respondent  filed  a  timely  Notice  of  Defense.  All  pre-hearing 
jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met. 

6. 

The  Board  of  Education  of  the  District  took  action  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the 

following  services  for  the  2004-05  school  year:

The  services  set  forth  above  are  particular  kinds  of  services  which  may  be  reduced  or 
discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955.  California  Teachers 
Association  v.  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Goleta  Union  School  District  (1982)  132  Cal.App.3d 
32,  34-37  and  cases  cited  therein.  See  also  San  Jose  Teachers  Association  v.  Allen,  supra  at 
635-38,  in  which  the  court  specifically  rejected  the  reasoning  of  Burgess  v.  Board  of 
Education  (1974)  41  Cal.App.3d  571;  Zalac  v.  Governing  Board  (2002)  98  Cal.App.4th  838, 
353-54.  Furthermore,  these  services  may  be  reduced  because  of  budgetary  difficulties. 
Zalac  v.  Governing  Board,  supra,  and  cases  cited  therein.  The  decision  to  reduce  or 
discontinue  the  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious  but  rather  a  proper  exercise  of  the 
District's  discretion. 

7. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  to  any  respondent  is  retained  to  perform 
services  which  any  respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render  except  as  set  forth 
below. 

8. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  services  is  related  to  the  welfare  of  the 
District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated 
employees  of  the  District  as  determined  by  the  Board  of  Education. 

9. 

The  Board  considered  all  known  attrition,  resignations,  retirements  and 
requests  for  transfer  in  determining  the  actual  number  of  necessary  layoff  notices  to  be 
delivered  to  its  employees. 

10. 

The  District  created  five  Seniority  Lists:  tenured  teachers,  probationary  2 
teachers,  probationary  1  teachers,  interns,  and  emergency  pre-interns.  These  lists  contain 
employees’  hire  date  (first  date  of  paid  service  with  a  credential),  current  assignments  and 
locations,  majors,  credentials,  and  authorizations. 

The  District  used  the  Seniority  Lists  to  develop  a  proposed  layoff  and  "bumping"  list 
of  the  least  senior  employees  currently  assigned  in  the  various  services  being  reduced.  The 

3 

  

District  then  determined  whether  the  least  senior  employees  held  credentials  in  another  area 
and  were  entitled  to  "bump"  other  employees.  In  determining  who  would  be  laid  off  for  each 
kind  of  service  reduced  the  District  counted  the  number  of  reductions  not  covered  by  the 
known  vacancies,  and  determined  the  impact  on  incumbent  staff  in  inverse  order  of  seniority. 
The  District  then  checked  the  credentials  of  affected  individuals  and  whether  they  could 
“bump”  other  employees. 

11. 

Shelley  Bateman’s  first  date  of  paid  service  to  the  District  as  a  probationary 

employee  is  August  28,  2001.  She  is  a  tenured  teacher.  She  has  a  Ryan  single  subject  social 
science  credential  and  a  pupil  personnel  services  credential.  During  the  2003-04  school  year, 
she  worked  as  a  counselor  at  Chino  Hills  High  School.  Prior  to  that,  she  worked  as  an 
activities  director,  and  was  the  first  activities  director  of  Chino  Hills  High  School  when  it 
opened  in  2000.  She  worked  as  an  activities  director  and  counselor  during  the  2002-03 
school  year,  and  as  part  of  her  duties,  she  taught  two  periods  of  leadership  skills  and  help 
students  run  the  student  government.  She  resigned  her  position  as  activities  director  at  the 
request  of  the  school  principal.  The  District  proposed  to  lay  her  off  for  her  position  as  a  high 
school  counselor. 

.

 

Janet  Roberts  is  a  first  year  probationary  teacher  with  a  seniority  date  of  August  26, 
2003.  She  has  a  Ryan  single  subject  credential  in  physical  education  and  is  authorized  to 
teach  art.  During  the  2003-04  school  year,  she  was  assigned  to  serve  as  the  activities  director 
at  Chino  Hills  High  School. 

Michael  Rossi  is  the  District’s  associate  superintendent  for  human  resources.  He 
worked  in  this  position  from  1993  to  2000,  left  the  position,  and  returned  in  October  2003. 
He  is  responsible  for  hiring  and  termination  of  teachers,  registering  their  credentials  and 
establishing  seniority  dates,  and  so  forth.  He  testified  the  position  of  activities  director  was  a 
significant  one  with  a  great  number  of  responsibilities,  such  as  teaching  leadership  courses 
and  working  with  student  leaders. 

The  District  decided  not  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  position  and  further  decided  to 
retain  Roberts  because  she  had  performed  the  job  and  therefore  had  knowledge  and 
experience  in  the  position.  He  was  unaware  of  any  specific  credential  or  training  that  the  job 
required.  He  was  also  unaware  that  Bateman  had  any  experience  as  an  activities  director. 
 Ofthe  58  elementary  school  teachers  who  received  layoff  notices,  24  taught 
under  emergency,  pre-intern,  and  intern  credentials.  Some  of  the  teachers  with  university 
intern  credentials,  including  Rhonda  Martello,  Michael  Titus,  Dyan  Lindsay,  and Mia 
Caceres,  started  teaching  for  the  District  before  some  probationary  elementary  school 
teachers  who  were  not  laid  off.  Other  teachers  in  this  position  include  Patricia  Vasquez, 
Jeffrey  Jensen,  and  Melanye  Hallet.  The  intern  teachers  contend  they  should  not  be  laid  off 
if  there  are  less  senior  probationary  teachers  who  were  retained. 

12. 

Rossi  testified  the  District  drew  a  distinction  between  tenured  and  probationary 
teachers  on  the  one  hand,  and  interns,  pre-interns,  and  emergency  credentialed  teachers  on 
the  other  hand.  For  the  latter  group,  the  District  did  not  consider  the  date  of  hire,  i.e.,  the 

4 

 

date  they  began  teaching  for  the  District,  as  a  seniority  date  for  layoff  purposes  and  they  did 
not  have  the  status  of  a  probationary  employee.  He  reasoned  that  a  probationary  teacher  was 
rendering  service  toward  achievement  of  permanent  status  while  an  intern  was  not,  and  that 
under  the  Education  Code,  intern  service  counted  only  after  the  teacher  completed  the 
internship,  typically  two  years,  and  after  one  year  of  teaching  as  a  probationary  teacher. 

13. 

George  Karpontinis  is  a  pre-intern  and  teaches  math  at  Chino  High  School. 

He  was  originally  hired  on  August  29,  2000  under  an  emergency  permit,  and  became a  pre- 
intern  on  September  1,  2002.  The  District  proposes  to  lay  him  off  from  that  position. 

14. 

Elizabeth  Aguilar  is  a  first  year  probationary  teacher  with  a  seniority  date  of 

March  7,  2003.  She  has  a  Ryan  multiple  subject  credential  and  a  CLAD.  She  teaches 
kindergarten  at  Richard  Gird  Elementary  School  and  the  District  proposes  to  lay  her  off. 
Aguilar  testified  at  the  hearing  that  she  was  hired  under  an  emergency  credential  in 
September  1998  but  was  rejected  as  an  intern  in  2001.  She  remained  with  the  District  under 
the  emergency  credential  and  has  worked  for  the  District  for  six  years.  She  wants  to  have  all 
of  her  time  as  a  teacher  count  and  that  she  should  be  treated  as  a  probationary  employee. 

15. 

Patricia  Vasquez  was  hired  on  October  24,  2001  with  a  multiple  subject  intern 
credential  and  CLAD,  and  teaches  English  Language  Development  at  Townsend  Junior  High 
School.  She  testified  she  is  the  only  teacher  at  that  school  who  speaks  Spanish  and  believes 
she  is  a  valuable  asset  to  the  school.  She  testified  she  expects  to  receive  her  credential  next 
month  when  she  completes  one  more  class. 

16. 

The  District  proposes  to  retain  eight  teachers  who  taught  in  the  English 
Language  Development  Program:  Daniel  Robles,  Patricia  Rodriguez,  Lisa  Bader,  Galo 
Rivadeneira,  Kenneth  Garrett,  Laura  Araujo-Salinas,  Joe  Ledesma,  and  Adriana  Pascua. 
They  all  are  presently  assigned  to  the  ELD  program  at  the  high  school  level,  and  all  hold 
single  subject  and  CLAD  credentials.  There  are  other  teachers  in  the  District  who  also  have 
single  subject  and  CLAD  credentials  who  were  not  retained  solely  because  they  were  not 
presently  assigned  to  teach  in  the  ELD  program. 

The  Board  resolution  contains  nothing  with  respect  to  the  District’s  need  to  retain 
experienced  ELD  teachers.  The  District  has  no  rules  to  determine  what  qualifications  are 
necessary  to  teach  in  the  program.  According  to  Mr.  Rossi,  the  District  has  a  preference  for 
teachers  with  a  background  in  English  as  shown  by a  single  subject  in  English,  and  a  CLAD 
certification.  However,  of  the  ELD  teachers  listed  above  who  were  retained,  not  all  have 
single  subject  English  credentials,  nor  do  all  have  CLAD  certification. 

Mr.  Rossi  testified  it  was  a  challenge  for  the  District  to  staff  the  high  school  ELD 
classes  with  teachers  with  a  background  in  English.  But  other  than  saying  the  District  had  a 
need  for  teachers  to  teach  ELD,  the  District  offered  no  evidence  to  establish  there  was  need 

for  such  teachers.  The  District,  however,  did  not  lay  off  any  ELD  teachers.  

  

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

@ 

Jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 

44955.  All  notices  and  jurisdictional  requirements  contained  in  those  sections  were  satisfied. 

1. 

2. 

Education  Code  section  44955  provides  in  relevant  part: 

(a)  No  permanent  employee  shall  be  deprived  of his  or  her  position  for  causes  other 
than  those  specified  in  Sections  44907  and  44923,  and  Sections  44932  to  44947, 
inclusive,  and  no  probationary  employee  shall  be  deprived  of his  or  her  position  for 
cause  other  than  as  specified  in  Sections  44948  to  44949,  inclusive. 

. 

. 

(b)...  [W]henever  a  particular  kind  of service  is  to  be  reduced  or  discontinued  not 
.  and  when  in  the  opinion  of 
later  than  the  beginning  of  the following  school  year  . 
.  to  decrease  the 
the  governing  board  of the  district  it  shall  have  become  necessary . 
number  of permanent  employees  in  the  district,  the  governing  board  may  terminate 
the  services  of not  more  than  a  corresponding  percentage  of  the  certificated 
employees  of the  district,  permanent  as  well  as  probationary,  at  the  close  of  the 
school  year.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  statute,  the  services  of no  permanent 
employee  may  be  terminated  under  the  provisions  of this  section  while  any 
probationary  employee,  or  any  other  employee  with  less  seniority,  is  retained  to 
render  a  service  which  said  permanent  employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to 
render...  As  between  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  district  on  the 
same  date,  the  governing  board  shall  determine  the  order  of termination  solely  on  the 
basis  of needs  of the  district  and  the  students  thereof.  Upon  the  request  of any 
employee  whose  order  of termination  is  so  determined,  the  governing  board  shall 
furnish  in  writing  no  later  than  five  days  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  hearing 
held  in  accordance  with  Section  44949,  a  statement  of the  specific  criteria  used  in 
determining  the  order  of  termination  and  the  application  of  the  criteria  in  ranking 
each  employee  relative  to  the  other  employees  in  the  group.  Ti his  requirement  that  the 
governing  board  provide,  on  request,  a  written  statement  of  reasons  for  determining 
the  order  of termination  shall  not  be  interpreted  to  give  affected  employees  any  legal 
right  or  interest  that  would  not  exist  without  such  a  requirement. 

(c)  Notice  of such  termination  of services  shall  be  given  before  the  15th  of May  in  the 
manner  prescribed  in  Section  44949,  and  services  of such  employees  shall  be 
terminated  in  the  inverse  of the  order  in  which  they  were  employed,  as  determined  by 
the  board  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of Sections  44844  and  44845.  In  the 
event  that  a  permanent  or  probationary  employee  is  not  given  the  notices  and  a  right 
to  a  hearing  as  provided for  in  Section  44949,  he  or  she  shall  be  deemed  reemployed 
for  the  ensuing  school  year.  The  governing  board  shall  make  assignments  and 
reassignments  in  such  a  manner  that  employees  shall  be  retained  to  render  any 
service  which  their  seniority  and  qualifications  entitle  them  to  render. .

(d)  Notwithstanding  subdivision  (b),  a  school  district  may  deviate from  terminating  a 

certificated  employee  in  order  of seniority for  either  of the following  reasons:  

(1)  The  district  demonstrates  a  specific  need for  personnel  to  teach  a  specific  course 
or  course  of study,  or  to  provide  services  authorized  by  a  services  credential  with  a 
specialization  in  either  pupil  personnel  services  or  health  for  a  school  nurse,  and  that 
the  certificated  employee  has  special  training  and  experience  necessary  to  teach  that 
course  or  course  of study  or  to  provide  those  services,  which  others  with  more 
seniority  do  not  possess. 

(2)  For  purposes  of maintaining  or  achieving  compliance  with  constitutional 
requirements  related  to  equal  protection  of the  laws. 

To  put  it  more  succinctly,  a  senior  teacher  whose  position  is  discontinued  has  the 
right  to  transfer  to  a  continuing  position  which  he  or  she  is  certificated  and  competent  to  fill. 
In  doing  so,  the  senior  employee  may  displace  or  “bump”  a  junior  employee  who  is  filling 
that  position.  See  Lacy  v.  Richmond  Unified  School  District  (1975)  13  Cal.  3d  469.  Junior 
teachers  may  be  given  retention  priority  over  senior  teachers  if  the  junior  teachers  possess 
superior  skills  or  capabilities  which  their  more  senior  counterparts  lack.  See  Poppers  v. 
Tamalpais  Union  High  School  District  (1986)  184  Cal.App.3d  399;  see  also  Santa  Clara 
Federation  of  Teachers,  Local  2393  v.  Governing  Board  of Santa  Clara  Unified  School 
District  (1981)  116  Cal.App.3d  831. 

3. 

Respondent  Shelley  Bateman  established  she  was  senior  to  Janet  Roberts, 

possessed  the  credential  required  to  serve  as  the  activities  director  at  Chino  Hills  High 
School,  and  also  possessed  the  same  experience  and  skills  that  Janet  Roberts  had.  The 
District  therefore  failed  to  establish  under  section  44955(d)(1)  that  it  could  lay  off  Bateman 
while  retaining  Roberts. 

4. 

Section  44464  provides: 

An  internship  credential  shall  be  valid  only  as  long  as  the  holder  is  in  good  standing 
in  the  teacher  internship  program  of the  district  that  makes  the  request, 
notwithstanding  any  provision  of Section  44463,  and  the  rights  provided  by  Sections 
44948  and  44949  shall  not  be  afforded  to  interns. 

Section  44466  provides: 

An  intern  shall  not  acquire  tenure  while  serving  on  an  internship  credential. 
person  who,  after  completing  a  teaching  internship  program  authorized  pursuant  to 
this  article,  is  employed for  at  least  one  complete  school  year  in  a  position  requiring 
certification  qualifications  by  the  school  district  that  employed  the  person  as  an 
intern  during  the  immediately  preceding  school  year  and  is  reelected for  the  next 
succeeding  school  year  to  a  position  requiring  certification  qualifications  shall,  at  the 
commencement  of the  succeeding  school  year,  acquire  tenure. 

A 

 

In  contrast  to  a  university  intern,  a  school  district  intern  may  be  classified  as  a 

probationary  employee.  Welch  v.  Oakland  Unified  School  District  (2001)  91  Cal.  App.4™ 
1421. 

The  relevant  statutes  make  it  clear  a  teacher  working  under  an  intern  credential  is  to 

be  treated  differently  from  a  permanent  or  probationary  teacher  for  layoff  purposes,  and 
indeed,  need  not  be  accorded  the  rights  to  notice  and  a  hearing  provided  by  section  44949. 
By  reason  of  section  44466,  an  intern  may  receive  retroactive  credit  for  his  or  her  teaching  as 
an  intern  only  upon  the  satisfaction  of  certain  conditions:  completion  of  the  internship, 
employment  for  one  year  by  the  same  school  district  that  employed  the  teacher  as  an  intern, 
the  employment  must  be  in  a  position  requiring  certification  qualifications,  the  internship 
must  immediately  precede  the  employment,  and  after  completion  of  the  one  year  of 
employment,  the  District  reelects  the  teacher  for  the  next  succeeding  school  year  to  a 
position  requiring  certification  qualifications.  Until  all  those  conditions  are  met,  the  intern’s 
status  cannot  be  equated  with  that  of  a  permanent  or  probationary  teacher  employed  under  a 
clear  or  preliminary  credential.  Thus,  the  District  properly  determined  an  intern’s  date  of 
hire  did  not  constitute  “the  date  upon  which  [the  teacher]  first  rendered  paid  service  in  a 
probationary  position.”  (Ed.  Code  §  44845.)  It  therefore  follows  the  District  could  properly 
lay  off  any  teacher  working  under  an  intern  credential  before  any  permanent  or  probationary 
teacher,  regardless  of  when  the  intern  began  his  or  her  employment  with  the  District. 

5. 

Respondent  Elizabeth  Aguilar  and  the  District  disagree  as  to  when  a  teacher’s 

first  date  of  service  in  a  probationary  position  occurs  when  the  teacher  is  hired  at  a  time 
when  he  or  she  holds  an  emergency  or  pre-intern  credential,  and  subsequently  obtains  a  clear 
or  preliminary  credential.  The  District  argues  the  seniority  date  is  the  date  the  District  is 
notified  of  the  clear  or  the  preliminary  credential,  while  Aguilar  argues  the  seniority  date 
should  be  the  date  of  hire.  Respondent  relies  on  California  Teachers  Association  et  al.  v. 
Governing  Board  of the  Golden  Valley  Unified  School  District  (2002)  98  Cal.App.4"  369. 
(Golden  Valley)  and  argues  it  requires  employees  with  emergency  and  pre-intern  credentials 
must  be  treated  as  probationary  with  full  rights  under  sections  44949  and  44955.  In  Golden 
Valley,  the  court  held  a  teacher  working  under  an  emergency  permit  was  properly classified 
as  a  probationary  employee  and  was  entitled  to  the  written  notice  of  dismissal  and  the  right  to 
an  administrative  hearing  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  After  a 
lengthy  discussion  of  the  history  of  emergency  credentials,  the  Golden  Valley  court 
observed:  “[W]e  construe  section  44915  to  allow  a  teacher  serving  under  an  emergency 
permit  to  be  classified  as  a  probationary  employee.”  The  Court  stated  those  employees  are 
entitled  to  the  statutory  protections  governing  the  dismissal  of  a  probationary  employee.  Id. 
at  p.  383. 

There  are  substantial  differences  between  Golden  Valley  and  this  case.  In  Golden 

Valley,  the  issue  arose  following  the  teacher’s  termination  by  the  District  just  before  school 
was  to  start  for  the  ensuing  school  year,  and  the  basis  for  the  decision  not  to  reemploy  her  for 
the  ensuing  school  year  was  her  alleged  failure  to  complete  many  of  the  basic  requirements 
necessary  to  obtain  a  teaching  credential.  This  case  arises  in  the  context  of  an  economic 
layoff  under  sections  44949  and  44955  and  it  requires  consideration  not  only  of  respondents’ 
classification  and  seniority  dates,  but  how  their  seniority  dates  compare  to  teachers  with 

8

 

preliminary  and  clear  credentials.  Golden  Valley  did  not  consider  whether  a  teacher  working 
on  an  emergency  permit  who  has  been  classified  as  probationary  should  receive  comparable 
seniority  to  a  teacher  who  is  working  on  a  preliminary  or  clear  credential.  More  importantly, 
the  Golden  Valley  Unified  School  District  had  classified  the  teacher  as  a  probationary 
employee  pursuant  to  a  written  contract.  In  this  case,  there  is  no  contract  between 
respondents  and  the  District  classifying  them  as  probationary.  Under  these  circumstances, 
Golden  Valley  is  not  applicable  to  this  case. 

The  case  of  Summerfield  v.  Windsor  Unified  School  District  (2002)  95  Cal.App.4" 
1026  is  closer  to  this  case,  but  also  differs  from  it.  The  court  there  held  the  two  years  the 
teacher  spent  teaching  with  an  emergency  permit  could  not  be  counted  toward  the  time 
necessary  for  her  to  attain  permanent  status.  Therefore,  the  Court  held  the  teacher  could  be 
terminated  by  issuing  a  notice  of  non-reelection  under  section  44929.21  and  her  years  of 
emergency  permit  service  did  not  count  toward  tenure  pursuant  to  section  44911.  Id.  at 
1034.  Ina  footnote,  the  court  observed  that  although  the  District  had  originally  classified 
Summerfield  as  a  probationary  employee  though  she  was  working  under  an  emergency 
credential,  that  classification  was  improper.  Jd.  at  1035,  fn.  6.  This  case,  like  Golden  Valley, 
did  not  arise  in  a  context  that  required  creating  a  seniority  list  for  layoff  purposes. 

The  purpose  of  sections  44949  and  44955  is  to  ensure  credentialed  and  competent 
senior  employees  are  retained  over  more  junior  employees  and  permanent  employees  are 
retained  over  probationary  employees.  A  teacher  cannot  become  a  permanent  employee 
without  first  serving  a  mandatory  probationary  period.  Fleice  v.  Chualar  Union  Elementary 
School  Dist.  (1988)  206  Cal.App.3d  886,  893.  Nor,  according  to  Summerfield,  can  a  teacher 
working  under  an  emergency  permit,  lawfully  attain  the  two  years  required  for  permanent 
status.  There  is  no  statutory  authority  that  requires  a  school  district  to  classify  a  teacher 
working  under  an  emergency  permit  as  a  probationary  employee,  although,  under  Golden 
Valley,  a  school  district  may  do  so.  Once  a  teacher  becomes  credentialed,  there  is  no 
statutory  authority  enabling  the  teacher  to  retroactively  add  service  performed  while  working 
under  an  emergency  permit  as  there  is,  for  example,  with  a  temporary  or  substitute  teacher 
who  is  employed  the  following  year  as  a  probationary  employee.  (Ed.  Code  §§  44914, 
44917,  44918;  see  also  §§  44909,  44466.)  Based  on  the  foregoing,  it  logically  follows  that  a 
teacher  working  under  an  emergency  permit  cannot  acquire  seniority  over  a  credentialed 
teacher  simply  because  the  emergency-credentialed  teacher  has  worked  for  a  school  district 
longer  than  a  credentialed  teacher,  unless  the  school  district  chooses  to  classify  the 
emergency-credentialed  as  probationary  for  seniority  purposes.  Since  the  District  did  not 
classify  respondent  Aguilar  as  a  probationary  employee  while  she  worked  under  an 
emergency  credential,  her  date  of  first  paid  service  as  a  probationary  employee  must  be  the 
date  she  received  or  recorded  her  preliminary  or  clear  credential  with  the  District. 

The  foregoing  applies  to  respondent  Karpontinis  who  has  not  yet  received  a 
preliminary  or  clear  credential.  Thus,  for  respondents  Karpontinis  and  Aguilar,  their  date  of 
hire  is  relevant  only  as  it  compares  to  other  teachers  in  similar  circumstances. 

6. 

Respondents  contend  the  District  violated  section  44955(b)  by  failing  to  rank 

all  the  teachers  with  the  same  date  of  hire  using  the  Board’s  tie  breaking  criteria. 

9 

Respondents  argue  this  is  the  only  forum  which  would  allow  them  to  challenge  the 
application  of  the  criteria,  and  the  District’s  failure  to  do  that  deprived  them  of  an 
opportunity  to  correct  any  mistakes.  It  appears  respondents  were  more  concerned  with  the 
rehiring  process  than  this  layoff  process  because  they  recognize  the  District  did  apply  the  tie 
breaking  criteria  in  the  only  situation  where  it  was  required. 

The  Board  of  Education  enacted  Resolution  No.  2004-10  on  February  19,  2004  which 

sets  forth  the  tie  breaking  criteria  required  by  section  44955(b).  It  creates  a  point  system, 
with  varying  numbers  of  points  assigned  each  of  the  ten  criteria  listed.  Lower  point  totals 
indicate  a  low  seniority  date.  If  the  point  system  resulted  in  ties,  then  the  resolution  provided 
for  a  lottery  system. 

Respondents  and  the  District  stipulated  at  the  hearing  that  respondents  had  requested 

documents  and  materials  related  to  the  order  of  termination  between  teachers  sharing  the 
same  starting  date,  the  criteria  to  be  used,  and  the  application  of  the  criteria.  They  also 
stipulated  the  District  provided  the  criteria  and  an  analysis  showing  the  point  totals  and  five 
separate  situations.  Of  those  five,  however,  only  one  was  used  to  break a tie  that  resulted  in 
the  layoff  of  one  of  the  four  teachers  who  had  the  same  seniority  date. 

Respondents  focus  on  the  part  of  section  44955(b)  that  requires  the  District,  upon 

request,  to  provide  in  writing  “.  . 
order  of  termination  and  the  application  of  the  criteria  in  ranking  each  employee  relative  to 
the  other  employees  in  the  group.”  Respondents  interpret  this  to  mean  that  wherever  any  tie 
exists,  the  criteria  must  be  applied. 

.  a  statement  of  the  specific  criteria  used  in  determining  the 

The  tie  breaking  criteria  are  designed  to  determine  “the  order  of  termination.”  The 
ranking  of  each  employee  “relative  to  other  employees  in  the  group”  obviously  refers  to  the 
employees  to  be  terminated.  If  none  of  the  teachers  sharing  the  same  seniority  date  are  laid 
off,  there  is  certainly  no  requirement  to  rank  them.  Similarly,  if  all  the  teachers  with  the 
same  seniority  date  are  laid  off,  ranking  them  accomplishes  nothing.  A  ranking  when  all  of 
the  teachers  share  the  same  seniority  date  will  be  laid  off  is  simply  unnecessary  and  not 
required  by  the  statute. 

Section  44955  is  concerned  only  with  the  termination  of  teachers,  not  the  rehiring 
process.  Whether  respondents  can  or  cannot  challenge  the  District’s  later  decision  to  rank 
them  using  the  tie  breaking  criteria  in  a  rehiring  setting  is  irrelevant  to  the  District’s 
obligations  in  a  layoff  process,  and  does  not  create  an  obligation  to  determine  the  order  of 
termination  in  a  tie  breaking  setting  when  such  an  obligation  is  not  contained  in  the  statute. 

7. 

Respondents  object  to  the  way  the  District  identified  the  number  of  teachers  it 

would  lay  off,  and  wants  the  District  to  make  surgical  reductions  instead  of  using  an  axe. 
Respondents  point  out  the  District  used  a  backward  approach  to  arrive  at  its  final  decision. 

According  to  Dr.  Infusio,  the  District  faced  a  projected  budget  deficit  of  $16.5  million 
dollars  and  he  notified  the  Board  of  Education  of  that  in  a  March  4,  2000  memo.  The  Board 
chose  to  address  the  problem  by  reducing  or  eliminating  particular  kinds  of  services.  Section 

10

44955  allows  the  Board  to  do  that.  However,  the  statute  contains  no  rules  describing  how  a 
school  district  should  go  about  the  difficult  task  of  deciding  what  services  should  be  reduced 
and  the  extent  of  the  reduction,  and  therefore  deciding  the  number  of  employees  to  be 
terminated.  There  may  be  many  ways  for  a  governing  board  to  approach  that  task.  The 
method  the  Board  of  Education  chose  in  this  matter  is  a  legitimate  one.  Whether  it  is  the  best 
one,  or  the  one  respondents  would  have  wanted  chosen,  is  not  a  matter  within  the  scope  of 
section  44955,  and  thus  cannot  serve  as  a  basis  for  setting  aside  the  layoffs. 

8. 

The  District  chose  not  to  lay  off  any  teachers  in  the  high  school  ELD  program 

and  in  doing  so,  retained  teachers  who  were  junior  to  other,  noticed  teachers  in  the  District 
who  were  qualified  to  teach  ELD  classes  but  who  were  not  teaching  in  the  program.  In  order 
for  the  District  to  do  that,  it  must  satisfy  the  requirements  of  Alexander  v.  Board  of  Trustees 
of the  Delano  Joint  Union  High  School  District  (1983)  139  Cal.App.3d  567  and  section 
44955(d). 

In  Alexander,  the  Delano  School  District  decided  to  reduce  the  number  of  its  teachers 

and  at  the  same  time  selectively  retain  teachers  having  Spanish  speaking  skills.  Some 
teachers  who  were  discharged  were  more  senior  to  teachers  with  bilingual  skills  who  were 
retained.  The  court  held  the  district  failed  to  use  proper  criteria  in  terminating  the  more 
senior  teachers  because  it  failed  to  follow  the  seniority  system  contained  in  section  44955. 
The  court  reasoned  the  phrase  “the  needs  of  the  district  and  students”  did  not  apply  to 
determine  layoff  priority  where  teachers  had  different  seniority  dates,  and  therefore  whether 
senior  teachers  were  “certificated  and  competent”  was  the  critical  issue.  Alexander  was 
decided  before  section  44955(d)  was  added  in  1983. 

Section  44955(d)  requires  evidence  that  the  retained  junior  teachers  have  special 

training  and  experience  necessary  to  teach  in  the  protected  programs,  and  more  senior 
teachers  do  not  possess  that  special  training  and  experience.  Section  44955(b)  also  requires 
an  examination  of  the  qualifications  of  senior  teachers  to  determine  if  they  are  certificated 
and  competent  to  render  the  needed  services.  Section  44955  is  silent  as  to  what  is  required  to 
In  the  absence  of  legislation,  the  courts  have  repeatedly  held  school 
meet  these  criteria. 
districts  have  the  discretion  to  make  them.  In  Duax  v.  Kern  Community  College  District 
(1987)  196  Cal.  App.3d  555,  865-67,  the  court,  after  reviewing  the  cases  on  the  subject,  held 
“a  board’s  definition  of  competency  is  reasonable  when  it  considers  the  skills  and 
qualifications  of  the  teacher  threatened  with  layoff.” 

The  District  in  this  case  made  no  showing  to  satisfy  any  of  these  requirements.  Other 

than  demonstrating  there  is  an  ELD  program  at  the  high  school  level  and  it  was  difficult  to 
find  teachers  to  teach,  there  was  no  solid  testimony  to  show  what  the  District  was  looking  for 
in  the  teachers  it  chose  to  teach  this  subject. 

The  District’s  past  practice  of  using  teachers  with  either  single  subject  English 
credentials  and/or  CLAD  certifications  is  the  best  evidence  of  what  the  District  considered  to 
be  competence  to  teach  in  the  program.  Accordingly,  the  eight  most  senior  teachers  who  are 
qualified  to  teach  ELD  and  who  were  noticed  for  layoff  should  be  retained.  Those  teachers 

11   

are  Lida  Schneider,  Mel  Sims,  Melissa  Hamerla,  Kenny  Donovan,  Mary  Ragland,  Gregory 
Crow,  James  Baty,  and  Christian  Kleibacker. 

Linda  Tennies  was  also  retained  to  teach  in  the  ELD  program.  She  is  tenured  with  a 

seniority  date  of  August  28,  2001.  She  has  a  multiple  subject  credential  and  a  CLAD,  and 
teaches  at  Magnolia  Junior  High  School.  Respondents  have  listed  a  number  of  teachers  who 
they  claim  are  more  senior  to  her  and  certificated  and  competent  to  teach  ELD.  However,  a 
review  of  the  list  discloses  no  teacher  senior  to  her. 

9. 

Respondents  contend  the  District  improperly  skipped  Norma  Walters.  She 

was  hired  as  a  long-term  substitute  and  accordingly  did  not  appear  on  the  layoff  list  nor  does 
she  appear  on  the  seniority  list.  As  a  long  term  substitute,  she  is  subject  to  release  at  the  end 
of  the  school  year  and  there  is  no  evidence  that  she  was  offered  a  contract  for  the  2004-05 
school  year.  Thus,  there  is  no  reason  to  conclude  she  was  skipped. 

10. 

The  District  did  not  lay  off  Sarah  Gaudio,  a  pre-intern  hired  on  October  3, 

2003  and  teaching  in  an  Applied  Physical  Science  assignment.  The  Board  resolution  did  not 
reduce  Applied  Physical  Science.  There  are  other  teachers  who  are  qualified  to  teach  this 
subject  who  were  noticed  for  layoff.  The  most  senior  is  Terry  Roche,  and  she  should  be 
retained. 

11. 

Respondents  contend  Michael  Warren,  Michael  Weaver,  and  Rita  Gee  are 

junior  teachers  who  were  skipped,  and  name  a  number  of  senior  teachers  who  were  eligible 
for  the  same  assignment.  Warren,  Weaver,  and  Gee  are  listed  on  the  District’s  bump  analysis 
as  having  resigned,  and  the  District  used  their  positions  as  attrition  in  retaining  other 
teachers.  They  were  therefore  not  skipped. 

12. 

Respondents  contend  Susan  M.  Ouijano,  a  probationary  2  teacher  with  a 

seniority  date  of  August  27,  2002,  is  a  junior  teacher  who  was  skipped,  and  list  three  senior 
teachers  who  were  eligible  for  the  same  assignment.  However,  Joseph  Raya  is  an  intern  and 
he  was  hired  on  August  28,  2003,  after  Ouijano.  Claudette  Dugbartey-Smith  is  a 
probationary  1  teacher  but  her  seniority  date  is  October  23,  2003.  The  only  teacher  senior  to 
Ouijano  named  by  respondents  as  Terry  Roche,  but  she  will  be  retained  pursuant  to  Legal 
Conclusion  10. 

13. 

Respondents  contend  Brandi  Lopez,  Stephanie  Schuppert,  Shawna  Johnson, 

Jill  Goldbach,  Renee  Donohue,  Suzanne  Daniel,  Jenna  Au,  Jennifer  Reading,  Silvia 
Lagunnas,  Heidi  Lopez,  Cynthia  Williams,  Cynthia  Valenta,  Kristy  Toth,  Michael  Titus,  and 
Roger  Talley  are  junior  elementary  school  teachers  who  were  skipped,  and  they  list  21  senior 
teachers  who  were  eligible  for  the  same  assignment.  Titus,  however,  was  not  skipped;  he  is 
on  the  layoff  list.  Of  the  21,  two,  Christy  Martinez  and  Cynthia  Graham  were  not  noticed, 
served  accusations,  nor  appeared  as  respondents  in  this  proceeding. 

A  review  of  the  teachers  listed  by  respondents  as  “Senior  Employees  Eligible  for 

Same  Assignment”  reveals  six  of  them  are  interns  who  may  be  laid  off  before  probationary 
teachers.  (Legal  Conclusion  4.)  Of  the  remaining  13,  none  of  them  have  a  seniority  date 

12

earlier  than  the  most  junior  teacher  retained,  Brandi  Lopez.  Most  of  the  information 
respondents  provided  as  to  seniority  dates  was  wrong.  It  appears  respondents  used  the  dates 
listed  on  Exhibit  8,  but  that  is  not  the  official  seniority  list.  The  seniority  dates  set  forth  on 
Exhibit  6  are  the  official  dates.  Using  the  dates  from  that  list,  the  District  established  no 
elementary  school  teacher  senior  to  the  fifteen  teachers  listed  above  was  retained. 

14. 

Respondents  name  Jeffrey  Schuld  and  Derrick  Milgrim,  both  high  school 

English  teachers,  as  retained  junior  employees  who  are  junior  to  several  teachers  who  are 
eligible  for  the  same  assignment.  One  of  them  is  Terry  Roche,  who  will  be  retained.  (Legal 
Conclusions  10  and  12.)  Erica  Miller  has  the  same  date  of  hire,  but  the  District  used  its  tie- 
breaking  criteria  to  break  a  tie  involving  her,  Schuld,  Milgrim,  and  Browning.  (Exhibit  7,  p. 
4.)  Respondents  offer  no  reason  why  the  tie-breaking  decision  was  erroneous. 

Schuld  and  Milgrim  have  seniority  dates  of  August  27,  2002.  Both  have  single 
subject  credentials  with  English  majors  and  both  teach  high  school  English.  Liza  Miller  has 
a  seniority  date  of  June  30,  2002  and  has  a  single  subject  credential  with  majors  in  Intro. 
English  and  Social  Science.  She  teaches  high  school  World  Civilization  and  US  History. 
The  District  claims  Miller  holds  a  supplemental  authorization  in  English  and  is  not  qualified 
to  teach  in  the  assignments  held  by  Schuld  and  Milgrim. 

The  seniority  list  does  not  support  the  District’s  claim  that  Miller  holds  a 
supplemental  authorization  nor  does  it  support  respondents’  claim  that  she  hold  a  single 
subject  English  credential.  The  seniority  list  simply  indicates  she  holds  a  “Ryan  Single” 
credential,  and  lists  her  majors.  There  is  nothing  listed  under  “Supplementary 
Authorization”  but  under  “Authorized  Courses,”  a  CLAD  is  listed.  Schuld  and  Milgrim  also 
hold  “Ryan  Single”  credentials  with  majors  in  English. 

No  testimony  was  offered  at  the  hearing  as  to  what  a  Ryan  single  credential  with  a 

major  in  “Intro.  English”  authorizes  a  teacher  to  teach.  A  major  in  “Intro.  English”  suggests 
Miller  took  some  type  of  course  in  English.  Since  the  District  proposes  to  lay  her  off  and  to 
retain  Schuld  and  Milgrim,  it  should  have  to  demonstrate  Miller’s  single  subject  credential 
with  a  major  in  “Intro.  English”  means  she  is  not  certificated  and  competent  to  teach  high 
school  English.  The  District  did  not  present  such  evidence.  The  accusation  against  her 
should  therefore  be  dismissed  and  she  should  retain  her  position  as  an  employee  with  the 
District. 

Michael  Maley  has  the  same  seniority  date  as  Schuld  and  Milgrim  and  has  a  single 

subject  English  credential.  He  teaches  junior  high  school  English  and  is  qualified  to  teach  in 
In  its  brief,  the 
the  assignments  of  Schuld  and  Milgrim.  The  District  did  not  break  the  tie. 
District  alleges  that  applying  the  tie-breaking  criteria  would  result  in  a  determination  that 
Maley  is  junior  to  Schuld  and  senior  to  Milgrim.  The  District  properly  concedes  that  under 
the  circumstances,  regardless  of  how  the  tie  was  broken,  all  three  should  be  retained. 
Accordingly,  the  accusation  against  Maley  should  be  dismissed. 

15. 

|  Respondents  contend  that  when  it  is  determined  the  District  improperly 

retained  junior  teachers  by  skipping  more  senior  qualified  teachers,  the  District  must  retain 

13

all  the  teachers  so  skipped.  The  District  argues  the  number  of  senior  teachers  who  must  be 
retained  should  correspond  to  the  number  of junior  teachers  improperly  retained.  The 
District’s  position  is  the  more  persuasive  one. 

Section  44949(c)(3)  provides  in  part:  “Nonsubstantive  procedural  errors  committed 

by  the  school  district  or  governing  board  of  the  district  shall  not  constitute  cause  for 
dismissing  the  charges  unless  the  errors  are  prejudicial  errors.” 

Where  a  school  district  decides  to  retain  one  junior  teacher  and  lay  off  a  more  senior, 
and  it  is  later  determined  the  reasons  for  the  district’s  action  do  not  satisfy  the  requirements 
of  section  44955(d),  it  is  the  most  senior  teacher  who  is  prejudiced  by  the  district’s  action. 
Even  if  there  are  other  teachers  senior  to  the  one  retained  junior  teacher,  they  would  not  have 
been  retained  in  any  event.  Only  the  most  senior  of  them  would  have  been  retained,  and  as 
to  that  teacher,  the  error  by  the  district  was  prejudicial.  As  to  the  others,  the  error  was  not 
prejudicial.  Pursuant  to  section  44949(c)(3),  a  nonprejudicial  error  does  not  constitute  a 
cause  to  dismiss  the  charges. 

In  Alexander,  the  court  after  concluding  the  school  district  acted  improperly, 
instructed  the  lower  court  to  reexamine  the  district’s  decisions  in  the  following  language: 

Because  at  least  some  of the  persons  skipped  should  have  received  the  notices,  a 
corresponding  number  of the  most  senior  of the  employees  who  were  not  reemployed 
must  have  been  improperly  given  notices.  The  trial  court  must  determine  which  of  the 
Teachers  suffered  prejudicial  error.  Alexander  v.  Board  of  Trustees  of the  Delano 
Joint  Union  High  School  District,  supra  at  576. 

Section  44949(c)(3)  and  Alexander  therefore  require  the  District  to  retain  only  that 
number  of  senior  teachers  which  corresponds  to  the  number  of junior  teachers  the  District 
improperly  retained.  There  is  nothing  in  sections  44955(b)  and  (d)  that  support  respondents’ 
argument  that  all  senior  qualified  employees  must  be  retained. 

16. 

Cause  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  District 

to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  cause  for  the  reduction  or 
discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  related  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and 
the  pupils  thereof.  A  preponderance  of  the  evidence  sustained  the  charges  set  forth  in  the 
Amended  Accusation.  It  is  recommended  that  the  Board  give  respondents,  except  those 
indicated  in  Legal  Conclusions  3,  8,  10,  and  14,  notice  before  May  15,  2004,  that  their 
services  are  longer  be  required  by  the  District.
