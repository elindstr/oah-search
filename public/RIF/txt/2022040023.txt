BEFORE THE 
BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE 
COMPTON UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 

In the Matter of the Reduction in Force of: 

CERTIFICATED TEACHERS OF THE COMPTON UNIFIED 

SCHOOL DISTRICT, 

Respondents. 

OAH No. 2022040023 

PROPOSED DECISION 

Joseph D. Montoya, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), Office of Administrative 

Hearings (OAH), State of California, heard this matter on May 3, 2022, via 

videoconference. 

Adam J. Fiss and Michell M. Holmes, Littler Mendelson, P.C., attorneys at law, 

represented the Compton Unified School District (District).

Stephanie Joseph, Staff Counsel, California Teachers Association, represented 

respondents Orlando Perez, Cleveland Palmer, and George Luna. Only respondent 

Luna appeared and participated in the hearing on May 3, 2022. 

Respondents Perez and Palmer did not appear at the May 3, 2022 hearing 

because they reached a settlement with the District prior to the hearing date. Those 

settlement agreements were subject to approval by the Board of Trustees of the 

District (Board), which was slated to consider the agreements at its next meeting, then 

scheduled for May 10, 2022. Counsel agreed to go forward with the case as it 

pertained to respondent Luna, and agreed to set a further hearing on the morning of 

May 13, 2022, so that if the settlement agreements were not approved by the Board, 

the parties would try the case as to respondents Perez and/or Palmer. 

On May 11, 2022, District counsel gave notice that the settlements with Perez 

and Palmer had been approved, and the hearing then set for May 13, 2022, went off-

calendar. 

Oral and documentary evidence was received during the May 3, 2022 hearing. 

The record was closed on May 12, 2022, and the matter was submitted for decision on 

that date. 

FACTUAL FINDINGS 

The Parties and Jurisdiction 

1. 

Complainant Kimberley Tresvant, Ed.D., filed and maintained the 

Statement of Reduction in Force while acting in her official capacity as Executive 

Director, Human Resources, for the District.

2. 

Respondent George Luna (Respondent) is a certificated teacher 

employed by the District.

3. 

On March 8, 2022, the Board adopted Resolution number 32, pertaining 

to the reduction or elimination of services within the District (Reduction Resolution).  

The purpose of the Reduction Resolution was to reduce and discontinue particular 

2

kinds of certificated services no later than the beginning of the 2022-2023 school year. 

Specifically, the resolution requires the reduction of 2.5 “FTE”—Full Time Equivalents—

by reducing three types of services.

4. 

The FTEs that the Board determined to reduce by the Reduction 

Resolution are as follows: 

Culinary Arts/Advance Culinary

1.0 

Automotive Technology (1B & B)/Auto Specializations  

1.0 

Visual/Commercial Arts 

Total FTE reductions, all programs 

  .5 

2.5 

5. 

The services which the District seeks to discontinue or reduce are 

particular kinds of services that may be reduced or discontinued under Education 

Code section 44955. (Further statutory citations are to the Education Code unless 

otherwise noted.) 

6. 

The decision by the Board to reduce or discontinue services was neither 

arbitrary nor capricious, but rather was a proper exercise of the District’s discretion. 

The Board determined, after examining the labor market, that the courses to be 

reduced, being vocational education, were not needed. 

7. 

The reduction and discontinuation of services is related to the welfare of 

the District and its pupils, and it has become necessary to decrease the number of 

certificated employees as determined by the Board. 

8. 

On March 11, 2022, Respondent was served with a notice that the 

Superintendent of the District had recommended to the Board that Respondent’s 

3

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
services would not be required for the 2022-2023 school year. The notice apprised 

Respondent of his right to a hearing. Respondent made a timely request for a hearing. 

9. 

On April 6, 2022, the District wrote Respondent, acknowledging his 

request for a hearing, and transmitted to him a copy of the District Statement of 

Reduction in Force, a Notice of Hearing, and a Notice of Participation. Copies of 

pertinent provisions of the Education Code and Government Code were also provided 

to Respondent. The Notice of Hearing stated the hearing would be held on April 15, 

2022. 

10. 

Thereafter, the parties stipulated that the hearing would be continued to 

May 3, 2022, and OAH ordered the continuance of the hearing. The stipulation further 

stated that this proposed decision would be due May 25, 2022.

11. 

All jurisdictional requirements have been met. 

Tie Break Criteria and the Seniority List 

12.  On March 8, 2022, the Board adopted resolution number 21/22-34, which 

established criteria for order of layoff and reemployment following layoff for 

employees with equal seniority. However, none of the respondents share a seniority 

date.

13. 

District staff, under Dr. Tresvant’s direction, prepared a seniority list, 

ranking all certificated employees’ seniority. No evidence was offered to establish that 

the seniority list was inaccurate. 

4

Respondent Luna’s Case 

14.

Respondent Luna credibly testified regarding his qualifications to teach 

automotive repair courses, and regarding the importance of such courses in public 

schools. 

15. 

Respondent has been employed by the District since August 2016, 

teaching at Centennial High School. He previously taught as an automotive specialist 

instructor at other high schools in southern California, beginning in September 2003. 

He has been an automotive repair technician at dealerships and companies operating 

their own fleet of vehicles.

16.

Respondent holds a Clear Designated Subjects Vocational Education 

Teaching Credential, which is valid through November 1, 2027. He is currently certified 

by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) as a Maintenance and 

Light Repair Technician; that certification is valid through June 30, 2024. He has 

previously been certified by ASE in Engine Repair Recent (expired December 31, 2021) 

and Brakes Recent, as well as Automotive Parts. 

17. 

Respondent has been active in attempting to obtain certification for the 

District’s auto repair program from the National Automotive Teachers Education 

Program (NATEF). He believes he was very close to obtaining that certification, which 

would assist in obtaining resources such as equipment and even vehicles that students 

could train on. Luna believes NATEF certification could open doors for students later 

seeking employment in auto dealerships.

18. 

Respondent Luna asserted that the District should maintain automotive 

repair training courses, as not every student has college as a goal, and because there 

are jobs available for trained automotive repair technicians.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1.

Jurisdiction was established to proceed in this matter, pursuant to 

sections 44949 and 44955, based on Factual Findings 1 through 11. 

2. 

A district may reduce particular kind of services (PKS) within the meaning 

of section 44955, subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service 

to students shall not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce 

services’ by determining that proffered services shall be reduced in extent because 

fewer employees are made available to deal with the pupils involved.” (

 (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 178-179 (

).) The Court of 

Appeal has made clear that a PKS reduction does not have to lead to fewer classrooms 

or classes; laying off some teachers amounts to a proper reduction. (

. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838, 853-855; see also 

 (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 631, 637; 

(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 32.) 

3. 

The services to be discontinued by the District are particular kinds of 

services within the meaning of section 44955. The Board’s decision to reduce or 

discontinue the identified services was neither arbitrary nor capricious and was a 

proper exercise of its discretion. The evidence indicated that the Board considered the 

current labor market and determined that its educational priorities should change. It is 

presumed that the Board regularly performed its duty in making its decision, and that 

it did not act arbitrarily or capriciously. (Evid. Code, § 664.) No evidence was offered to 

rebut that presumption. 

4. 

Respondent Luna argued that the Board should re-consider its decision 

to eliminate the auto program at Centennial High School. Plainly, reasonable minds 

6

might differ as to whether the automotive training course should be discontinued. 

However, the courts are not allowed to substitute their judgment for the judgment of 

a school board in these situations; and the undersigned cannot substitute his 

judgment for that of the Board either. (

(1996) 41 

Cal.App.4th 1571, 1588-1589; 

Cal.App.4th 334.)

(2009) 172 

5. 

A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer 

to a continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to fill. In doing 

so, the senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that 

position. (

 (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469.) At the same 

time, a junior teacher may be given retention priority by the District over one or more 

senior teachers, that teacher may be “skipped”—not laid off while more senior 

employees are laid off—if the junior teacher possesses skills or capabilities not 

possessed by more senior colleagues, which must be necessary to teach a course or 

course of study that is specifically needed in the District. (

 (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 399; 

 (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 

831.)

6. 

Respondent Luna did not demonstrate that he was entitled to bump 

another, more junior, teacher. Nor was he able to demonstrate that a junior teacher 

had been improperly skipped. There was no challenge to the seniority list, and there 

was no evidence that a junior teacher had been retained. 

7. 

No certificated employee junior to any Respondent was retained by the 

District to render a service for which a Respondent was certificated and qualified to 

render.

ORDER

Respondent George Luna may be served with a final lay off notice.
