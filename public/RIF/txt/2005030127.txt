4. 

On  March  8,  2005,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Lake  Tahoe  Unified  School

this  resolution  is  29.7  FTE  certificated  positions.  The  Board  has  determined  that  the  services 
of  a  corresponding  number  of  certificated  employees  shall  be  terminated  at  the  close  of  the 
current  2004-05  school  year.

This  stipulation  reduces  the  proposed  layoffs  from  29.7  FTE  to  12.57  FTE  certificated 
positions,  corresponding  to  16  named  respondents. ' 

9.- 

Respondents  contend  that  the  District  is  retaining  a  teacher  with  less  seniority  to 
fill  a  position  that  more  senior  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  fill.  The  District 
intends  to  move  an  administrator  (Jim  Valdes)  into  a  position  that  can  be  filled  with  a 
multiple  subject  teaching  credential.  Mr.  Valdes  has  a  standard  elementary  teaching 
credential,  and  can  teach  in  an  elementary  position  as  well  as  in  a  kindergarten  —  ninth  grade 
(K-9)  social  science  position  as  well  as  in  a  K-9  physical  education  position.  The  District 
plans  to  assign  him  to  an  elementary  school  teaching  position  for  the  2005-06  school  year. 
The  issue  is  whether  Mr.  Valdes,  who  taught  over  the  first  four  years  of  his  employment  with 
the  District  and  who  then  served  as  an  administrator  since  approximately  1987,  retains  his 
original  seniority  date  of  September  1983  for  bumping  purposes,  or  whether  his  seniority 
should  be  adjusted  to  include  a  maximum  of  seven  years  (four  years  as  a  classroom  teacher  . 
plus  three  years  as  an  administrator)  based  upon  respondents’  interpretation  of  Education 
Code  section  44956.5.  Several  respondents  are  elementary  school  teachers  who,  if  Mr. 
Valdes  only  receives  three  years  of  credit  for  time  served  as  an  administrator,  would  be  more 
senior  to  Mr.  Valdes. 

10. 

Education  Code  section  44956.5  provides  that: 

For  a  certificated  employee  initially  employed  in  an  administrative 
position  on  or  after  July  1,  1983,  who  transfers  to  a  teaching 
position,  the  period  of  employment  in  the  administrative  position 
shall  not  be  included  in  determining  seniority  for  purposes  of 
Sections  44955  and  44956,  except  school  site  administrators  who 
shall  earn  up  to  a  maximum  of  three  years  seniority  while  serving 
as  site  administrators. 

Respondents  argue  that  a  reading  of  the  plain  language  of  this  statute  appears  to 

mandate  that  no  site  administrator  can  earn  more  than  three  years  seniority  for  purposes  of 
layoff  and  bumping  while  serving  as  a  site  administrator.  The  District  contends  that  the 
language  “initially  employed”  means  that  the  three  year  limitation  applies  only  to  certificated 
individuals  who  were  employed  in  the  first  instance  as  site  administrators  and  who  were  not 
initially  employed  as  teachers. 

The  District  is  correct.  The  general  rule  for  determining  the  seniority  of  certificated 

employees  is  set  forth  in  Education  Code  section  44845  which  provides:  “Every  probationary 
or  permanent  employee  employed  after  June  30,  1947,  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been 
employed  on  the  date  upon  which  he  first  rendered  paid  service  in  a  probationary  position.” 

  

'  Respondents  remaining  include:  Harold  R.  Comlossy  (.4  FTE),  Jonathan  Conroy  (.6  FTE),  Jesus  Cortes-Acosta, 
Nancy  Dalton,  Michael  Davis,  Odette  Hodgkinson  (.2  FTE),  Gregory  Kuntz,  Robin  Milaeger  (.47  FTE),  Margaret 
Munoz,  Demetrius  Olsen,  Rhonda  Riggs,  Tisha  Seims,  Charna  Silver  (.5  FTE),  Doug  Watenpool,  Heather  Wildman 
(.4  FTE),  and  Sabrina  Zalles.

A  teacher  has  but  one  first  date  of  paid  service,  and  it  is  that  date,  rather  than  tenure,  that 
governs  a  layoff.  (San  Jose  Teachers  Association  vy.  Allen  (1983)  144  Cal.App.3d  627.)  It 
appears  that  the  Legislature  carved  out  a  limited  exception  to  the  general  seniority  rule  for 
those  employees  initially  hired  as  administrators  and  later  transferred  to  teaching  positions. 
And  it  also  appears  that  the  Legislature  purposefully  omitted  a  parallel  exception  for 
employees  initially  hired  as  teachers  and  subsequently  transferred  to  administrative  positions. 
Public  policy  considerations  support  this  interpretation.  If  respondents’  interpretation  is 

"  accepted,  teachers  would  be  discouraged  from  promoting  into  administrator  positions 

because  they  would  risk  forfeiture  of  multiple  years  of  service  while  serving  as 
administrators. 

11. 

That  the  Legislature  recognizes  these  concerns  is  seen  in  other  statutes  relating 

to  teachers  retaining  their  permanent  teacher  classifications  when  promoted  into 
administrative  or  supervisory  positions.  Thus,  Education  Code  section  44893  provides:  “A 
permanent  employee  when  advanced  from  a  teaching  position  to  an  administrative  or 
supervisory  position,  or  assigned  any  special  or  other  type  of  work,  or  given  special 
classification  or  designation  requiring  certification  qualifications,  shall  retain  his  permanent 
.  Classification  as  a  classroom  teacher.”  Similarly,  when  teachers  are  assigned  to  a  position  in 
classified  service  of  the  same  district,  and  later  return  to  a  teaching  position,  they  retain  all 
seniority  and  tenure  rights  upon  their  return  shall  be  treated  as  if  there  had  not  been  an 
interruption  in  their  certificated  service.  (Ed.  Code,  §  44063.)  There  is  no  reason  why  a 
teacher,  moving  between  certificated  and  classified  service,  should  be  treated  more  favorably 
than  another  teacher,  such  as  Mr.  Valdes,  who is  promoted  to  an  administrative position 
without  leaving  certificated  service. 

For  these  reasons,  the District  correctly  determined  that  the  seniority  date  for  Jim 

Valdes is  September  20,  1983,  the  date  he  first  rendered  paid  service  in  a  probationary 
position  for  the  District. 

12. 

Except  as  provided  by  statute,  no  permanent  or  probationary  certificated 

employee  with  less  seniority  is  being  retained  to  render  a  service  which  respondents,  or  any 
of  them,  are  certificated  and  competent  to  render.  As  between  employees  who  first  rendered 
paid  service  to  the  District  on  the  same  date,  the  order  of  termination  has  been  based  solely 
on  the  needs  of  the  District  and  the  students  thereof. 

13. 

_  The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  the  particular  kinds  of  services  set  forth  in 

Resolution  No.  2004/2005-19  are  related  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  students 
~  thereof  within  the  meaning  of Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  The  decision  to- 
reduce  or  discontinue  these  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  but  rather  a  proper 
exercise  of  discretion  of  the  District.

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

l. 

Jurisdiction  for  the  subject  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code 

sections  44949  and  44955,  and  all  notices  and  other  requirements  of  those  sections  have  been. 
provided  as  required. 

2. 

Cause  exists  to  redtice  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  Lake  Tahoe 
Unified  School  District  due  to  the  reduction  and  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  - 
services.  The  cause  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof  within 
the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949. 

ORDER 

Notice  shall  be  given  to  respondents  occupying  up  to  12.57  FTE  that  their  services 

will  not  be  required  for  the  2005-2006  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  or 
discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services.
