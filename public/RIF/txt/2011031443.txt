SUMMARY

The Board of Trustees of the Hollister School District decided to discontinue
particular kinds of services provided by teachers in the 2011-2012 school year for budgetary
reasons. The decision was not related to the competency and dedication of those whose
services were proposed to be eliminated. The process complied with Education Code
requirements.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

2.

Gary L. McIntire, Ed.D., filed the Accusation in his official capacity as

Superintendent of the Hollister School District (District).

All Respondents are certificated employees of the District. A list of the

Respondents is attached as Exhibit A.

3.

On February 15, 2011, the Board of Trustees of the Hollister School District

(Board) adopted Resolution 24:10-11, which contains criteria to be used to determine the
order of termination of certificated employees with the same first date of paid service (tie-
breaking criteria). In pertinent part, the Resolution states:

[T]hat the below-listed criteria, not in order of priority, be used
in determining the order of termination . . . and that the
Superintendent or designee applies the adopted criteria to the
affected employees to determine order of termination as related
to the needs of the District and its students, as described in the
table appended to this Resolution (Appendix A).

The criteria are listed, “not in order of priority,” as follows:

1) Breadth of credential authorization

Multiple credentials or authorizations issued by the
California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, allowing
flexibility of assignment and ability to undertake multiple
assignments as District’s needs change.

2) Advanced degrees in current assignment or credential-related
subject areas on file with the Hollister School District.

3) Number of post-baccalaureate accredited college units on file
with the Hollister School District in current assignment or
credential-related areas.

4) Teaching experience in multiple subjects or grade levels in
the Hollister School District.

5) Number of years teaching in California public elementary
and secondary schools outside of the Hollister School District.

If and only if employees with common dates of hire have equal
qualifications based upon application of the above criteria, the
District, in the presence of a representative from HESTA if
requested, will then break ties by utilizing a lottery.

4.

Appendix A to Resolution 24:10-11 is entitled “Description of

Tie-

Breaker Criteria.” It states:

# 1: Breadth of Credential Authorization – For every
credential, certificate or authorization awarded by the California
Commission on Teacher Credentialing as of February 15, 2011,

2

an individual will receive 10,000 points. Certificates earned at
workshops, and credentials that are not from California do not
count.

# 2: Advanced Degrees – For every Masters or Doctorate from
an accredited university that the District had on file as of
September 10, 2010 (HESTA contract
§ 11.9.3), an individual will receive 15,300 points.

#3: Number of Post-Baccalaureate Accredited College Units
– For each semester unit, an individual will receive 110 points.
The Baccalaureate can be either a BA or BS; transcripts had to
have been on file in the District Office as of September 10,
2010. (HESTA contract § 11.9.3)

#4: Teaching Experience in multiple subjects/grade levels –
For every different past and present assignment in the Hollister
School District, an individual may receive up to 15 points total,
provided you taught in that assignment for a year or more (7.5
points for half a year or for a semester). Points are assigned per
assignment; multiple years in the same assignment receive a
maximum of 15 total points, regardless of the number of years
in that assignment. Teachers newly assigned to a grade level or
subject area for the 2010/11 school year, and who have taught in
that assignment for at least half the school year, will receive 15
points in recognition of that assignment.

#5: Number of Years teaching in California public
elementary and/or secondary schools – An individual will
receive 1.3 points per year for every year taught in California,
outside of Hollister, but only for public school service.

(Emphasis in original.)

5.

Dennis D. Kurtz, Ph.D., Director of Personnel for the District, drafted a memo
describing how the process would be implemented and a Seniority Tie Breaker Worksheet to
be used to tally each affected teacher’s points. He supplied these documents to the Board
members for their consideration as they decided whether to issue Resolution 24:10-11.

6.

On March 8, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution 30:10-11, in which the

Board resolved to reduce or eliminate particular kinds of services at the close of the current
school year. The reduction of the following full-time equivalent (FTE) positions was
approved and are anticipated:

7.

Kurtz credibly testified concerning the reason for the projected reduction in

services and the basis for the decisions regarding which services to reduce. The District
continues to be in poor condition financially, and is currently in “negative status.” The state
fiscal advisor has instructed the District to reduce expenditures, and staffing is a significant
portion of the budget. The District plans some significant changes in grade level
configuration. For example, a 6th grade class will be moved from a middle school to an
elementary school site. That move will result in the need for one less teacher. In addition,
an early childhood special education program is moving to the County Office of Education.

8.

Attrition was considered in factoring the reductions, and will continue to be.

Prior to March 15, 2011, only one employee had announced his or her resignation or
retirement.

9.

All state-mandated services will be provided as required in school year 2011-

2012 under the proposed reductions.

10.

On March 10, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution 29:10-11. It states “that the
attached Order of Certificated Employment – ‘Seniority List’ represents the order of first day
of paid service of permanent and probationary certificated employees in the Hollister School
District and will be used to determine the order of certificated layoff.”

District staff makes every effort to ensure that the Seniority List is accurate and up to

date. Every fall the list is sent to employees with a request to check it for accuracy. This
was repeated again in late December 2010 or January of this year. As corrections come in,
Kurtz makes the changes. This includes application of the tie-breaker criteria. Kurtz
employs the tie-breaker worksheet to determine the order of employees with the same start
date.

4

11.

On March 10, 2011, written notice of the recommendation that their services
will not be required for the 2011-2012 school year (the preliminary notice) was personally
served on affected employees. The documents were also sent by registered mail.

12.

Each of the Respondents filed a timely request for hearing. Accordingly, an

Accusation was filed and served. Each Respondent filed a timely notice of defense.

13.

Kurtz credibly testified about the basis for his decisions regarding which

teachers and how many received a preliminary notice. Seven temporary teachers were given
notices of non-reelection, and this was factored into the decision. For the other reductions,
he looked at the total number of reductions needed and considered credentials, whether the
tie-breaking criteria would be implemented, bumping rights, and other factors. For example,
the total reduction for math was 1.0 FTE, but 1.8 FTE were noticed. This resulted in the total
number noticed being slightly higher than the total authorized reductions.

14.

On April 6, 2011, Respondent Lisa Jelinek was notified that the District was

withdrawing her preliminary notice and that her services would be needed in 2011-2012.

Objections of particular teachers/employees

15.

Frederick Brewster holds a multiple subject credential, a CLAD, and a clear

administrator credential. He teaches 7th and 8th grade math, and has been attempting to earn
a math authorization from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) for
six years. Brewster related a near-Kafkaesque tale of attempts to satisfy the CTC. He is now
very close to completing the requirements, and requests the Board grant him a waiver.
Brewster presents a compelling case, but no authority exists to order the Board to grant a
waiver to a teacher.

16.

Diana Flores holds a multiple subject credential and a CLAD. The District
noted her seniority date as August 24, 2005, for some years. Flores asserts that she began
teaching for the District in 1999 pursuant to an emergency credential and only this year
learned that she was entitled to a seniority date commensurate with that date.

If the records verify that she is entitled to an earlier seniority date, the District shall

assign Flores a new seniority date in 1999 and rescind her layoff notice.

17.

Erinn Mitchell holds a music credential and teaches middle school band and
choir. She testified that she was hired to work alongside an experienced teacher so that she
would have “the maximum amount of training to continue the program.” She requests that
the District retain her because of her special training and experience, in preference to another
teacher with more seniority; in essence, she requests to be “skipped.” No authority exists for
such an order.

5

18.

Jananne Gaver holds a multiple subject credential, a CLAD, and an

administrative credential. Previously, her seniority date with the District was noted as
August 21, 2002. In January 2011, an error was discovered by Kurtz and the date was
changed to January 26, 2004. Gaver objects to the change.

The disagreement is grounded in Gaver’s service in an administrative position.
Several years ago she was considering applying to be a vice-principal or for a position in the
District office. According to Gaver, Kurtz advised her to take the office position because of
his prediction that the vice-principal job would be eliminated in the near future. (Kurtz does
not recall the conversation.) Further, Gaver contends that District staff member Pam Little
(Little’s actual position was not identified) told her that only two years can be counted for
seniority purposes when one is working as an administrator.

Gaver did not know there was a difference between working at a school site versus at

the District office. She therefore took the position in the office, not realizing that this
decision would cost her in seniority. She maintains that if she had known about the
Education Code provisions concerning accrual of time for administrators, she would have
made a different decision.

19.

The Parties stipulated that Erinn Mitchell be given credit for 6.5 years of paid

service pursuant to the tie-breaker criteria. Her position on the Seniority List shall be
corrected accordingly.

20.

The Parties stipulated that Barbara Penney be given credit for an additional 18
units of credit pursuant to the tie-breaker criteria. Her position on the Seniority List shall be
corrected accordingly.

21.

The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the identified services was

made solely on the basis of the needs of the District and its pupils.

22.

No permanent or probationary employee with less seniority is being retained

to render a service which any Respondent is certificated and competent to render.

23.

All contentions made by Respondent not specifically addressed herein are

found to be without merit and are rejected.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

All notices and other requirements of Education Code sections 44949 and

44955 have been provided as required. The District established jurisdiction for this
proceeding as to each Respondent.

2.

Respondents contend that the District has “over noticed,” in that more teachers

received preliminary notices than are required to effectuate the reduction in services. This
argument is without merit.

6

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), provides, in pertinent part, that

“whenever a particular kind of service is to be reduced or discontinued not later than the
beginning of the following school year . . . the governing board may terminate the services of
not more than a corresponding percentage of the certificated employees of the district . . . at
the close of the school year.” This provision implies that a board must make a good faith
effort to determine what services need to be reduced, to what extent, and who should be
noticed. Here, the evidence established a careful consideration of all of the facts and
circumstances prior to the issuance of the notices. No authority was presented to support the
proposition that a District must commit at this stage in the process to exactly who and how
many teachers will receive a final notice.

3.

Cause was established as required by Education Code section 44955 to

reduce the number of certificated employees of the District due to the reduction and
discontinuation of particular kinds of services.

4.

Respondent Gaver contends that the District should be estopped from

changing her seniority date because she was given incorrect information by District staff
and she relied on the information to her detriment. Equitable estoppel is available against a
public agency if certain elements are met. The elements are: (1) a representation or
concealment of material facts (2) made with knowledge of the facts (3) to a party ignorant
of the truth (4) with intention that the latter act upon it and (5) the party must have been
induced to act upon it. (See 7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (1974 ed.), Equity § 132, p.
5352, and cases cited therein.) “Where one of these elements is missing there can be no
estoppel.” (California School Employees Assn. v. Jefferson Elementary School District
(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 668, 692.) No showing was made that anyone from the District
intentionally concealed a known material fact with the intent that Garver act on it to her
detriment, or that Garver was induced to act upon it to her detriment. Rather, the evidence
established that Garver and certain District staff were was ignorant of the relevant Education
Code provision, that she was therefore given an incorrect seniority date, and that the date was
corrected when the error was discovered.

In addition, case law provides that estoppel should not be invoked against the

government when it would cause harm to a specific public policy or the public interest.
(Shoban v. Board of Trustees of the Desert Center Unified School District (1969) 276
Cal.App.2d 534; Fleice v. Chualar Union Elementary School District (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 886, 893 [estoppel cannot be invoked to contravene statutory provisions that
define an agency’s powers].) The seniority dates of teachers are regulated by the
Education Code. Section 44956.5 provides that employees do not gain time for seniority
purposes when they work in an administrative position that is not at a school site.
Application of equitable estoppel in the instant case would defeat the statutory scheme
created by the Legislature that establishes seniority rights for teachers and provide Garver
with greater rights than other employees.

Accordingly, there is no basis in fact or law to justify granting the requested relief.
