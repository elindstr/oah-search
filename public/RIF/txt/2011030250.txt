SUMMARY OF PROPOSED DECISION

The Board of Education of the Cajon Valley Union School District determined to
reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services provided by teachers for budgetary reasons.
The decision was not related to the competency and/or dedication of the individuals whose
services are proposed to be reduced or eliminated.

District staff carried out the Board’s decision by using a selection process involving

review of credentials and seniority, “bumping” and breaking ties between/among employees
with the same first date of paid service. The selection process was in accordance with the
requirements of the Education Code.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Respondents listed in Exhibit “A” (Respondents) are certificated employees of

the Cajon Valley Union School District (District).

2.

On March 8, 2011, the District’s Governing Board (Board) took action to
reduce or eliminate particular kinds of certificated services, commencing the 2011-2012
school year; in the same resolution, the Board adopted tie breaker criteria; in a separate
resolution, the Board released its temporary employees.

3.

Beginning March 9, 2011 but no later than March 15, 2011, Janice Cook, the
District’s Superintendent (Superintendent), served Respondents with written notice that she
recommended not to re-employ them in the 2011-2012 school year and stated the reasons
therefor. In addition, the notice advised Respondents of the right to hearing, that the request
for hearing must be delivered to the District’s office no later than March 21, 2011, and that
the failure to request a hearing would constitute waiver of the right to a hearing.

4.

The Superintendent served notice on probationary and permanent certificated

employees (Exh. 2), temporary certificated employees (Exh. 3) and preschool certificated
employees (Exh. 4).

The notice to temporary employees stated in pertinent part:

“As a temporary certificated employee, the Board of Trustees may release you
from employment pursuant to Education Code section 44954. Additionally, in certain
limited circumstances, temporary certificated employees associated with a categorical
program maybe be entitled to participate in the layoff proceedings applicable to
probationary and permanent employees under Education Code sections 44949 and
44955. That will take place during the month of April. The District has decided to
provide you with a limited right to request a hearing under the provisions of
Education Code section 44955. By providing this limited precautionary right to
request a hearing, it is not the District’s intent to convert your temporary employment
status to that of a probationary or permanent employee. The District maintains, and
will assert at these proceedings, that your employment status as a temporary
employee does not entitle you to probationary or permanent status and that your
release is proper. You are therefore notified that pursuant to Education Code sections
44949 and 44955 your services will not be required for the 2011-2012 school year.”

Respondents submitted a Request for Hearing to determine if there was cause for not

re-employing him/her for the ensuing school year.

5.

On March 23, 2011, the Superintendent made and filed an Accusation for lay-

off of certificated employees. She served each individual who submitted a Request for
Hearing with an Accusation, Notice of Defense, Notice of Hearing and related materials.

2

Respondents submitted a Notice of Defense.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements were satisfied.

6.

7.

There was no appearance by or on behalf of Respondents Natoshia Bartley,

Kendall Brown, Rebecca Chui, Alexis Estupinian, Sara Harrell, Allison Hyde, Nicole
Kemper, Courtney Lobue, Suzin Meyers, Nicole Norton, Katherine O’Donoghue, Sarah Otte,
Robin Reese and/or Brian Valente.

8.

Prior to conclusion of the hearing, the District rescinded layoff notices issued

to Respondents Christina Henson, Laura Graham, Elizabeth Avelar, Kathleen Floyd, Daniela
Ruiz-Jo, Rachel Conroy, Amanda Flickinger, Lindsey Schantz, Neil Saffer, Teryn Gilmore,
Amie Tillman-Harris, Kimberley Wright, Delia Villanueva, Timothy Staninger, Carol
Knight, Laura Stabile and Leticia Quintana.

9.

On March 8, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution number 03-11-911 JC,

ordering the release of temporary employees to effectuate the reduction of particular kinds of
services pursuant to Education Code sections 44949, 44954 and 44955. In general, the
District employs temporary certificated employees under the authorizations provided in
Education Code sections 44909 (categorical programs) and 44920 (replacement for teachers
on leave of absence).

At this time, funding for the District’s categorical programs is uncertain. Resolution

number 03-11-911 JC states, in pertinent part:

“. . . the Superintendent has indicated that the reduction in particular kinds of
services is related to the loss or potential loss of revenue limit funding and of certain
categorical or specially-funded programs, the possibility of probationary and
permanent teachers returning from leaves of absence, and other considerations that
relate directly to the justification for employment of temporary certificated
employees; . . .”

10.

Pursuant to Education Code sections 44919 and 44920, the District may

employ no more temporary teachers than it has permanent and probationary teachers on
leave of absence. Respondents contend that the status of some of the temporary employees is
questionable but offered no evidence in support of this argument. The Assistant
Superintendent testified that the District has agreed to perform an audit of temporary teachers
“to confirm whether teachers are properly classified as temporary.”

11.

The District operates a State funded preschool program (Program). The
District has received notice that funding for the Program will be reduced by 36 percent
(36%), but the District is concerned that it will be terminated completely. As such, the
District has noticed all 24 pre-school teachers. If the funding issue is resolved, the District
will recall the pre-school teachers in order of seniority.

12.

On March 8, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution number 03-11-910 JC and

thereby took action to reduce or eliminate the following particular kinds of certificated
services, commencing 2011-2012 school year as follows:

The proposed reductions totaled 163.02 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions.

13.

The District considered all positively assured attrition in determining the

actual number of final layoff notices to be delivered to its certificated employees.

14.

Kari Hull, the District’s Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services

(Assistant Superintendent), was responsible for implementing the technical aspects of the
layoff. She developed a seniority list for probationary or permanent certificated employees
who received preliminary notices of layoff. It included, among other matters, the teacher’s
name, seniority date, status, site, assignment, English Language Certification (if any) and
credential(s).

The seniority date was based on the first date of paid service rendered in a

probationary position.1 A teacher hired as a probationary employee who worked as a
substitute or temporary employee for at least 75 percent (75%) of the school days during the
previous year and who had performed the duties normally required of a certificated employee
of the District was deemed to have served a complete school year as a probationary
employee if that individual was employed as a probationary employee for the following
school year. The individual was entitled to have that earlier year counted as a year of
probationary service. The prior year was “tacked” on for seniority purposes but only one
year could be tacked.2

1

2

Education Code section 44845.

Education Code section 44918.

5

15.

The District used the seniority list to develop a proposed order of layoff and

used the “bumping” list to determine the least senior employees currently assigned in the
various services being reduced. The District then determined whether the least senior
employees held credentials in another area that would entitle them to “bump” other junior
employees. In determining who would be laid off for each kind of service reduced, the
District counted the number of reductions and determined the impact on incumbent staff in
inverse order of seniority. The District then checked the credentials of affected individuals
and whether they could “bump” other employees.

16.

Some employees named as Respondents have the same seniority date. In

compliance with Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), in order to determine the
order of termination of employees with the same seniority date, the Board adopted “Criteria
to be Applied to Determine Order of Layoff for those Certificated Employees With the Same
Date of First Paid Probationary Service.” According to the evidence in the record, the
District properly applied this tie breaker criteria to rank employees hired on the same date;
under these criteria the District properly retained certain employees while Respondents were
properly given notice that their services would no longer be required for the ensuing school
year.

17.

As a result of the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services

and/or bumping, the following Respondents will experience a partial reduction of position.

 For the 2010-2011 school year, Respondent Linda Hirsch Miller has a 1.0
FTE position. For the ensuing school year, her position will be reduced by
.40 FTE; she will retain .60 FTE position.

 For the 2010-2011 school year, Respondent Casey Lange has a 1.0 FTE

position. For the ensuing school year, her position will be reduced by .40
FTE; she will retain .60 FTE position.

 For the 2010-2011 school year, Respondent Katherine O’Donohue has 1.0
FTE position. For the ensuing school year, her position will be reduced by
.35 FTE; she will retain .65 FTE position.

 For the 2010-2011 school year, Respondent Jason Robins has a .80 FTE
position. For the ensuing school year, his position will be reduced by .40
FTE; he will retain .60 FTE position.

18.

The services that the District proposed to reduce were “particular kinds of

services” that can be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section
44955. The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue these particular kinds of services was
not arbitrary or capricious but constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

19.

The District’s reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services related to

the welfare of the District and its pupils. The reduction or elimination of particular kinds of
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the District as
determined by the Board.

6

20.

No certificated employee junior to any Respondent has been retained to

perform services that any Respondent was certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 and

44955. All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in these sections are satisfied.

2.

A District may reduce services within the meaning of Education Code section
44955, subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall
not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford vs. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.)

3.

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the District

to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services. The cause for the reduction or
discontinuance of particular kinds of services is related solely to the welfare of the schools
and the pupils thereof.

4.

Respondents employed pursuant to Education Code section 44920 are

temporary employees and can be dismissed without a right to participate in this proceeding.
As to those Respondents, the District may take action to dismiss them as the law allows
regarding temporary employees.

5.

As reflected in case law, categorically funded teachers are treated like

temporary employees. (Zalac v. Ferndale Unified School District (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838,
840-841 [A kindergarten teacher’s first two years of employment was as a temporary
employee in a categorically funded program pursuant to Education Code section 44909].) In
Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v. Bakersfield City School District (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 1260, the Court of Appeal found that teachers in categorically funded positions
“are treated in much the same way [as temporary employees] in that they may be dismissed
without the formalities required for probationary and permanent employees in the event the
program expires or is terminated, and their service does not count toward acquiring
permanent status (unless they are reemployed the following year in a probationary position).”
Here, there is no evidence that the categorical programs have expired. However, the
Bakersfield Court, citing Zalac, noted the purpose of Education Code section 44909 was “‘to
prevent a person from acquiring probationary status solely through teaching in a
categorically funded program. This permits the hiring of qualified persons for categorically
funded programs of undetermined duration without incurring responsibility to grant tenured
status based on such teaching services alone.’ [Citation.] The section ‘was intended to give
school districts flexibility in the operation of special educational programs to supplement
their regular program and to relieve them from having a surplus of probationary or

7

permanent teachers when project funds are terminated or cut back.’ [Citation.]” (Bakersfield
Elementary Teachers Association v. Bakersfield City School District, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th
1260, 1286.) To characterize categorically funded Respondents as probationary employees
would be contrary to that purpose. (See also Haase v. San Diego Community College
District (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 913 [for additional support through analysis of a certificated
employee in a categorically funded position in a community college district not found to be a
probationary employee].)

6.

Furthermore, in Education Code section 44909, the Legislature directed

categorically funded employees who replace other teachers to be subject to the provisions of
Education Code section 44918, but “without regard to other requirements of this code
respecting the termination of probationary or permanent employees.” This direction provides
further support for the conclusion reached here, that categorically funded employees are
treated as temporary employees.

7.

Thus, in this case, the Respondents in categorically funded programs are

temporary employees. The District may dismiss them in the manner the law allows
regarding temporary employees. It is noted that the District served these Respondents with
the jurisdictional documents and provided them the opportunity to participate in the instant
hearing. These Respondents participated in the hearing to the fullest extent possible, as if
probationary employees. Had the administrative law judge concluded that categorically
funded Respondents were probationary, they would have been entitled to the hearing that
was had and in which they participated.

8.

A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a
continuing position that he/she is certificated and competent to fill. In doing so, the senior
employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that position. (Lacy vs.
Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469.)

9.

The District has the discretion to determine whether teachers are certificated
and competent to hold the position for which said teachers have been skipped and retained.
(King v. Berkeley Unified School District (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 1016) Junior teachers may
be given retention priority over senior teachers if the junior teachers possess superior skills or
capabilities that their more senior counterparts lack. (Poppers v. Tamalpais Union High
School District (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 399; Santa Clara Federation of Teachers, Local 2393
v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified School District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831).

10.

The District established cause to not reemploy Respondents for the ensuing

school year and Respondents did not establish facts or sufficient legal argument to the
contrary.

11.

No employee with less seniority than any Respondent is being retained to

perform a service that any Respondent is certificated and competent to render.

8

12.

All arguments not addressed herein are not supported by the evidence and/or

the law and therefore rejected.
