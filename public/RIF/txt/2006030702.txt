Respondents. 

PROPOSED  DECISION 

The  hearing  in  the  above-captioned  matter  was  held  on  April  17,  2006,  at  Oxnard, 

California.  Joseph  D.  Montoya,  Administrative  Law  Judge  (ALJ),  Office  of  Administrative 
Hearings  (OAH),  presided.  Complainant  was  represented  by  James  K.  Lynch  and  Darren  C. 
Kameya,  Burke,  Williams  &  Sorensen,  LLP.  Respondents  were  represented  by  Paul  Powers 
and  Alexis  Ridenour,  Hathaway,  Perrett,  Webster,  Powers,  Chrisman  &  Guitierrez. 

Oral  and  documentary  evidence  was  received  at  the  hearing,  but  the  record  was  held 

open  through  April  19,  2006,  so  that  the  parties  could  obtain  and  review  records  pertaining  to 
Respondent  Donna  Stevens-Payne,  relevant  to  her  first  date  of  paid  service,  and  so  that  the 
seniority  list  could  be  revised  to  conform  with  the  evidence  and  stipulations  received  at  the 
hearing.  Complainant  submitted  a  revised  exhibit  list  on  April  19,  2006,  which  is  received  as 
Ex.  12.  Respondent  also  submitted  a  document  entitled  “Order  of  Layoff  By  Seniority  List 
Number”,  which  is  received  as  Exhibit  13.  The  case  was  deemed  submitted  for  decision  as

The  Administrative  Law  Judge  hereby  makes  his  factual  findings,  legal  conclusions, 

~  of  April  21,  2006.! 

and  orders,  as  follow. 

FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

Complainant  Marc  Jackson  filed  the  accusation’  in  this  proceeding  in  his  official 

capacity  as  Assistant  Superintendent  of  the  Oxnard  School  District  (District). 

  

‘In  the  cover  letter  that  transmitted  Exhibits  12  and  13,  Complainant’s  counsel  represented  that  Respondents’ 
attorney,  Mr.  Powers  had  approved  the  submission,  which  statement  the  ALJ  did  not  doubt.  However,  the  record 
was  held  open  in  the  unlikely  event  that  Respondents’  counsel  had  some  second  thoughts  about  the  documents. 
*  The  term  “accusation”  refers  to  a  type  of  pleading  utilized  under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  Government 
Code  11503.  It  should  be  made  clear  that  the  Respondents  are  not  “accused”  in  the  every-day  sense  of  that  word, 

  

 

2.  The  following  persons  are  certificated  employees  of  the  District: 

Veronica  Augilar,  Sherrill  Asadoor-Waters,  Diane  Barbour,  Kristina  Beers, 

Charlene  Bouvet,  Michelle  Burd,  Patricia  Casiano,  Mirna  Castro,  Julia  Clark,  Linda  De  Los 
Santos,  Raquel  Dominguez,  Cheryl  Dupart,  Wrayna  Fairchild,  Alma  Fernandez,  Christina 
Finney,  Myra  Garcia,  Sandra  Garcia,  Emmanuella  Hadley,  Michele  Harville,  Stephanie 
Kates,  Melissa  LeMay,  Mary  Mickelsen,  Soelia  Mier,  Marina  Miranda,  Gicela  Navarro, 
Morma  Medilskyj,  Patricia  Olsen,  Maria  Belen  Ortiz,  Gregory  Peckham,  Angelica  Raily, 
Arlene  Ruvalcaba,  Julie  Sakamoto,  Stephanie  Schmalhofer,  Brandee  Scogin,  Angela  Smith, 
Donna  Stevens-Payne,  Jose  H.  Torres,  Sylvia  Valencia,  Sharon  Woods,  and  Irene  Zavala. 

3.  On  February  22,  2006,  the  Governing  Board  (Board)  of  the  District  adopted 

resolution  number  05-53,  entitled  “Reduction  of  a  Particular  Kind  of  Service”  (Reduction 
Resolution),  to  reduce  and  discontinue  particular  kinds  of  certificated  services  no  later  than 
the  beginning  of  the  2006-2007  school  year.  Specifically,  the  resolution  requires  the 
reductions  of  42.0  “FTE”—Full  Time  Equivalents—by  reducing  classroom  teaching  in 
elementary  school  grades  kindergarten  through  six.’ 

4,  On  March  8,  2006,  the  Board  adopted  resolution  number  05-54,  entitled 
“Supplemental  Tiebreaking  Criteria  for  Reduction  of  A  Particular  Kind  of  Service”  (Tie- 
breaking  Resolution). 

5.  On  March  13,  2006,  the  Superintendent  of  the  District  recommended  to  the  Board 

that  the  District  give  Respondents,  and  each  of  them,  notice  pursuant  to  Education  Code 
sections  44949  and  44955"  that  Respondents’  services  would  not  be  required  for  the 
following  school  year  (2006-2007).  On  that  same  date,  each  Respondent  was  given  such 
written  notice  that  their  services  would  not  be  required-in  the  2006-2007  school  year 
pursuant  to  sections  44949  and  44955. 

6.  Thirty  of  the  Certificated  Employees  identified  in  Factual  Finding  2  requested  a 
hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  2006-2007  school 
year.  Those  requests  for  hearing  were  timely  filed,  or  the  Board  waived  objection  to  any  late 
filing.  The  following  persons  requested  a  hearing,  and  will  be  collectively  referred  to  as  the 
Respondents: 

Diana  Barbour,  Kristina  Beers,  Charlene  Bouvet,  Michelle  Burd,  Patricia 

Casiano,  Linda  De  Los  Santos,  Raquel  Dominguez,  Alma  Fernandez,  Christina  Finney,  Myra 
Garcia,  Sandra  Garcia,  Emmanuella  Hadley,  Michele  Harville,  Stephanie  Kates, 
Melissa  LeMay,  Mary  Mickelsen,  Soelia  Mier,  Marina  Miranda,  Gicela  Navarro, 

  

unless  it  can  be  said  they  are  accused  of  not  having  enough  seniority  to  retain  their  positions  with  the  District  in  the 
face  of  a  resolution  to  reduce  positions. 
3  The  District  had  also  determined  to  eliminate  11  FTE  in  the  middle  schools,  but  determined  thereafter  that  no 
layoffs  would  take  place,  because  some  employees  had  been  lost  to  attrition  or  other  factors. 
*  All  further  statutory  references  are  to  the  Education  Code  unless  otherwise  noted.

Morma  Medilskyj,  Maria  Belen  Ortiz,  Angelica  Raily,  Arlene  Ruvalcaba,  Julie  Sakamoto, 
Brandee  Scoggin,  Donna  Stevens-Payne,  Jose  H.  Torres,  Sylvia  Valencia,  Sharon  Woods, 
Irene  Zavala. 

7.  Thereafter,  an  Accusation  was  served  upon  each  of  the  Respondents,  and  those 

Respondents  filed  a  notice  of  defense,  which  was  timely,  or  accepted  by  the  District  without 
objection.  All  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met. 

8. 

(A)  The  District  has  undergone  a  decline  in  enrollment  in  the  grades 

kindergarten  through  6  during  the  past  two  years.  Although  total  enrollment  in  the  District  is 
approximately  15,200  students,  during  the  past  two  years  enrollment  has  declined  by  over 
800  students,  or  approximately  5  percent  of  the  total.  As a  result,  the  District  will  require 
fewer  teachers  in  the  2006-2007  school  years  than  it  has  in  prior  years,  because  it  will  have 
fewer  kindergarten  through  sixth  grade  classrooms,  and  it  is  reasonably  inferred  that  the 
District  will  experience  a  decline  in  funding  in  the  next  school  year,  or  thereafter,  due  to  the 
decline  in  enrollment. 

(B)  The  services  which  the  District  seeks  to  discontinue  or  reduce  are 
particular  kinds  of  services  that  may  be  reduced  or  discontinued  under  section  44955. 

9.  The  decision  by  the  Board  to  reduce  or  discontinue  services  was  neither  arbitrary 
nor  capricious,  but  rather  was  a  proper  exercise  of  the  District’s  discretion  given  the  decline 
in  enrollment,  other  factors  considered  by  the  Board,  and  the  manner  in  which  the  decision  to 
reduce  or  discontinue  services  was  reached. 

10.  The  reduction  and  discontinuation  of  services  is  related  to  the  welfare  of  the 

District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated 
employees  as  determined  by  the  Board. 

(A)  In  the  course  of  the  reduction  in  force  process,  the  District  created  a 

seniority  list,  with  the  most  junior  teacher  ranked  number  one  on  that  list.  One  seniority  list 
pertained  to  teachers  in  the  kindergarten  through  sixth  grades,  and  a  separate  list  pertained  to 
middle  school  teachers.  That  seniority  list  took  into  account  a  number  of  factors,  including 
first  date  of  paid  service,  credential  types,  whether  the  teacher  was  eligible  to  be  skipped,  and 
various  tie-breaking  criteria  that  were  developed  by  the  District. 

(B)  In  the  course  of  the  hearing,  further  information  was  developed  which 
caused  an  alteration  to  the  seniority  list,  by  stipulation  of  the  parties.  Thus,  for  example, 
during  the  hearing  it  was  determined  that  Respondent  Kates’  position  on  the  seniority  list 
should  change  from  number  8a  to  8c,  making  her  more  senior  to  Respondents  Dupart  and 
Bouvet,  because  of  the  application  of  tie  breaking  criterion  number  |  from  the  supplemental 
tiebreaking  resolution. 

(C)  As  noted  in  the  preamble,  the  record  had  been  held  open  so  that  District 
could  evaluate  any  evidence  in  the  possession  of  Respondent  Stevens-Payne  as  to  her  first 

-

paid  date  of  service.  Thereafter,  the  District  submitted  the  final  seniority  list,  Exhibit  12. 
Based  on  that  final  seniority  list,  it  has  been  established  that  Respondent  Stevens-Payne  is 
senior  to  all  the  other  Respondents,  and  is  senior  to  three  teachers  who  did  not  receive 
notices. 
teachers  who  are  junior  to  her.” 

Therefore,  she  is  not  subject  to  termination,  as  to  terminate  her  would  be  to  retain 

12. 

(A)  The  District  reviewed  its  records  and  the  seniority  list  to  determine  which 
employees  might  “bump”  other  employees,  because  they  held  credentials  in  another  area  and 
were  entitled  to  displace  a  more  junior  employee.  Likewise,  the  District  determined  that 
certain  junior  teachers  possessed  superior  skills,  training,  or  capabilities  which  more  senior 
teachers  did  not  possess,  which  would  allow  the  more  junior  teachers  to  be  retained  or 
“skipped.” 

(B)  It  was  established  that  Alma  Fernandez,  who  was  teaching  Language  Arts 
and  Flex  Reading  at  Haydock,  was  subject  to  being  bumped  by  the  most  senior  kindergarten 
through  sixth  teacher  who  was  willing  to  take  that  assignment. 

(C)  Patricia  Casiano,  teaching  Language  Arts  EL  3  at  Fremont,  was  bumped 

by  Respondent  Myra  Garcia. 

(D)  Gregory  Packham,  teaching  Language  Arts  at  Haydock,  was  subject  to 

being  bumped  by  Julie  Sakamoto. 

(E)  It  was  determined  that  if  Ms.  Sakamoto  or  Ms.  Garcia  would  accept  being 

laid  off  rather  than  taking  the  positions  held  by  Casiano  or  Packham,  then  Respondents 
Casiano  or  Packham  would  be  bumped  by  Brandee  Scogin. 

(F)  No  other  Respondents  showed  that  they  could  bump  a  more  senior 

teacher. 

. 

(G)  Five  teachers  were  entitled  to  be  skipped:  Jacqueline  Galindo,  Janine 

Klingman,  Maybellyne  Fraser,  Nancy  Booth,  and  Kay  Barmore,  as  all  of  them  hold  special 
education  credentials,  and  the  District  has  a  shortage  of  teachers  credentialed  to  provide 
special  education  services.  ‘These  teachers  do  not  have  emergency  credentials. 

13.  The  District  established  tie-breaking  criteria  in  its  resolutions.  That  criteria  was 

applied  to  break  ties  among  those  teachers  who  shared  the  same  seniority,  such  as  (but  not 
limited  to)  Respondents  De  Los  Santos,  Barbour,  Ortiz,  and  Nedilskys. 
The  tie-breaking 
criteria  were  appropriately  applied  to  the  teachers  listed  on  the  final  seniority  list. 

© 

14.  No  certificated  employee  junior  to  any  Respondent  was  retained  by  the  District  to 

render  a  service  for  which  a  Respondent  was  certificated  and  qualified  to  render. 

  

*  She  is  now  number  26  on  the  seniority  list,  and  position  number  21  is  shown  on  Exhibit  13  as  the  last  position  to  be 
eliminated.

  

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1.  Jurisdiction  was  established  to  proceed  in  this  matter,  pursuant  to  Code  sections  | 

44949  and  44955,  based  on  Factual  Findings  1  through  7. 

2. 

(A)  A  District  may  reduce  a  particular  kind  of  services  (PKS)  within  the 
meaning  of  section  44955,  subdivision  (b),  “either  by  determining  that  a  certain  type  of 
service  to  students  shall  not,  thereafter,  be  performed  at  all  by  anyone,  or  it  may  ‘reduce 
services’  by  determining  that  proffered  services  shall  be  reduced  in  extent  because  fewer 
employees  are  made  available  to  deal  with  the  pupils  involved.”  (Rutherford  v.  Board  of 
Trustees  (1976)  64  Cal.App.3d  167,  178-179.)  More  recently,  the  Court  of  Appeal  made 
clear  that  a  PKS  reduction  does  not  have  to  lead  to  less  classrooms  or  classes;  laying  off 
some  teachers  amounts  to  a  proper  reduction.  (Zalec  v.  Governing  Bd.  of Ferndale  Unified 
School  Dist.  (2002)  98  Cal.App.4th  838,  853-854.  See  also  San  Jose  Teachers  Assn.  v.  Allen 
(1983)  144  Cal.App.3d  627,  631,  637  [Reduction  of  classroom  teaching  can  be  a  reduction  of 
a  PKS;  as  long  as  there  is  a  change  in  the  method  of  teaching  or  in  a  particular  kind  of 
service  in  teaching  a  particular  subject  any  amount  in  excess  of  the  statutory  minimum  may 
be  reduced];  California  Teachers  Assn.  v.  Board  of  Trustees  (1982)  132  Cal.App.3d  32.) 

(B)  The  services  to  be  discontinued  are  particular  kinds  of  services  within  the 

meaning  of  section  44955.  The  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  identified 
services  was  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  and  was  a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion. 
Cause  for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the 
District's  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949.  This 
Conclusion  is  based  on  Factual  Findings  8(A)  through  10,  and  the  foregoing  authorities. 

(C)  Respondents  argued  that  the  District  had  not  shown a  decline  in  the 

average  daily  attendance  (ADA),  and  therefore  could  not  proceed  with  a  reduction  in  force. 
That  argument  is  rejected.  A  decline  in  ADA  is  a  ground  for  reducing  staff  under  section 
44955,  subdivision  (b),  but  not  the  only  ground.  That  statute  also  lists  as  a  ground  for 
termination  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  a  particular  kind  of  service.  Here  the  resolution, 
the  notices,  and  the  accusation  made  clear  that  the  District  was  reducing  or  discontinuing  a 
particular  kind  of  service. 

3. 

(A)  A  senior  teacher  whose  position  is  discontinued  has  the  right  to  transfer  to 

a  continuing  position  which  he  or  she  is  certificated  to  fill.  In  doing  so,  the  senior  employee 
may  displace  or  “bump”  a  junior  employee  who  is  filling  that  position.  (Lacy  v.  Richmond 
Unified  School  District  (1975)  13  Cal.3d  469.)  Junior  teachers  may  be  given  retention 
priority  over  senior  teachers—may  “skip”  that  senior  employee—if  the  junior  teacher 
possesses  superior  skills  or  capabilities  not  possessed  by  their  more  senior  colleagues. 
(Poppers  v.  Tamalpais  Union  High  School  District  (1986)  184  Cal.App.3d  399;  Santa  Clara 
Federation  of  Teachers,  Local  2393  v.  Governing  Bd.  of Santa  Clara  Unified  School  Dist. 
(1981)  116  Cal.App.3d  831.)

(B)  No  Respondent  established  at  the  hearing  that  they  had  the  right  to  bump 

a junior  employee,  although  the  District  established  that  Respondents  Myra  Garcia,  Julie 
Sakamoto,  and  the  most  senior  kindergarten  through  sixth  grade  teacher  could  bump  other 
teachers,  and  that  Respondent  Scogin  might  bump  others  as  well,  as  set  forth  in  Factual 
Findings  12(B)  through  (F). 

(C)  The  District  properly  skipped  five  employees  based  on  their 

qualifications,  those  employees  being  Respondents  Galindo,  Klingman,  Fraser,  Booth,  and 
Barmore.  No  other  Respondent  established  the  right  to  displace  or  “skip”  a  senior  employee. 
This  Conclusion  is  based  on  Factual  Findings  12(A)  and  12(G). 

4.  No  junior  certificated  employee  is  scheduled  to  be  retained  to  perform  services 

which  a  more  senior  employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render,  based  on  Factual 
Finding  11(A)  through  14. 

1.  The  Accusations  are  sustained,  except  as  set  forth  hereafter. 

ORDER 

2.  Notice  shall  be  given  to  employees  occupying  full-time  equivalent  certificated 

positions  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2004-2005  school  year  because  of  the 
reduction  and  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of  services,  as  identified  in  Finding  2,  with 
the  exception  of  Respondent  Donna  Stevens-Payne;  the  teachers  who  are  to  be  skipped, 
identified  in  Finding  12(G);  and  those  teachers  who  may  bump  another  teacher,  identified  in 
Findings  12(B)  through  12(E). 

3.  Notice  shall  be  given  to  Respondents  in  inverse  order  of  seniority  based  on  the 
final  seniority  list  and  list  of  order  of  layoff,  established  by  the  District  in  this  proceeding, 
and  attached  hereto  as  Attachment  number  1.
