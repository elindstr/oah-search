employees.

3.

The 99 respondents1 slated for potential layoff are certificated District

On March 3, 2011, the District’s Governing Board (Board) adopted

Resolution No. 11-442, determining that it would be necessary to reduce or
discontinue particular kinds of services at the end of the current school year. The
Board determined that the particular kinds of services that must be reduced for the

76.11

The services listed above are particular kinds of services, which may be

reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.

1 72 respondents were served with lay off notices and 27 were served with
“precautionary” layoff notices.

2 The original resolution called for a 103.11 FTE reduction. Ultimately, the Board
amended the resolution reducing the FTE cuts to the 76.11 listed herein.

4.

The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the services listed in
Finding 3, above, is neither arbitrary nor capricious; rather, it is due to substantial
decreases in the operating budget, and is, therefore, a proper exercise of the Board’s
discretion. The reduction and discontinuation of services is related to the welfare of
the District and its pupils, and it has become necessary to decrease the number of
certificated employees as determined by the Board. No particular kinds of services
were lowered to levels less than those levels mandated by state or federal law.

5.

The Superintendent and District considered all positively assured

attrition, including resignations, retirements and requests for transfer, in determining
the actual number of necessary layoff notices to be delivered to its employees.

6.

On March 11, 2011, the Superintendent timely notified all respondents

listed in Appendix “A”, except for Heather Sieger (Sieger), pursuant to California
Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, of the District’s intent not to reemploy
them for the upcoming school year. Accordingly, except for Sieger, respondents
received written notice, on or before March 15, 2011, notifying them that the Board
had recommended they not be re-employed in the upcoming, 2011-2012 school year.

7.

On March 11, 2011, except for Sieger3, the respondents listed in

Appendix “A” were properly served with a copy of the Accusation, a blank Notice of
Defense, a Notice of Hearing and other related materials.

8.

Of the 99 respondents served with layoff notices and “precautionary”

layoff notices, 70 respondents timely requested a hearing, 11 respondents did not
timely request a hearing, and 18 respondents failed to request a hearing. The instant
hearing for the 70 respondents who timely requested a hearing ensued.

9.

All of the respondents were properly noticed of the date, time and place

of the instant hearing.

10.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.

11.

Respondents have been selected for notice of layoff pursuant to their
seniority date, which is based on the first day of paid service of each respondent in a
probationary position. Respondents were ranked for layoff in the inverse order of
their seniority dates.

12.

The uncontested testimony of the Coordinator for Human Resources,
Susan Reed, established that two teachers, Victoria Sexton and Idalia Smith should
appear on the “regular RIF list, not the precautionary list.” Those names have been
added to Appendix “B.”

3 The District dismissed the Accusation as to Sieger during the hearing.

ISSUES RAISED DURING THE HEARING

13.

Respondent Michael Walling (Walling) testified that he believes he has

the qualifications to teach English and Geography because he taught English and
Geography at “Options for You.” Therefore, he should be able to “bump” less senior
teachers in areas where his English and Geography teaching experience allow. In
pertinent part, the “competency” criteria established by the Board for purposes of
bumping require “one year of full-time experience in the relevant subject matter area.
Walling’s English and Geography teaching experience is not reflected in his
personnel file and Walling failed to notify the District of that experience in a pre-
layoff “Verification of Personnel Information” form he signed on January 18, 2011.
The form informed Walling, “In the event of a layoff, the foregoing information may
be used by the District to determine which employees are affected.” In the form
Walling checked the “No” answer to the following question: “Have you completed
academic training and one year of full-time experience in another specialized
(subject) area to which the District would be able to assign you?” The District relied
on the information Walling provided in the form in designating teachers for potential
layoff and Walling is now estopped from arguing that his undisclosed English and
Geography teaching experience qualify him to bump a less senior teacher.

14.

Respondent Molly Green (Green) testified that she has student teaching

experience teaching Social Science and that over the past couple years she has
requested to be assigned to teach Social Science. However, due to the need of the
District for French teachers the District has not been able to assign her to teach Social
Science. Consequently, Green does not have the requisite “one year of full-time
experience” teaching Social Science necessary to qualify her to bump into a Social
Science teaching position.

15.

The District has an “Opportunity Program” at Washington High

School, an alternative high school where alternative education programs are provided
to students with social and emotional issues. The Opportunity Program teachers
receive specialized, ongoing/continuous training in the “Boys Town Behavioral
Modification” methodology used to teach the challenging youths participating in the
Opportunity Program. Two respondents, Steven Boone (Boone) and Elizabeth Elliott
(Elliott) testified that they wished to bump into an Opportunity Program position. The
evidence revealed that Boone lacked the necessary one-year experience criterion to
bump into an Opportunity Program position; however, Elliott does possess the
necessary teaching experience. Elliott has been teaching students who have “aged
out” of the District’s Opportunity Program4 at Slover Mountain High School. He has
over two years of full-time teaching of the alternative program at Slover. Elliott has
taught approximately “80 ‘challenging’ students” who “aged out’ of the District’s
Opportunity Program. Consequently, Elliott should have been allowed to bump one of

3 Once youths turn 16 years of age they are transferred out of the Washington
Opportunity Program into a similar program at Slover High School.

4

the less senior Opportunity Program teachers5; thus, the Accusation is dismissed as to
Elliott.

16.

Two School Nurses, respondent Christine Whitmyer (Whitmyer) and
respondent Angela Coaston (Coaston) testified that they were concerned about the
District’s ability to provide necessary nursing services if Nursing Services are cut by
4.0 FTE’s. While their concern is understandable, it is not within the jurisdiction of
the Office of Administrative Hearings to second guess the wisdom of the District’s
choice of programs to cut or eliminate as long as the District can continue to operate
pursuant to Federal and State minimum education requirements. Cutting 4.0 FTE’s
out of the 8.0 FTE’s of Nursing Services provided by the District does not violate any
Federal or State educational requirements and is not fraudulent or so palpably
unreasonable and arbitrary as to indicate an abuse of discretion as a matter of law.
Accordingly, the District’s decision to cut Nursing Services by 4.0 FTE’s was an
appropriate exercise of the District’s discretion.

17.

Respondent Elizabeth Talbert (Talbert) was served with a

precautionary layoff notice and testified that due to her English Language
Development (ELD) teaching experience, if she is chosen for layoff, she should be
allowed to bump a less senior ELD teacher. Talbert teaches in the Opportunity
Program and has a seniority date of 8/23/2004. There is no indication she will be
subjected to layoff in these proceedings or that the District will not allow her to bump
into an ELD position if she is considered for layoff; therefore, her argument is not
ripe for consideration.

18.

Respondent Edrina Fraijo (Fraijo), a Physical Education (PE) teacher

believes she should be allowed to bump into the Athletic Director (AD) position. The
evidence, however, established that the AD position differs from that of a PE teacher
and that Fraijo does not have the requisite one-year experience necessary to bump
into the AD position.

19.

Respondent Shannon Sharp (Sharp) would like to bump into an ELD
assignment; however, the Certificated Employee Coordinator for Human Resources
testified that even if Sharp met the bumping criteria there is no less senior teacher
teaching in an ELD position.

20.

Except for Elliott, no certificated employee junior to any respondent

was retained to perform any services which any respondent was certificated and
competent to render.

4 Elliott testified that she is ready and willing to sign the consent form necessary to
teach the Opportunity Program.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949

and 44955. All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections
were satisfied.

2.

A district may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall
not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by
determining that proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer
employees are made available to deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board
of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 178-179.)

3.

Pursuant to section 44995, a senior teacher whose position is

discontinued has the right to transfer to a continuing position which he or she is
certificated and competent to fill. In doing so, the senior employee may displace or
“bump” a junior employee who is filling that position. (Lacy v. Richmond Unified
School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469

The District has an obligation under section 44955, subdivision (b), to
determine whether any permanent employee whose employment is to be terminated in
an economic layoff possesses the seniority and qualifications which would entitle
him/her to be assigned to another position. (Bledsoe v. Biggs Unified School Dist.,
supra. at 136-137.)

4.

The decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is not

tied in with any statistical computation. It is within the governing authority’s
discretion to determine the amount by which a particular kind of service will be
reduced or discontinued as long as the District does not reduce a service below the
level required by law. (San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627,
635-636.) A school district has wide discretion in setting its budget and a layoff
decision will be upheld unless it was fraudulent or so palpably unreasonable and
arbitrary as to indicate an abuse of discretion as a matter of law. (California Sch.
Employees Assn. v. Pasadena Unified Sch. Dist. (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 318, 322.)

5.

With regard to the well-established doctrine of equitable estoppel, “The

vital principle is that he who by his language or conduct leads another to do what he
would not otherwise have done shall not subject such person to loss or injury by
disappointing the expectations upon which he acted. Such a change of position is
sternly forbidden. It involves fraud and falsehood, and the law abhors both.”
(Seymour v. Oelrichs (1909) 156 Cal. 782, 795, quoted in City of Long Beach v.
Mansell (1970) 3 Cal.3d 462, 488.)

6.

“Generally speaking, four elements must be present in order to apply

the doctrine of equitable estoppel: (1) the party to be estopped must be apprised of the

6

facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon, or must so act that the
party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended; (3) the other
party must be ignorant of the true state of facts; and (4) he must rely upon the conduct
to his injury . . . .” (Driscoll v. City of Los Angeles (1967) 67 Cal.2d 297, 305-306.)

7.

8.

9.

The services listed in Factual Finding 3 are each determined to be a

particular kind of service within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.

Based on the Factual Findings, considered in their entirety, cause exists

to reduce the number of certified employees of the District for budgetary reasons.

Cause to reduce or discontinue services relates solely to the welfare of

the District and its pupils within the meaning of Education Code section 44949.

10.

“Precautionary” respondents Victoria Sexton and Idalia Smith are

added to Appendix “B.”

11.

Cause exits to give all respondents listed in Appendix “B” that their

services are not needed for the ensuing, 2011-2012, school year.

ADVISORY DETERMINATION

The following advisory determination is made:

Prior to May 15, 2011, notice shall be given to the respondents listed in
Appendix “B” that their services will not be required for the ensuing school year due
to the budget deficit and the resulting need to reduce and/or discontinue certain
services.

The Accusation is dismissed as to respondents Heather Sieger and Elizabeth

Elliott and the layoff notices are rescinded.

DATED: April 28, 2011.
