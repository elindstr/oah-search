In the Matter of the Accusation/Non-
Reemployment of Certificated Employees of
the Colfax Elementary School District:

OAH No. 2011031078

Jodi O’Keefe

Respondent.

PROPOSED DECISION

Administrative Law Judge Ann Elizabeth Sarli, Office of Administrative
Hearings (OAH), State of California, heard this matter in Colfax, California, on April
11, 2011.

Terry Filliman, Attorney at Law, represented the Colfax Elementary School

District (District).

Lesley Beth Curtis, Attorney at Law, represented respondent Jodi O’Keefe.

Oral and documentary evidence was presented and the parties offered oral

closing arguments. The matter was submitted for decision on April 11, 2011.

FINDINGS

1.

Fred Adam is the District Superintendent. His actions, and those of the

District’s governing body, the Board of Trustees (Board), were taken solely in their
official capacities.

2.

The District serves approximately 345 students in kindergarten through

8th grade. The District is facing a budget shortfall for the 2011-2012 school year of
at least $464,000.

3.

On March 7, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution No. 11:10/11

(Resolution) reducing or eliminating particular kinds of services (PKS), affecting 5.59
Full Time Equivalent (FTE) certificated positions.

1

4.

The Resolution was based on the Superintendent’s recommendation

that it was necessary to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services no later than
the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year. In making his recommendation, the
Superintendent took into account all positively assured attrition.

5.

The Resolution states that the Board determined that it was necessary to

reduce or eliminate the following PKS of the District not later than the close of the
current school year:

Services

Number of FTE Positions

Physical Education Teaching Services
Kindergarten-8th Grade Teaching Services
Resource Specialist Teaching Services
Administrative Services-Principal
Nursing Services
Total

1.00 FTE
3.00 FTE
.50 FTE
1.00 FTE
.09 FTE
5.59 FTE

6.

As a result of the above PKS reductions and/or eliminations, the Board

determined that it was necessary to decrease 5.59 FTE positions for certificated
employees in the District at the end of the 2010-2011 school year, in accordance with
Education Code section 44955.1

7.

The Resolution directed the Superintendent or his designee to send

appropriate notices to all employees whose services would be terminated by virtue of
the Board’s action.

8.

On March 8 and March 9, 2011, the Superintendent served a letter

(Preliminary Notice) on each of the employees affected by the PKS reductions and/or
eliminations set forth in the Resolution. The Preliminary Notice advised that the
Superintendent had recommended to the Board that the recipient be given preliminary
written notice that his/her services would be terminated at the close of the current
school year due to reductions in PKS.

9.

Jodi O’Keefe timely filed a Request for Hearing to determine whether

there was cause for not reemploying her for the 2011-2012 school year.

10.

On March 28, 2011, the Superintendent made the Accusation and

caused it to be served on Jodi O’Keefe. Ms. O’Keefe timely filed a Notice of
Defense.

1 All statutory references are to the California Education Code unless

otherwise indicated.

2

11. Ms. O’Keefe is a permanent certificated District employee, with a
seniority date of August 19, 2002. She holds a Multiple Subject credential with a
Supplemental Authorization in Math. She is currently assigned to teach the seventh
and eighth grades.

12.

The District is not retaining any junior certificated employee to provide

services in the 2011- 2012 school year, which Ms. O'Keefe is certificated to teach.

13. Ms. O’Keefe maintains that the Board’s decision to reduce 3.0 FTE
Kindergarten-8th Grade Teaching Services (classroom teachers) was arbitrary and
capricious. Ms. O'Keefe maintains that the District Budget Committee recommended
the reduction of only one classroom teaching position and that the Superintendent
originally contemplated only the reduction of 3.0 total certificated teaching positions,
including physical education. This argument is not persuasive. The District Budget
Committee merely makes recommendations, and the Board has no obligation to adopt
its recommendations. The Superintendent’s recommendation to the Board states:
“The Superintendent is recommending that the certificated staffing level be reduced
from 2010-2011 levels by at least 3.0 FTE in order to accommodate recommended
budget reductions.” (Italics added) The Superintendent clearly recommended to the
Board that it reduce a minimum of 3.0 FTE certificated positions. The Board, after
due deliberations, resolved to reduce certificated teaching positions by 4.50 FTE in
order to address the anticipated budgetary shortfall. This decision was not arbitrary
and capricious, but was a well reasoned decision, well within the Board’s authority
and discretion.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

As set forth the Findings, all notice and jurisdictional requirements set
forth in sections 44944 and 44945 were met. The notices sent to respondent indicated
the statutory basis for the reduction of services and, therefore, were sufficiently
detailed to provide her with due process. (San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen
(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627; Santa Clara Federation of Teachers v. Governing Board
(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831.) The description of services to be reduced, both in the
Board Resolution and in the notices, adequately describe particular kinds of services.
(Zalac v. Ferndale USD (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838. See, also, Degener v. Governing
Board (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 689.)

2.

The Governing Board may reduce, discontinue or eliminate a particular

kind of service and then provide the needed services to the students in another
manner. (Gallup v. Board of Trustees (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1571; California
Teachers Association v. Board of Trustees of Goleta Union School Dist. (1982) 132
Cal.App.3d 32.) A school board may reduce services within the meaning of the
statute either by determining that a certain type of service shall not be performed at all
or by reducing the number of district employees who perform such services.

3

(Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 167.)

3.

The services identified in Resolution No. 11:10/11 are particular kinds

of services that may be reduced or discontinued under sections 44949 and 44955.
The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the identified services was neither
arbitrary nor capricious, and was a proper exercise of its discretion. “…[I]t is within
the governing board’s discretion to determine the extent to which any service will be
reduced. (San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 635-636.)
The validity of the board’s decision “‘ is measured by the standard set by reason and
reasonable people, bearing in mind that such a standard may permit a difference of
opinion on the same subject.’” (Campbell Elementary Teachers Assn. v. Abbott
(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 808.)

4.

Cause for the reduction or discontinuance of services relates solely to
the welfare of the District’s schools and pupils within the meaning of section 44949.

5.

No employee junior to respondent is being retained to perform the

services which respondent is certificated to render.

RECOMMENDATION

The District may give notice to respondent that it will not require her services

for the 2011-2012 school year.
