At  the  hearing,  respondents  Deborah  L.  Miller,  Washawn  Bobrow,  Donna 

The  District  and  respondent  Linda  Mowery  agreed  that  Ms.  Mowery’s 

Aarons,  and  Mary  Pat  Armknecht  withdrew  their  requests  for  a  hearing,  and  acknowledged 
that  the  District  may,  therefore,  issue  final  layoff  notices  to  them. 

seniority  date  shall  be  corrected  from  July  29,  2005,  to  July  18,  2005.  Upon  the  correction  of 
her  seniority  date,  Ms.  Mowery  withdrew  her  request  for  a  hearing,  and  acknowledged  that 
she  was  not  contesting  her  layoff. 

remaining  unrepresented  respondents  are  the  certificated  employees  listed  on  Attachment  B 
to  Attachment  1,  who  do  not  have  an  “X”  in  the  column  under  the  heading  “Rep.  By 
Driscoll.”  The  District  properly  and  timely  served  these  unrepresented  respondents  with  all 
notices  required  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.'  In  addition,  the  District 
served  upon  these  unrepresented  respondents  an  Order  Re:  Hearing,  issued  on  April  15, 
2010,  which  notified  them  that  the  hearing  would  begin  at  3:30  p.m.  on  Thursday,  April  29, 
2010,  and  that  their  failure  to  attend  the  hearing  at  that  time  may  constitute  a  waiver  of  their 
right  to  contest  their  layoff,  and  result  in  a  default  under  Government  Code  section  11520. 
Because  these  unrepresented  respondents  did  not  appear  at  the  hearing  on  April  29,  2010, 
this  matter  proceeded  as  a  default  against  them  under  Government  Code  section  11520. 

Simpson’s  seniority  date  shall  be  corrected  from  July  27,  2006,  to  August  16,  2005,  and  that 
Mr.  Simpson  is  a  permanent  certificated  employee  of  the  District.  Upon  correction  of  his 
seniority  date  and  recognition  of  his  permanent  status,  Mr.  Simpson  withdrew  his  request  for 
a  hearing,  and  acknowledged  that  the  District  may,  therefore,  issue  a  final  layoff  notice  to 
him. 

  
   

Respondent  Laura  Estes  is  a  counselor  who  has  been  classified  by  the  District 
as  a  “probationary  0”  employee.  At  the  hearing,  Ms.  Estes  executed  a  Stipulation  Regarding 
Jurisdiction  and  Procedure,  pursuant  to  which  she  agreed  that  the  Governing  Board  (Board)

of  the  District  adopted  Resolution  No.  2010-11  (PKS  Resolution)  on  February  16,  2010, 
which  reduced  or  discontinued  particular  kinds  of  services  at  the  end  of  the  2009-2010 
school  year,  as  set  forth  in  Attachment  A  to  Attachment  1.  The  Stipulation  also  provided  that 
Ms.  Estes  was  timely  served  with  a  preliminary  layoff  notice,  an  Accusation,  and  all  other 
necessary  jurisdictional  documents.  The  Stipulation  provided  further  that  this  layoff 
proceeding  is  based  solely  on  the  grounds  set  forth  in  sections  44949  and  44955,  and  in  no 
way  relates  to  any  certificated  employee’s  ability  or  performance. 

10. 

Ms.  Estes  holds  a  clear  Pupil  Personnel  Services  credential.  She  was  hired  on 

July  16,  2007,  as  a  temporary  employee  for  a  supplemental  counseling  program  created 
under  AB  1802.  This  AB  1802  program  was a  categorically-funded  program,  as  described  in 
section  44909,”  Ms.  Estes  began  her  employment  as  a  counselor  with  the  District  at  the 
Ronald  E.  McNair  High  School. 

11. 

Ms.  Estes  was  laid  off  at  the  end  of  the  2007-2008  school  year,  but  she  was 

rehired  in  July  2009.  She  was  laid  off  again  at  the  end  of  the  2008-2009  school  year,  but  she 
was  rehired  for  the  2009-2010  school  year,  and  was  assigned  as  a  counselor  in  District 
elementary  schools.  Ms.  Estes’s  current  position  is  funded  through  Title  I,  which  makes  her 
position  a  categorically-funded  position  under  section  44909.  According  to  evidence 
presented  by  the  District,  Ms.  Estes’s  categorically-funded  program  is  being  eliminated. 

12.  |  Michelle  Abinsay  was  hired'as  a  counselor  for  the  District  on  July  19,  2007. 

Like  Ms.  Estes,  Ms.  Abinsay  was  hired  into  a  categorically-funded  program  and  began 
working  for  the  District  at  the  Ronald  E.  McNair  High  School.  Ms.  Abinsay  was  also  laid 
off  after  the  2008-2009  school  year,  was  rehired  for  the  2009-2010  school  year,  and  was 
assigned  as  a  counselor  in  District  elementary  schools. 

13. 

In  or  about  the  2007-2008  school  year,  another  counselor  at  the  elementary 

school  where  Ms.  Abinsay  was  located  retired.  That  counselor’s  position  was  designated  as 
a  General  Fund  position.  The  principal  of  that  elementary  school.redesignated  Ms. 

  

?  Section  44909,  in  relevant  part,  provides: 

The  governing  board  of  any  school  district  may  employ  persons  possessing  an 
appropriate  credential  as  certificated  employees  in  programs  and  projects  to  perform 
services  conducted  under  contract  with  public  or  private  agencies,  or  categorically  funded 
projects  which  are  not  required  by  federal  or  state  statutes.  The  terms  and  conditions 
under  which  such  persons  are  employed  shall  be  mutually  agreed  upon  by  the  employee 
and  the  governing  board  and  such  agreement  shall  be  reduced  to  writing.  Service 
pursuant  to  this  section  shall  not  be  included  in  computing  the  service  required  as  a 
prerequisite  to  attainment  of,  or  eligibility  to,  classification  as  a  permanent  employee 
unless  (1)  such  person  has  served  pursuant  to  this  section  for  at  least  75  percent  of  the 
number  of  days  the  regular  schools  of  the  district  by  which  he  is  employed  are 
maintained  and  (2)  such  person  is  subsequently  employed  as  a  probationary  employee  in 
a  position  requiring  certification  qualifications.  Such  persons  may  be  employed  for 
periods  which  are  less  than  a  full  school  year  and  may  be  terminated  at  the  expiration  of 
the  contract  or  specially  funded  project  without  regard  to  other  requirements  of  this  code 
respecting  the  termination  of  probationary  or  permanent  employees  other  than  Section 
44918, 

  

 

  

  

Abinsay’s  position  as  a  position  funded  through  the  General  Fund.  As  a  result  of  this 
redesignation  of  Ms.  Abinsay’s  position,  Ms.  Abinsay  is  now  classified  as  a  permanent 
certificated  employee,  as  reflected  on  the  2009-2010  seniority  list.  Ms.  Abinsay  did  not 
receive  a  preliminary  layoff  notice. 

14. 

At  the  hearing,  Ms.  Estes  asserted  that  the  redesignation  of  Ms.  Abinsay’s  — 

position  violated  the  collective  bargaining  agreement,  which,  in  relevant  part,  provides: 

I 

Process  to  Fill  Site-Based  Positions  Vacated  Mid-Year 

1. 

If  a  site-based  position  is  vacated  or  becomes 
available  after  the  close  of  the  transfer  process 
(hereinafter  “position”),  the  District  shall 
immediately  give  notice  of  the  availability  of  the 
position  to  unit  members  by  posting  a  notice  on 
the  job-line,  sending  the  notice  to  the  Association 
president  and  vice-president,  and  posting  the 
notice  at  central  bulletin  boards  or  prominent 
locations  reasonably  calculated  to  give  notice  to 
unit  members  at  all  school  sites  and  the  Education 
Support  Center.  Unit  members  shall  have  at  least 
seven  (7)  working  days  from  date  of job-line 
posting  to  notify  the  Certificated  Personnel 
Department  of  their  interest  in  the  position. 

15. 

Ms.  Estes  argued  that  the  District  violated  the  procedures  set  forth  in.the 

collective  bargaining  agreement  by  redesignating  Ms.  Abinsay’s  position  as  a  General  Find 
position  without  first  posting  the  vacated  position  as  available  to  other  members  of  the 
bargaining  unit.  According  to  Ms.  Estes,  due  to  this  alleged  violation  of  the  collective 
bargaining  agreement,  because  she  was  hired  before  Ms.  Abinsay,  she  should  be  classified  as 
a  permanent  employee  and  her  preliminary  layoff  notice  should  be  rescinded.  The  District 
disputed  that  it  had  violated  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  by  not  posting  the  vacated 
position  before  redesignating  Ms.  Abinsay’s  position. 

16.  |  Whether  the  District’s  actions  in  redesignating  Ms.  Abinsay’s  position  may 

have  violated  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  is  an  issue  that  is  outside  the  jurisdiction  of 
this  proceeding.  Because  Ms.  Estes  has  at  all  times  been  employed  by  the  District  in  a 
categorically-funded  program,  she  did  not  establish  that  she  should  be  reclassified  from  a 
“probationary  0”  to  a  permanent  employee.  She  did  not  show  that  the  Board  acted  arbitrarily 
or  capriciously,  or  abused  its  discretion  in  reducing  counselors.or  in  issuing  a  preliminary 
layoff  notice  to  her.  Consequently,  she  did  not  establish  that  her  preliminary  layoff  notice 
should  be  rescinded  or  that  she  should  be  reclassified  as  permanent. 

  

 

  

17.  |  There  was  no  evidence  that  the  District  proposes  to  eliminate  any  services  that 

are  mandated  by  state  or  federal  laws  or  regulations. 

18. 

Any  other  assertions  put  forth  by  any  unrepresented  respondents  at  the  hearing 

and  not  addressed  above  are  found  to  be  without  merit  and  are  rejected. 

19,  |  There  was  no  evidence  that  any  junior  employees  are  being  retained  to  render 

services  that  more  senior  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  perform. 

20. 

The  District’s  reductions  and  eliminations  of  particular  kinds  of  services  relate 

solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District’s  schools  and  pupils. 

_  LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

The District  complied  with  all  notice  and  jurisdictional  requirements  set  forth 

in  sections  44949  and  44955. 

2. 

The  services  identified  in  the  PKS  Resolution  are  particular  kinds  of  services 
that  may  be  reduced  or  eliminated  under  section  44955.  The  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or 
eliminate  the  identified  services  was  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  and  was  a  proper 
exercise  of  its  discretion.  Cause  for  the  reduction  or  elimination  of  services  relates  solely  to  the 
welfare  of  the  District’s  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  section  44949, 

3. 

Cause  exists  to  reduce  certificated  employees  of  the  District  due  to  the 

reduction  or  elimination  of  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  District  properly  identified  the 
certificated  employees  to  be  laid  off  as  directed  by  the  Board. 

4, 

No  junior  certificated  employee  is  scheduled  to  be  retained  to  perform  services 

that  a  more  senior  respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

5. 

Cause  exists  to  give  notice  to  the  represented  respondents  consistent  with  their 

stipulations  with  the  District  as  set  forth  in  Attachment  1,  and  to  the  unrepresented 
respondents,  other  than  respondents  David  Wax  and  Mary  Ann  Jacobson,  that  their  services 
will  be  reduced  or  will  not  be  required  for  the  2010-2011  school  year  because  of  the 
reduction  or  elimination  of  particular  kinds  of  services.

Teacher  Respondents  with  regard  to  establishing  appropriate  seniority  dates  or

parties. 

All  issues  pertaining  to  classification  status  and/or  seniority  dates  of  Teacher 
Respondents  have  been  resolved  finally  such  that  Teacher  Respondents  waive  and
