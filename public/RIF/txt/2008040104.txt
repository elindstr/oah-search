FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

2. 

Superintendent  Lara  filed  the  Accusation  in  his  official  capacity. 

Respondents  are  certificated  employees  of  the  District. 

 

  

  

3. 

On  March  11,  2008,  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  District  (Governing  Board) 
adopted  Resolution  number  2007/2008-15,  reducing  K-6  Elementary  School  Classroom 
Teaching  services  by  6  full-time  equivalent  positions  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

4. 

Superintendent  Lara  notified  the  Governing  Board  that  he  had  recommended  that 
notice  be  provided  to  Respondents  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009 
school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services. 

5. 

On  March  12,  2008,  the  District  provided  notice  to  Respondents  that  their 
services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of  particular 
kinds  of  services. 

6. 

Respondents  thereafter  timely  requested  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause 

for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

On  March  14,  2008,  the  District  issued  the  Accusation,  and  thereafter  served  it 

7. 
on  Respondents. 

8. 

9. 

Respondents  thereafter,  through  counsel,  timely  filed  notices  of  defense. 

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met. 

10. 

The  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number 3  are  particular  kinds  of  services 

which  may  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955.! 

12. 

ll. 

The  Governing  Board  took  action  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  services  set  forth 
in  factual  finding  number  3  primarily  because  of  the  uncertainty  surrounding  future  funding. 
The  District  estimates  a  revenue  shortfall  of  approximately  $735,000  for  the  2008-2009  school 
year.  The  decision  to  reduce  the  particular  kinds  of  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious 
but  is  rather  a  proper  exercise  of  the  District's  discretion. 

The  reduction  of  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number  3 is  related  to  the 
welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of 
certificated  employees  as  determined  by  the  Governing  Board. 

"  All  further  references  are  to  the  Education  Code.     

  

13. 

The  District  retained  six  employees  junior  to  some  of  the  Respondents.  Jessie 
Oster,  who  first  rendered  paid  service  as  a  probationary  employee  on  February  13,  2007,  was 
retained  because  she  holds  a  credential  that  allows  her  to  perform  services  as  a  school  nurse. 
Rebecca  Geisler  and  Julee  Gay,  who  have  seniority  dates  of  August  11,  2006  and  August  13, 
2004,  respectively,  were  retained  to  render  special  education  services  and  hold  credentials  that 
enable  them  to  teach  the  classes.  Jeffrey  Madrigal,  hired  on  August  1,  2006,  holds  a  preliminary 
administrative  credential  and  works  as  a  school  principal.  Desiree  Dellinger  and  Lynda  Schiff, 
who  have  seniority  dates  of  August  13,  2004  and  August  15,  2003,  respectively,  were  retained 
to  continue  teaching  in  the  Districtâ€™s  middle  school;  they  each  have  credentials  that  allow  them 
to  teach  single  subjects,  English  and  Social  Studies,  respectively.  Respondents  do  not  possess 
the  credentials  that  would  allow  them  to  provide  the  services  of  the  retained  certificated 
employees.  No  objection  was  raised  to  the  retention  of  any  of  the  six  certificated  employees.  In 
any  event,  retaining  these  six  individuals  is  appropriate  as  the  District  demonstrated  the  specific 
need  for  their  services  and  the  certificated  employees  in  question  have  the  requisite  training  and 
experience  to  provide  the  services. 

14. 

Respondents  all  hold  multiple  subject  credentials. 

They  have  the  following 
seniority  dates:  August  16,  2002  (Velasco  and  Garcia);  August  27,  2002  (Reynoso);  August  15, 
2003  (Mosqueda);  August  13,  2004  (Rosas);  and  August  29,  2005  (Soares). 

15. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  to  any  Respondent  was  retained  to  render  a 

service  which  any  Respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render.
