BEFORE THE 
GOVERNING BOARD OF THE 
SWEETWATER UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 

In the Matter of the Reduction in Force Involving: 

Certain Certificated Employees, Respondents 

OAH No. 2020030202 

PROPOSED DECISION 

Abraham M. Levy, Administrative Law Judge, Office of Administrative Hearings, 

State of California (OAH), heard this matter telephonically on May 27 and 28, 2020, 

from San Diego, California. The hearing was originally scheduled to take place on April 

14 to 16, 2020, at the Sweetwater Union High School District (District). In an order 

dated April 10, 2020, on the joint motion of the parties, the hearing was continued and 

a prehearing conference took place on May 11, 2020, for further scheduling. After the 

prehearing conference, in an order dated May 15, 2020, the hearing was scheduled to 

take place on May 27 to 29, 2020, as a telephonic hearing in light of the Governor’s 

proclamation of a State of Emergency and Executive Orders N-25-20, N-33-20, and N-

63-20 arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Mark Bresee, Attorney at Law, Atkinson, Andelson, Loya, Ruud & Roma, 

represented the Sweetwater Union High School District (District). 

Fern Steiner, Attorney at Law, Smith Steiner Vanderpool, APC, represented 

certain respondents (“represented respondents”). 

1 

Elena Bolanos, Roman Coronado, Sean Hanashiro, Michelle Ivers, Thea Means, 

John Stubbs, Stephanie Rabelo, David Reyes Cornejo, Elizabeth Tran, Saul Yescas, and 

Alfredo Zamora, respondents, represented themselves. 

By agreements of the parties, in lieu of opening and closing statements, the 

parties were given the opportunity to submit closing briefs by 5:00 p.m. on May 29, 

2020. District and represented respondents submitted closing briefs on May 29, 2020, 

which have been marked and made part of the record. On May 29, 2020, the matter 

was submitted. 

FACTUAL FINDINGS 

Jurisdictional Matters 

1. 

On February 24, 2020, Karen Janney, District Superintendent, 

recommended to the District Board of Education (“Board”) that it adopt Resolution No. 

4658, which authorized a reduction in particular kinds of certificated services (PKS) for 

the 2020-2021 school year and directed that respondents be given notice that their 

services will not be required for the 2020-2021 school year. 

2. 

On February 24, 2020, the Board adopted Resolution No. 4658. The 

services identified in Resolution No. 4658 are “particular kinds of services” within the 

meaning of Education Code section 44955(b). 

3. 

In its resolution, the Board identified a reduction in PKS between this 

year and next year equal to 237.71 full-time equivalents (FTEs). Subsequently, the 

number of FTEs proposed for reduction was reduced to a total of 210.13 FTEs. This 

number has been further reduced to 209.13 FTEs based on the District’s decision to 

2 

retain one respondent. (See Appendix A below for list of respondents.) According to 

the following chart, the District has identified the following PKS for reduction both as 

identified in its February resolution and currently:

4. 

As noted, the District withdrew the 1.0 FTE in General Science PKS from 

the layoff, which reduced the total FTEs for reduction to 209.31 and includes the 36.24 

FTEs non-respondents hold. (District’s Closing Brief, p. 1, fn. 1, “Exhibit A” attached to 

District’s brief.) This 1.0 FTE is held by respondent Ebber Nava. After correcting Mr. 

Nava’s seniority date the District decided to retain him. Thus, the total FTE reductions, 

after non-respondent reductions are factored, are 172.89. (Ibid.) 

5. 

The resolution references the competency criteria under Education Code 

sections 44955, 44956, and 44957, for the purposes of bumping and reemployment. It 

also details the tie-breaking criteria for the order of termination to be applied between 

employees sharing the first date of paid probationary service. 

6. 

On or before March 15, 2020, all respondents were served with a Notice 

of Recommendation Not to Reemploy Certificated Employees, which included a notice 

letter, a copy of Resolution No. 4658, a copy of Education Code sections 44949 and 

44955, and a request for hearing form. 

4 

After receiving the Notice of Recommendation Not to Reemploy Certificated 

Employees, the respondents identified in Appendix A timely requested a hearing, in 

writing, to determine if there is cause for not reemploying them for the ensuing year. 

7. 

On or about March 27, 2020, the District served all respondents with a 

Cover letter; a Notice of District Statement of Reduction in Force; a District Statement 

of Reduction in Force; copies of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955; copies of 

Government Code sections 11506, 11507.5, 11507.6, 11507.7 and 11520; and a copy of 

Office of Administrative Hearings General Order, March 19, 2020. 

8. 

As noted, respondents who requested a hearing and who are subject to 

the reduction in force action hold a total of 172.89 FTEs. 

9. 

All jurisdictional requirements under Education Code sections 44949 and 

44955 have been met in order that an evidentiary hearing may commence to 

determine if there is cause for not reemploying the respondents for the 2020-2021 

school year. 

Testimony of District Witnesses and Evidence 

10. 

The District called three witnesses: Jenny Salkeld, Ph.D., Milena Aubry, 

and Thomas Glover, Ph.D. 

11. 

Dr. Salkeld is the District’s Chief Financial Officer and has held this 

position since August 24, 2018. She oversees the District’s restricted and unrestricted 

budgets and other funds and manages the day-to-day operations including payroll. 

12. 

Dr. Salkeld described in detail the District’s dire financial projected fiscal 

situation from 2016 through the present. As documented in three interim budget 

status reports between March 9, 2020 and May 11, 2020, she presented to the Board, 

5 

the District projects a budget shortfall of $31,730,000 for the 2020-2021 school year as 

of March 9, 2020. (Exhibit 2, page 221.)1 

This budget shortfall is due to a variety of factors: declining enrollment, 

increased pension contributions, increased expenses of employees moving on salary 

schedules, and increases in the District’s expenses. Dr. Salkeld stressed that declining 

enrollment is at the top of the list of reasons for the District’s financial situation. Since 

2014, 40,000 fewer students are enrolled in the District. To highlight the degree of the 

District’s declining enrollment, she noted that recently the Chula Vista school district 

expanded its program with the result that it is anticipated that even fewer students will 

be enrolling in the District. 

The District’s financial predicament is not recent. From the prior fiscal year, the 

District has carried over a $3.5 million deficit. The District also has been unable to 

maintain the budget reserve required for economic uncertainty. As a result, the District 

is “negatively certified,” and has to submit reports to a financial advisor in the San 

Diego County Office of Education. 

13. 

Dr. Salkeld also stressed, as she reported to the Board in the May 11, 

2020, third interim report, the District’s financial situation has “gotten very much 

worse” due to revisions in the Governor’s proposed budget relating to reductions in 

the cost of living increase (COLA) that is factored into the local control funding 

                                              

1 This represents an increase from the $30,000,000 projected deficit, as of March 

9, 2020, due to updated student enrollment numbers. (Exhibit 2, page 221.) 

6 

formula. The proposed lowering of the COLA will result in an increase in the budget 

deficit. 

14. 

Due to the District’s dire financial predicament, Dr. Salkeld believes that 

the District’s financial situation requires that layoffs be initiated and they are necessary 

for the welfare of the District’s students and the District. 

15.  Ms. Aubry is the District’s Human Resources Director, a position she has 

held since 2012. Related to the District’s decision to reduce PKS, Ms. Aubry prepared a 

number of documents. These documents are identified as follows: a “Certificated 

Seniority List” (Exhibit 5), “Tie Breaker Documents” (Exhibit 6) relating to employees 

with the July 18, 2016, seniority date, a “Reemployment Tie Breaks” (Exhibit 7) for 

employees with seniority dates other than July 18, 2016, a “Layoff Analysis” report 

(Exhibit 8), “Bumping Charts for PKS Areas” (Exhibit 9), and a list of employees 

proposed to receive final notice of layoff reduction. (Exhibit 10.) 

16. 

Respondents do not challenge the District’s seniority dates, the District’s 

application of the tie-breaking criteria identified in the February 25, 2020, resolution, 

or the District’s layoff analysis in general, except in one instance regarding the 

District’s bumping of Mr. Nava, whose matter will be discussed below. For the most 

part, represented respondents broadly challenge the District’s decision to reduce 

specific categories of PKS. As detailed in represented respondents’ closing brief, they 

question the District’s decision to eliminate all District librarian positions, a number of 

7 

counselors, and a .40 FTE reduction for a “Teacher on Special Assignment Induction” 

and .60 FTE reduction for a Resource Teacher Induction. (Exhibit 4, page 252.)2 

17. 

Dr. Glover is the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources for the 

District. 

Dr. Glover stated that he was “involved in determining” the reduction in PKS as 

documented in the list identified as “Exhibit A,” which the Board incorporated in its 

resolution. The initial list identified 237.71 FTEs in PKS for reduction. For purposes of 

issues respondents raised related to the categories of PKS in this proceeding, the 

District, initially, proposed for reduction of all District librarians, 32 FTEs for Learning 

Center Teachers, 20.40 FTE of counselors, and 1.80 FTE for Resource Teacher Induction 

and 2.40 FTE for a Teacher on Special Assignment Induction. 

18. 

The number of FTEs identified for reduction has been reduced from 

237.71 FTEs to 210.13 FTEs. (Exhibit 4, page 252.)3 This reduction in FTEs identified for 

reduction was due to multiple teachers from the District’s Learning Center with special 

education credentials being retained which reduced the FTEs proposed for elimination 

from 32 to 22. In addition, two librarians with special education credentials are also 

being retained. Also, eight FTEs under the management assistant principal PKS were 

reduced to zero. Dr. Glover stated the eight FTEs Assistant Principal PKS are being 

                                              

their professional skills. 

2 “Induction” refers to the support given to new teachers to help them develop 

3 As discussed earlier, the total FTEs to be reduced are 209.13. After the hearing 

the District withdrew its reduction in force action against Mr. Nava and has retained 

him. Mr. Nava holds a 1.0 FTE in the General Science PKS category. 

8 

retained for the position for “safety reasons.” He explained that the distance learning 

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic requires that, while students distance learn, 

assistant principals be at school sites. 

19. 

Dr. Glover was asked, on cross-examination, who would provide librarian 

services next year. He answered that teachers will bring their students to the libraries 

and supervise them. Principals and vice-principals, as a “management function,” will do 

some of the librarian’s tasks, including preparing “The Williams Report.”4 He added 

that principals and library media technicians can collect library fines. He does not know 

who will teach digital literacy or who will select books for the libraries. 

20. 

Regarding the District’s plan to close its Learning Centers5 and the 

impact these closings will have on students who benefit from its programs, Dr. Glover 

said that students at the Learning Center can choose to return to the campus, continue 

through the “Options” online learning program or the District’s Independent Study 

program. 

21. 

Dr. Glover also addressed the District’s plans with respect to the .40 

Teacher on Special Assignment (TOSA) Induction PKS and .60 Resource Teacher 

Induction PKS positions. In the modified layoff list, the District plans to retain both of 

                                              

4 Dr. Glover was referring to the “Williams Reporting for School Accountability” 

report, which is a report that the District is required to complete regarding the library 

services schools provide. It is discussed in more detail later in this decision. 

5 The District’s Learning Centers provide students with an alternative way to 

meet their educational goals through independent and one-on-one self-paced 

education. 

9 

these positions. Dr. Glover stated that the District does not plan to have induction 

services. But, in anticipation of the layoff, the District “plans” on reassigning the 

persons performing induction services to teaching assignments. The persons holding 

these positions have not been subject to a bumping analysis. 

Corrections to Exhibit 8 by Stipulation of the Parties 

22. 

Before it completed its case, the District made the following corrections 

to the record, which respondents did not oppose, and which are summarized as 

follows:6 

First, at Exhibit 8, page 460, row 362, Mr. Nava’s seniority date was changed to 

July 22, 2015 from July 18, 2016. 

At page 458 of Exhibit 8, Row 316, under the “Status” column, “Layoff: Learning 

Center Teacher – Bumped by Ana Munoz” is changed to read: “Layoff: Learning Center 

Teacher – Bumped by Sylvia McBride.” 

At page 460 of Row 354, also in the “Status” column, “Layoff: Librarian – 

Bumped by Sylvia McBride” is changed to read “Layoff Learning Center Teacher 

bumped by Ana Munoz.” 

                                              

6 At the start of the hearing, the District withdrew its reduction in force action 

against two respondents, Janette Gomez-Lamadrid and Karen Saiki. The District further 

did not oppose Michelle Ivers and Elizabeth Tran appearing in this matter as 

respondents who timely asked to participate in this matter. These changes are 

reflected in Appendix A below. 

10 

At Exhibit 8, page 507, Row 1125, again under the “Status” column, “Librarian: 

Bumps Daniel Arreola” is stricken and replaced with “Librarian: Bumps Crystal Scott.” 

Furthermore, at Exhibit 8, page 565, Row 2078, “Learning Center Teacher: 

Bumps Crystal Scott” is changed to “Learning Center Teacher: Bumps Daniel Arreola.” 

The parties agreed that these corrections do not change the reduction in force 

action. 

Testimony of Respondents 

23. 

The following respondents testified: Janice Gilmore-See, Barbara 

Chappell-Brown, Misael Virgen, Graciela Medina, Jennifer Schafran, Kristina Lopez, 

Stephanie Rabelo, John Stubbs, and Elena Bolanos. In addition, in lieu of his testimony, 

Pedro Fuentez, Jr. submitted a letter, which was marked and made part of the record. 

24.  Ms. Rabelo has been a high school English and Social Studies teacher 

since 2007. She has been employed at Sweetwater Union High School District for the 

last two years with a seniority date of February 27, 2018. The District proposes laying 

her off under the .80 FTE in Social Studies PKS category. (Exhibit 8, page 447.) Ms. 

Rabelo holds a single subject credential in English and Social Science and 

supplementary authorizations in Psychology and Comparative Political Systems and 

International Relations. While at the District, Ms. Rabelo testified she has sometimes 

been assigned teaching assignments using both her single subject credentials for 

different English and Social Science classes. Ms. Rabelo supplemented her testimony 

with an opening statement and documents, which have been admitted and 

considered. (Rabelo Exhibits A to O.) 

11 

Ms. Rabelo asks that her position on the seniority list be changed from #147 to 

#358. As she put it in her opening brief, she asks for this change because she has the 

“ability to uniquely fulfill the District’s need for assigning courses to appropriately 

credentialed teachers.” (Ms. Rabelo’s Opening Statement, page 903 [capitalizations 

removed from original].) In essence, Ms. Rabelo asks that the District deviate from the 

layoff list because she holds multiple single subject credentials and, because of her 

multiple credentials, she is more competent than more senior teachers who hold fewer 

credentials or who have preliminary credentials. In support of her argument, she 

highlighted, using the District’s Layoff Analysis report, numerous teachers with 

preliminary English and Social Science credentials who have been proposed for layoff. 

(Rabelo Exhibit G.) She further highlighted, using the District’s seniority list, teachers 

with clear English and Social Science credentials who are more senior than she is. 

Although her point in highlighting these teachers was not perfectly clear, Ms. Rabelo 

appeared to suggest that her experience and credentials should allow her to be placed 

higher on the seniority list than these teachers. (Rabelo Exhibit F.) 

As the District and represented respondents noted in their closing briefs, Ms. 

Rabelo is asking that the District be compelled to “skip” her above more senior 

teachers pursuant to Education Code section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), based on her 

training and experience and, more specifically, because she holds clear single subject 

credentials in English and Social Science and has had teaching assignments in both 

areas. 

Ms. Rabelo’s argument is not persuasive. Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), gives 

such “skipping” authority to the District, as the District correctly stated in its closing 

brief. The authority to skip over more senior teachers is an exception to the general 

rule that the services of a senior employee must be retained over the services of more 

12 

junior employees. This exception involves “skipping” a junior employee and retaining 

the junior employee’s unique and necessary services over the services of a more senior 

employee who does not have special training and/or experience. (Bledsoe v. Biggs 

(2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 127, 138 and fn. 8.) 

In this matter, the District did not find it needed to use Ms. Rabelo’s specialized 

skills and education as a program requirement and thus retain her by skipping her 

over more senior teachers. Within the scope of this record, thus, it is not proper to 

question the District’s decision to not exercise its authority to allow Ms. Rabelo to skip 

over more senior employees. Presumably, the District knew its program requirements 

and made budgetary decisions consistent with these requirements. At any rate, the 

District’s election to not make such an assessment does not appear arbitrary or 

capricious, to the extent this is a feature of Ms. Rabelo’s argument. The District also 

elected not to exercise its “skipping” authority for numerous other teachers with Ms. 

Rabelo’s same single subject credentials who also have been identified for the layoff. 

(Exhibit 9, page 583.) A number of these teachers are more senior than Ms. Rabelo. 

25.  Ms. Chappell-Brown is employed as a librarian at the District and has a 

seniority date of July 18, 2016. She holds a 1.0 FTE position, which the District has 

proposed for elimination along with all librarians. She holds a clear credential as a 

“Teacher Librarian Services”. 

Ms. Chappell-Brown has a master’s degree in library science. She is “regional 

leader” for the California School Library Association. She stressed the role librarians 

have in promoting literacy, collaborating with teachers to complement their lesson 

plans, and helping ensure that students have access to digital resources. Ms. Chappell-

Brown cited this as especially important given the prevalence of distance learning due 

to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

13 

26.  Ms. Lopez is also a librarian at the District. She has a seniority date of 

September 21, 2009, and she holds a clear credential in library media services. 

Ms. Lopez stressed the important role librarians have in the schools where they 

are assigned. Only librarians, Ms. Lopez stated, can complete the mandatory “Williams 

Reporting for School Accountability,” a report that is required to ensure that all 

students are provided with sufficient instructional materials. They collaborate with 

administrators on master calendars and conduct text book analyses. Librarians are 

experts in teaching curricula; they make sure library collections are in compliance with 

the curricula and they support the curricula. Librarians make sure there are primary 

resources, and library books are cataloged. 

27.  Ms. Gilmore-See holds a 1.0 FTE PKS as a librarian at Chula Vista High 

School (CVHS) and holds a clear credential as a “Teacher Librarian Services”. She has a 

seniority date of April 23, 2018. Ms. Gilmore-See took particular issue with the 

District’s decision to have library technicians and assistant principals perform the 

duties of certificated librarians for the next budget year. To Ms. Gilmore-See, this 

would mean they would be taking over duties only librarians can perform. These duties 

include preparing reports, including the above-mentioned “Williams” report, inventory 

reports, student fine reports, reports regarding different databases, and also looking at 

the master calendars to determine how many texts are needed. Also, librarians are 

required to monitor student behavior while they are in the library. 

28.  Mr. Stubbs holds a clear credential in Social Science and has a seniority 

date of August 7, 2017. Mr. Stubbs supplemented his testimony with a statement 

(“Exhibit 1-John Stubbs-Unrepresented Respondent”, pages 662-665), which was 

received into evidence. 

14 

Mr. Stubbs graduated from the District and would like to return to teach at the 

District. He holds no ill-will against anyone from the District and does not question the 

right of the District to layoff teachers, although he wonders if the District is in fact 

putting students first by its reduction in force action. He asked that consideration be 

given to the current stressful employment environment, and he is concerned what the 

reduction in force will do to students and teachers. Mr. Stubbs further questioned the 

accuracy of the seniority list, although he did not question the accuracy of his seniority 

date, and it was unclear what “inaccuracies” in the seniority list he was alleging. He 

wondered why it is not possible to consider the merits of teachers, as a “metric” for 

continued employment. Mr. Stubbs stated that he was not given enough time to 

prepare for the matter because the full seniority list was not released to him until 

recently. He did not detail how he was prejudiced or make any further argument in this 

regard. 

29.  Ms. Bolanos holds clear credentials in Foundational-Level Math and 

Bilingual, Cross-Cultural, Language and Academic Development (BCLAD), and a 

Spanish and Reading Certificate. In addition to holding a Clear Multiple Subject 

credential, Ms. Bolanos holds a Subject Teaching Credential. She has 20 years of math 

teaching experience. 

Ms. Bolanos has a seniority date of September 17, 2018. Her current assignment 

is to teach Integrated Math-IB at CVHS. She is proposed for layoff as a 1.0 FTE under 

the math PKS category. In addition to her testimony Ms. Bolanos submitted a 

statement, which was submitted into the record and has been considered. (Page 660 

of Unrepresented Respondents Exhibits.) 

Ms. Bolanos believes her work as a bilingual math teacher is vital because she 

works with at-risk/high-need students. Over the two years she has taught at CVHS, she 

15 

has developed a rapport with students who lacked an interest in learning math 

fundamentals and now have moved forward in their high school achievements. 

30.  Ms. Virgen holds preliminary credentials in Social Science and English 

Learner Authorization (ELAS), and in Career Technical Education (CTE)-Arts, Media and 

Entertainment. She has a seniority date of January 16, 2019. Her .56 FTE TOSA-CTE PKS 

position is being bumped by Ricardo Cisneros. Mr. Cisneros has a seniority date of 

August 29, 2005. Ms. Virgen did not challenge Mr. Cisneros’s ability to bump her. 

Ms. Virgen stated that she wanted to express her disagreement with the 

District’s budgetary decision. 

31.  Ms. Medina holds a Clear Pupil Personnel Services (PPS) credential in 

School Counseling and has a seniority date of October 6, 2014. She has a .60 FTE 

assignment. Her .40 FTE position as a Secondary School Counselor is proposed for 

elimination and her .20 FTE appears to being bumped by employee “Tran.” According 

to the District’s seniority list, this person appears to be “Tich Tran”, who has a seniority 

date of August 30, 2007. (Exhibit 5, pages 328 and 473; Exhibit 9, pages 576 and 577.) 

Ms. Medina did not raise an objection to the District’s bumping analysis. 

In her testimony Ms. Medina expressed concern that the welfare of students 

could be affected without counselors available to them, particularly due to the stress 

of isolation. 

32.  Ms. Schafran teaches accelerated English and English in a 1.0 FTE 

position. She holds clear credentials in Social Science and English. Ms. Schafran has a 

seniority date of July 19, 2016. She is proposed for layoff under the TOSA-ELD 

category. (Exhibit 9, 607.) She is being bumped by Dorothea Charles Dickey. (Exhibit 5,

page 459.) Ms. Dickey also has clear credentials in Social Science and English and has a 

seniority date of August 30, 2005. (Exhibit 8, page 514.) 

Ms. Schafran stated that she has been teaching for 10 years and this is the 

seventh time she has been laid-off. She noted that per the District’s website, the 

District is advertising for teaching positions through the “EdJoin” education job 

positing website, for the 2020-2021 school year, including for her position. 

33. 

In addition to the testimony of these teachers, Mr. Fuentez submitted a 

letter which was submitted into the record. (Exhibit C.) Mr. Fuentez holds a clear 

credential in Social Science and has a supplemental BCLAD certification. Mr. Fuentez is 

a resource teacher in Social Science at CVHS where he has taught the last four years 

and holds a 1.0 FTE position. He has a seniority date of October 4, 2016. He is being 

laid-off under the 1.0 FTE Social Science PKS category. At CVHS he stated he works as 

a teacher on temporary assignment (TOSA) as an attendance coordinator. 

Mr. Fuentez stressed his ability to teach courses in English and Spanish and his 

efforts to get students “back on track” so that they can graduate. He noted he is the 

only teacher who teaches in a bilingual setting and does the TOSA attendance. He 

further noted he has made over 100 home visits every year for the last four years as 

attendance coordinator. As a result of his efforts the attendance rate at CVHS 

increased from 88 percent four years ago to 96.7 percent. CVHS’s graduation rate has 

also increased from 86 percent four years ago to 91 percent today. 

34 

These teachers are recognized as dedicated professionals who have 

committed themselves to the profession of teaching and education for the betterment 

of District students and the District as a whole. Their frustration with the District’s 

budgetary situation and consequent reduction in force action is understandable. 

17 

Represented Respondents’ Arguments and Evaluation 

35. 

Represented respondents in their closing brief raised several arguments 

concerning the District’s proposed reduction in force action. These arguments have 

been considered and are addressed in turn as follows: 

36. 

Respondents argue, with respect to the decision to propose for layoff all 

librarians, that the District cannot take this action consistent with the Education Code 

and relevant court decisions. Citing Chambers v. Board of Trustees (1940) 38 

Cal.App.2d 561, respondents argue that the District cannot eliminate all librarian 

positions while it continues to provide the identical kind of service and positions held 

by the terminated librarians. (Post-Hearing Brief of Certain Respondents, p. 6, citing 

Chambers v. Board of Trustees, supra, 38 Cal.App.2d 561, 566.) While recognizing the 

District may choose to continue a PKS in a different manner, the duties of a 

credentialed librarian require that these duties only be performed by librarians. The 

District, as it stated in its closing brief, argues that there is no statutory requirement 

that the District employ librarians. (District’s Closing Brief, at pp. 8 to 9, citing San Jose 

Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, at p. 639 citing Campbell 

Elementary Teachers Assn. Inc. v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 811.) The District, 

further, disputes respondents’ contention that the District plans to continue library 

services in the “identical” manner. 

37. 

Respondents’ argument that the District’s plan to eliminate all librarian 

positions violates the Education Code is rejected. As the District correctly noted, the 

District is not required to employ librarians, and as long as the District is not offering 

the same services performed by the terminated employees, it may eliminate all 

librarian positions. (Campbell Elementary Teachers Assn. Inc., supra, 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 

at pp. 881-812.) And, contrary to respondents’ claim, the District does not plan to offer 

18 

the identical services certificated librarians perform, per Dr. Glover’s testimony. The 

District plans to have teachers and assistant principals supervise students when they 

are brought to the libraries, and principals will perform required reports per their 

management duties. Principals and library media personnel will collect fines. 

38. 

Respondents make a similar argument against the District’s plan to 

reduce counselors and teachers associated with the District’s Learning Center. The 

evidence does not support respondents’ contention that the District plans to offer the 

identical services the terminated employees provide. Dr. Glover testified that students 

at the Learning Center can choose to return to the campus, continue through the 

Options online learning program, or participate in independent study. 

39. 

Respondents also argue that the District failed to make assignments and 

reassignments per Education Code section 44955, subdivision (c). This section requires 

districts to “make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that employees 

shall be retained to render any service which their seniority and qualifications entitle 

them to render.” 

40. 

Respondents first assert here that the District’s failure to assign or 

reassign the .40 TOSA induction PKS and .60 Resource Teacher Induction PKS within 

the layoff process violates Education Code section 44955, subdivision (c). 

Respondents argue that the District must reassign these positions within this 

layoff process in order to comply with Education Code section 44955. Citing the Court 

of Appeal’s decision in Alexander v. Board of Trustees (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 567, 

respondents state, “If the District were seeking to deviate from seniority to retain a 

teacher in a specific course, the District must show that the junior teachers being 

retained will actually be employed in the specific course requiring the special training 

19 

and experience before they may be given preference over more senior teachers 

lacking that special training.” (Post-Hearing Brief of Certain Respondents, p. 8.) The 

Alexander court identified the principle that a district should follow per Education 

Code section 44955 as follows: “Upon determining a need for a reduction in the 

number of permanent employees, a school district is required to comply with the lay-

off procedures enumerated in section 44955.” (Alexander v. Board of Trustees, supra, 

139 Cal.App.3d at p. 570.) 

41. 

Respondents are correct that the District is not applying the proper 

criteria under Education Code section 44955 and is operating outside the layoff 

process for both PKS categories. Dr. Glover, in his testimony, said as much. He stated 

that the District is reserving the teaching assignments for both the .40 TOSA Induction 

PKS and .60 Resource Teacher Induction PKS categories until sometime in the future. 

Because the District is holding off on making assignments or reassignments under 

these two PKS categories, the District is not following the steps under Education Code 

section 44955 for these two categories. As a result, the District may impermissibly 

deviate from the seniority list. 

42. 

To correct this violation of Education Code section 44955, the District will 

be required to follow the layoff process under that section for both PKS categories. 

Within two weeks of the adoption of this decision, the District will identify any 

employee or employees designated for assignment or reassignment under both PKS 

categories based on the seniority list and, as needed, the District will perform the 

appropriate bumping analysis and issue any required notices per Section 44955. If 

necessary, after it performs this analysis, the District will modify the list of employees 

designated to be laid-off. 

20 

43. 

Respondents further assert the District violated Education Code section 

44955 by its decision to layoff Mr. Nava. The District does not oppose respondents’ 

request that the reduction in force action against him be dismissed due to the revision 

to his seniority date and that he be retained. In its closing brief, the District withdrew 

its action against Mr. Nava, based on this revision of his seniority date, and has now 

decided to retain him. (“Exhibit B” attached to District’s Closing Brief.) The District, 

further, in its brief reduced by 1.0 FTE the total FTEs to be reduced to 172.89 FTEs 

based on the District’s retention of Mr. Nava due to the revision in his seniority date. 

(District’s Brief, page 1, fn. 1.) 

44. 

Except as discussed above, the District’s decision to dismiss teachers was 

based solely on the welfare of the District and its students and, also, except as noted, 

no respondent is being terminated while any junior employee is being improperly 

retained. 

Parties’ Arguments 

45. 

The District, in its closing brief, asked that its decision to layoff the 

identified teachers be affirmed. The District selected the appropriate employees to be 

laid-off considering their seniority, assignment, and credentials and the District’s 

decision is necessary. 

46. 

Represented respondents, in their closing brief, in addition to the 

arguments discussed above, asserted that the District’s massive layoff is not in the best 

interest of the students and does not meet their needs. Further, represented 

respondents questioned the District’s assertion that layoffs are necessary given that, as 

Ms. Schafran testified, the District is advertising to fill teaching positions, including the 

position Ms. Schafran holds. Represented respondents hope that the District will 

21 

acknowledge that no one could be hired to be a counselor or to teach a subject in 

which there are teachers or counselors on the layoff recall list. 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to Education Code 

sections 44949 and 44955, and all notices and other requirements of those sections 

were provided as required. A district may reduce services within the meaning of 

section 44955, subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to 

students shall not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce 

services’ by determining that proffered services shall be reduced in extent because 

fewer employees are made available to deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. 

Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 178-179.) School districts have the 

discretion to determine particular kinds of services that will be eliminated, even 

though a service continues to be performed or provided in a different manner by the 

district. (Hildebrandt v. St. Helena Unified School Dist. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 334, 

343.) A school district’s decision to reduce a particular kind of service must not be 

fraudulent, arbitrary or capricious. (San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal. 

App. 3d 627, 637.) 

Education Code. 

The District has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence in this 

matter to show that its decision to reduce or discontinue PKS complied with the 

2. 

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), provides, in pertinent part 

that, “the services of no permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions 

of this section while any probationary employee, or any other employee with less 

22 

seniority, is retained to render a service which said permanent employee is certificated 

and competent to render.” 

3. 

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (c), provides that: 

The governing board shall make assignments and 

reassignments in such a manner that employees shall be 

retained to render any service which their seniority and 

qualifications entitle them to render. However, prior to 

assigning or reassigning any certificated employee to teach 

a subject which he or she has not previously taught, and for 

which he or she does not have a teaching credential or 

which is not within the employee’s major area of 

postsecondary study or the equivalent thereof, the 

governing board shall require the employee to pass a 

subject matter competency test in the appropriate subject. 

Cause Does Not Exist to Delay Assigning or Reassigning the TOSA and 

Resource Teacher Induction PKS  

4. 

Cause does not exist to affirm the District’s decision to delay assigning or 

reassigning the .40 TOSA induction PKS and .60 Resource Teacher Induction PKS 

positions. The District’s decision violates the Education Code section 44955 mandate 

that the District operate within the layoff process for both PKS categories and “make 

assignments and reassignments in such a manner that employees shall be retained to 

render any service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render.” (Ed. 

Code, § 44955, subd. (c).) By delaying the assignment or reassignment of both PKS 

categories until sometime in the future, the District may deviate from the seniority list 

23 

it is required to follow. To ensure that this does not happen, within two weeks of the 

adoption of this decision, the District will assign or reassign any employees under the 

.40 TOSA induction PKS and .60 Resource Teacher Induction PKS and perform any 

required bumping, or other analysis, that may be necessary for the District to perform 

under the Education Code section 44955 criteria. If the assignment or reassignment of 

both PKS categories requires modification of the employees designated to be laid-off 

as identified in Appendix A, the District will modify this list accordingly, and as 

appropriate, provide affected employees with required notices. 

Cause Exists to Affirm the Layoff Notices Issued to the Respondents 

and the Other Teachers Identified in Appendix A 

5. 

Cause exists to affirm the layoff notices issued to the teachers identified 

in Appendix A below whose services are proposed for reduction or discontinuance per 

the District’s resolution. A preponderance of the evidence sustained the District’s 

statements of reduction in force served on respondents concerning the PKS that will 

not be required. The District’s action to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of 

services relates solely to the welfare of the District’s schools and the pupils thereof 

within the meaning of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. 

According to, and within the limits of, Resolution No. 4658 identifying PKS for 

reduction or elimination by Full-Time Equivalents, notices may be given to the 

respondents identified in Appendix A that their services will be reduced or will not be 

required for the 2020-2021 school year. 

ORDER 

24 

Within two weeks of the adoption of this decision the District will assign or 

reassign the .40 TOSA induction PKS and .60 Resource Teacher Induction PKS positions 

consistent with the criteria under Section 44955. As appropriate, the District may 

modify the list of employees designated to be laid-off who are identified in Appendix 

A and provide employees impacted by any modification of this list with required 

notices.
