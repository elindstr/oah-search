FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

Prior  to  January  25,  2005,  Dianna  R.  Garcia,  Assistant  Superintendent  for 

Human  Resources  of  the  District,  sent  a  written  recommendation  to  the  Governing  Board  of 
District  for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  (PKS),  in  order  to 
reduce  expenses  for  the  2005-06  school  year.  As  a  result  of  the  Governor’s  January  2005 
budget  proposal,  the  District  expected  to  experience  a  budget  shortfall  of  $19  million,  in 
addition  to  an  already  existing  budget  gap  due  to  declining  enrollment  and  other  issues.  Ms. 
Garcia  recommended  the  elimination  of  approximately  483.15  full-time  equivalent  (FTE) 
certificated  positions,  which  represented  approximately  $26,780,870 
reduction. 

in  expenditure 

2. 

On  January  25,  2005,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  adopted  Resolution 

No.  2329,  authorizing  the  reduction  or  elimination  of  particular  kinds  of  services,  and 
directed  the  Assistant  Superintendent  of  Human  Resources,  or  his  or  her  designee,  to  send 
notices  to  certificated  employees  in  463.97  FTE  positions  that  their  services  would  not  be 
required  for  the  2005-06  school  year.  The  Governing  Board  also  adopted  Resolution  No. 
2330,  Resolution  Specifying  Criteria  to  be  Used  to  Determine  the  Order  of  Termination  of 
Certificated  Employees  Who  First  Rendered  Paid  Service  on  the  Same  Date  (tiebreaker 
criteria).  The  Governing  Board  based  the  criteria  upon  the  needs  of  the  District  and  of  its 
students,  and  acted  within  its  discretion  in  creating  the  tiebreaker  criteria. 

3. 

On  March  8,  2005,  the  Governing  Board  revised  Resolution  No.  2329, 

authorizing  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  488.65  FTE  certificated  positions  for  the 
2005-06  school  year. 

4. 

On  or  before  March  15,  2005,  Ms.  Garcia  caused  to  be  served  on  all 
respondents,  except  for  Kim  Zeltvay,  written  notices  of  the  recommendation  to  the 
Governing  Board  that  respondents’  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  school 
year  due  to  a  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  PKS  (March  15  Notice).  The  March  15  Notice 
set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation,  as  required  by  Education  Code  sections  44949 
and  44955.  The  March  15  Notice  informed  respondents  that,  if  they  wished  to  request  a 
hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for  not  re-employing  them  for  the  ensuing  school  year, 
the  request  “must  be  in  writing  and  be  received  by  Human  Resources  at  3738  Walnut 
Avenue,  Carmichael,  California,  on  or  before  5:00  p.m.,  March  22,  2005.” 

Attached  to  each  March  15 Notice  was  a  blank  Request  for  Hearing  form. 

5. 

Approximately  316  employees  filed  Request  for  Hearing  forms  by  the  March 

22,  2005  deadline.  Five  additional  employees,  including  respondent  Kristen  Edington, 
submitted  requests  for  hearing  after  March  22,  2005,  but  prior  to  the  issuance  of  the 
Accusation.

6. 

Larry  Graser,  Director  of  Human  Resources  for  the  District,  filed  the 
Accusation  in  his  official  capacity.  The  Accusation  was  served  on  March  25,  2005. 

7. 

Following  service  of  the  Accusation,  the  District  received  late  requests  for 

hearing  from  respondents  Zachary  Lovell,  Colleen  Kelly  and  Richard  Myers. 

8. 

Pursuant  to  a  Stipulation  between  the  District  and  counsel  for  the  represented 
respondents,  respondents’  counsel  filed  one  Notice  of  Defense  on  their  behalf,  dated  March 
30,  2005.  Respondent  Theresa  Altieri  also  filed  a  timely  Notice  of  Defense  pursuant  to 
Education  Code  section  44949,  subdivision  (c)(1)  and  Government  Code  section  11506. 

Thereafter,  the  matter  was  set  for  hearing. 

9. 

Respondent  Kim  Zeltvay’s  name  was  inadvertently  omitted  from  the  list  of 

employees  to  whom  the  preliminary  notices  of  layoff  were  sent.  When  the  error  was 
discovered,  Larry  Graser  hand-delivered  Ms.  Zeltvay’s  notice  to  her  on  March  17,  2005.  Ms. 
Zeltvay  submitted  a  timely  request  for  hearing.!  She  was  served  with  the  Accusation  by  mail 
on  March  25,  2005.  She  did  not  file  a  Notice  of  Defense  as  required  by  Government  Code 
section  and  did  not  appear  or  otherwise  participate  in  the  administrative  hearing. 

Respondents  are  certificated  employees  of  the  District. 

Jurisdiction  for  the  subject  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code 

10. 

Il. 

sections  44949  and  44955. 

Late  Hearing  Requests 

12. 

Kristen  Edington.  Ms.  Edington  mailed  her  Request  for  Hearing  form  to  the 
District  on  March  21,  2005,  one  day  before  the  deadline.  The  District  received  the  Request 
for  Hearing  form  in  the  mail  on  March  23,  2005,  the  day  after  the  March  22,  2005  deadline. 
The  March  15  Notice  explicitly  stated  that  the  request  for  a  hearing  had  to  be  received  by 
Human  Resources  on  or  before  5:00  p.m.  on  March  22,  2005.  The  March  15  Notice  further 
stated,  “If  you  fail  to  request  a  hearing  on  or  before  this  date,  your  failure  to  do  so  shall 
constitute  a  waiver  of  your  right  to  a  hearing.”  Ms.  Edington  did  not  testify  at  the  hearing  to 
explain  why  she  mailed  the  Request  for  Hearing  form  instead  of  delivering  it  to  the  District 
office  by  the  deadline.  Under  the  circumstances,  good  cause  was  not  established  to  excuse 
Ms.  Edington’s  late  hearing  request;  her  right  to  a  hearing  was  waived. 

  

'  The  District  contends  that  the  failure  to  serve  Ms.  Zeltvay  with  a  March  15  Notice  on  or  before  March  15,  2005,  as 
required  by  Education  Code  section  44949,  subdivision  (a),  constituted  a  “non-substantive  procedural  error”  within 
the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949,  subdivision  (c)(3),  and  Ms.  Zeltvay  was  not  prejudiced  by  the 
District’s  error,  in  that  she  filed  a  timely  request  for  hearing  and  was  served  with  the  Accusation.  Inasmuch  as  Ms. 
Zeltvay  did  not  pursue  her  rights  under  the  Education  Code,  in  that  she  failed  to  file  a  Notice  of  Defense  and 
participate  in  the  administrative  hearing,  no  determination  is  made  herein  as  to  whether  the  District’s  failure  to  give 
notice  “no  later  than  March  15”  was  a  substantive  (jurisdictional)  error  requiring  the  District  to  dismiss  the 
Accusation  against  Ms.  Zeltvay  and  rescind  the  layoff  notice  previously  issued  to  her.

13. 

Colleen  Kelly.  The  District  received  Ms.  Kelly’s  Request  for  Hearing  form  on 

Tuesday,  March  29,  2005.  Ms.  Kelly  has  been  on  maternity  leave  since  January  2005.  She 
left  town  to  visit  her  family  in  Hawaii  on  March  13,  2005,  before  the  March  15  Notice  was 
mailed  to  her.  She  returned  to  her  home  in  Placerville  on  Saturday,  March  26,  2005  at  about 
3:00  a.m.  The  certified  mail  slip  was  at  her  home,  and  she  picked  up  the  March  15  Notice 
from  the  post  office  on  Saturday,  March  26,  2005.  On  Monday,  March  28,  2005,  Ms.  Kelly 
called  the  offices  of  counsel  for  the  San  Juan  Teachers  Association  (Union)  and  made  an 
appointment  to  come  in  on  Tuesday,  March  29,  2005,  to  sign  the  Request  for  Hearing  form. 
At  hearing,  Ms.  Kelly  testified  that  she  was  unable  to  go  to  the  office  on  Monday,  March  28, 
2005,  due  to  child  care  issues.  No  one  from  the  District  or  the  Union  contacted  Ms.  Kelly 
prior  to  the  issuance  of  the  March  15  Notice  to  alert  her  to  the  possibility  that  she  might  be 
subject  to  layoff.  She  did  receive  a  layoff  notice  in  March  of  2004,  but  she  did  not  attend  the 
hearing,  and  was  generally  unaware  of  the  process  for  requesting  a  hearing. 

Under  all  the  facts  and  circumstances,  Ms.  Kelly  has  established  good  cause  for  her 

failure  to  file  a  timely  Request  for  Hearing  form.  She  shall  be  permitted  to  remain  asa 
respondent  and  participate  in  these  proceedings.

14. 

Richard  Myers.  The  District  received  Mr.  Myers’  Request  for  Hearing  form 

on  Tuesday,  March  29,  2005.  Mr.  Myers  was  not  specifically  told  that  he  would  be  receiving 
a  layoff  notice,  but  it  was  “inferred”  by  his  site  administrator  that  he  might  be  laid  off.  The 
impending  layoffs  were  also  discussed  at  a  Union  meeting  that  Mr.  Myers  attended.  At  that 
meeting,  Mr.  Myers  was  told  to  contact  the  Union  if  he  received  a  layoff  notice.  Mr.  Myers’ 
left  on  vacation  on  Friday,  March  18,  2005.2  Mr.  Myers returned  from  vacation  on 
Wednesday,  March  23,  2005.  He  went  to  the  post  office  to  pick  up  the  March  15  Notice  on 
that  date.  He  called  the  Union  and  learned  that  the  office  was  closed  until  Monday,  March 
28,  2005.  On  Thursday,  March  25,  2005,  Mr.  Myers  called  the  District  office  and  spoke  to 
Mr.  Graser  about  a  credentialing  issue.  He  did  not  discuss  the  layoff  notice  with  Mr.  Graser. 
On  Monday,  March  28,  2005,  Mr.  Myers  went  to  the  Union  office  to  sign  a  Request  for 
Hearing  form.  The  form  was  faxed  to  the  District  on  Tuesday,  March  29,  2005.  Mr.  Myers 
had  not  received  a  layoff  notice  in  his  teaching  career  prior  to  2005. 

The  District  contends  that  Mr.  Myers  did  not  act  in  a  timely  manner  to  request  a 
hearing,  in  part  because  he  waited  until  the  Union  office  was  open  to  file  his  Request  for 
Hearing  form  through  the  Union.  The  District  noted  that  Mr.  Myers  was  aware  of  the  fact 
that  the  District  office  was  open  during  spring  break,  in  that  he  spoke  to  Mr.  Graser  on 
March  24,  2005;  the  March  15,  2005  letter  states  that  the  request  for  hearing  must  be  filed 
with  the  District,  and  does  not  mention  the  Union. 

Under  all  of  the  facts  and  circumstances  herein,  Mr.  Myers  acted  reasonably  in 
waiting  until  Monday,  March  28,  2005  to  contact  the  Union  about  the  March  15  Notice.  Mr. 
Myers  was  not  able  to  pick  up  the  March  15  Notice  until  March  23,  2005,  one  day  after  the 

  

?  Friday,  March  18,  2005,  was  the  last  day  of  school  before  spring  break.  School  was  not  in  session  on  March  21- 
25,  2005.  However,  the  District  office  was  open  during  the  week  of  spring  break.

~ 

March  22,  2005  deadline;  therefore,  he  would  not  have  been  able  to  meet  the  statutory  - 
timetable,  even  if  he  had  submitted  the  Request  for  Hearing  form  directly  to  the  District  on 
that  date.  The  District  was  not  prejudiced  by  Mr.  Myers’  having  filed  his  Request  for 
Hearing  form  on  Tuesday,  March  29,  2005.  He  shall  be  permitted  to  remain  as  a  respondent 
and  participate in  these  proceedings. 

15. 

Zachary  Lovell.  The  District  received  Mr.  Lovell’s  Request  for  Hearing  form 

on  Monday,  March  28,  2005.  Mr.  Lovell  left  Sacramento  on  Thursday,  March  17,  2005,  to 
attend  a  work-related  professional  conference.  He  had  not  received  the  March  15  Notice 
prior  to  leaving  for  the  conference.  Mr.  Lovell  returned  from  the  conference  on  Sunday, 
March  20,  2005.  The  certified  mail  notice  for  the  March  15  Notice  was  in  his  mail  when  he 
returned  home.  Mr.  Lovell  testified  that  he  “assumed  it  was  a  layoff  slip.”  Mr.  Lovell 
received  a  second  certified  mail  notice  on  Monday,  March  21,  2005.  However,  Mr.  Lovell 
did  not  go  to  the  post  office  to  pick  up  the  March  15  Notice  until  about  4:30  p.m.  on 
Tuesday,  March  22,  2005,  the  deadline  for  submission  of  the  Request  for  Hearing  form  to  the 
District.  Mr.  Lovell  called  the  Union  office  and  listened  to  a  recorded  message  stating  that 
the  office  was  closed  until  Monday,  March  28,  2005.  Despite  the  fact  that  the  District  office 
was  open  until  5  p.m.  on  March  22,  2005,  Mr.  Lovell  did  not  submit  the  Request  for  Hearing 
form  that  was  part  of  the  March  15  Notice  packet  to  the  District  by  the  deadline.  Mr.  Lovell 
called  the  District  office  during  the  week  of  March  21-25,  2005,  to  discuss  a  credential  issue, 
but  he  did  not  discuss  the  layoff  notice  with  anyone  at  the  District.  Mr.  Lovell  went  to  the 
Union  office  on  Monday,  March  28,  2005  to  sign  a  Request  for  Hearing  form,  which  was 
thereafter  faxed  to  the  District.  Mr.  Lovell  had  received  a  layoff  notice  in  the  spring  of  2003. 
At  that  time,  he  filed  his  Request  for  Hearing  form  through  the  Union. 

Under  all  of  the  facts  and  circumstances,  Mr.  Lovell  did  not  act  diligently  to  submit 
his  Request  for  Hearing  form  by  the  March  22,  2005  deadline.  Consequently,  he  is  deemed 
to  have  waived  his  right  to  a  hearing,  and  is  not  entitled  to  participate  in  these  proceedings. 

Reduction/Elimination  of PKS 

16.  —  Resolution  No.  2329,  as  revised  on  March  8,  2005,  authorized  the  reduction  or 

elimination  of  488.65  FTE  positions,  including  255.01  FTE  K-6  teachers,  due  to  the 
proposed  elimination  of  elementary  class  size  reduction,  and  71.83  FTE  Elementary 
Specialists,  due  to  the  elimination  of  the  K-6  planning  period.  As  a  result  of  financial 
concessions  obtained  during  negotiations  with  the  Union  in  February  and  March  2005,  the 
District  determined  that  it  would  be  able  to  retain  certain  services  that  were  previously 
identified  for  reduction  or  elimination  in  Resolution  No.  2329.  On  March  29,  2005,  the 
Governing  Board  authorized  the  District  Superintendent  to  rescind  the  layoff  notices  for  the 
employees  impacted  by  the  elimination  of  the  elementary  class  size  reduction  program  and 
elementary  preparation.  The  District  identified  additional  respondents  for  whom  the  layoff 
notices  were  to  be  rescinded,  due  to  application  of  the  tiebreaking  criteria,  or  as  a  result  of 
errors  by  the  District.  At  a  Prehearing  Conference  held  between  the  parties  on  April  12, 
2005  (PHC),  the  District  filed  a  Motion  to  Dismiss  Accusation  as  to  Certain  Respondents, 
which  was  granted.  At  hearing,  the  District’s  motion  to  dismiss  the  Accusation  as  to

respondents  Phe  Bach,  Svetlana  Frankenberger,  Thomas  Shaw,  and  Timothy  Slattery,  was 
granted. 

17. 

As  aresult  of  the  Governing  Board’s  revisions  to  Resolution  No.  2329,  both 
before  and  after  March  15,  2005,  the  District  proposes  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of 
PKS  totaling  173.43  FTE  positions,  beginning  not  later  than  the  commencement  of  the  2005- 
06  school  year,  as  follows:

Employment  Status  and  Seniority 

18. 

Tenure  is  the  relationship  between  a  teacher  and  the  District  which  gives  the 

teacher  greater  job  security. 

Seniority  is  the  relationship  between  the  teachers  within  a  school  district.  Among  the 

teachers  credentialed  to  provide  a  given  service,  greater  seniority  in  the  District  gives  a 
greater  legal  entitlement  to  a  position,  see  Ferner  v.  Harris  (1975)  45  Cal.App.3d  363. 

A  teacher  who  serves  over  75  percent  of  the  regular  school  year  either  as  a  temporary 

or  in  one  position  replacing  one  teacher  partially  as  a  long  term  substitute  and  partially  as  a 
temporary,  receives  credit  toward  tenure  for  the  whole  school  year.  In  either  instance,  the 
teacher  receives  credit  toward  seniority  from  the  start  of  service  as  a  temporary  if  rehired  at 
the  start  of  the  ensuing  school  year  without  a  break  in  service.  If  there  is  a  break  in  service, 
even  of  one  day,  then  seniority  starts  after  the  break  in  service. 

Thus,  if  there  is  a  break  in  service  between  the  qualifying  service  for  working  over  75 
percent  of  a  school  year  and  the  start  of  service  in  the  next  school  year,  whether  the  break  is 
at  the  end  of  the  one  school  year  or  at  the  start  of  the  next  school  year,  then  the  teacher  is 
given  credit  toward  tenure  for  the  earlier  school  year  but  credit  toward  seniority  starts  with 
the  first  day  of  paid  service  of  the  later  school  year. 

The  District  defines  seniority  as  the  first  date  in  paid  service  under  contract  without  a 
break  in  service.  The  District  correctly  applied  the  above  rules  in  determining  the  tenure  date 
and  date  of  hire  or  rehire  (seniority)  for  the  teachers  affected  by  this  layoff. 

19. 

In  laté  November  or'early  December  of  2004,  the  District  sent  individual  _ 

letters  to  each  credentialed  employee  soliciting  input  regarding:  their  address;  first  date  of  © 
paid  service;  credentials;  and  other  relevant  information.  The  District  asked  that  they 
respond  to  Human  Resources  on  the  form  provided  by  January  7,  2005,  and  that  they  sign  the 
form.

forms  into  its  computer  records,  and  thereafter  generated  a  Seniority  List  of  over  2,400 
certificated  teachers. 

On  February  7,  2005,  the  District  posted  the  Certificated  Non-management  Seniority 

List  in  the  main  lobby  of  the  District  office  in  two  large  binders,  by  date  of  seniority  and 
alphabetically.  The  Seniority  Lists  were  available  for  review  during  business  hours,  to  give 
employees  an  opportunity  to  point  out  inaccuracies. 

Bumping  and  Skipping 

20. 

Economic  layoffs  are  generally  to  be  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  seniority.  A 
teacher  with  more  seniority  typically  has  greater  rights  to  retain  employment  than  a  junior 
teacher.  A  senior  teacher  whose  position  is  discontinued  has  the  right  to  a  position  held  by  a 
junior  teacher  if  the  senior  teacher  is  properly  credentialed.  That  displacement  of  a  junior 
teacher  is  known  as  “bumping.”  The  District  has  an  affirmative  obligation  to  reassign  senior 
teachers  who  are  losing  their  positions  into  positions  held  by  junior  teachers  if  the  senior 
teacher  has  both  the  credentials  and  competence  to  occupy  such  positions.  The  seniority  rule 
is  not  absolute,  and  a  junior  teacher  with  a  needed  credential  or  skills  may  be  retained  even  if 
a  more  senior  teacher  is  terminated.  Such  “skipping”  is  recognized  by  statute  (Education 
Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (d)(1))  and  appellate  law  (Santa  Clara  Federation  of 
Teachers,  Local  2393  v.  Governing  Board  of the  Santa  Clara  Unified  School  District  (1981) 
116  Cal.App.3d  831).  In  order  to  depart  from  a  seniority-based  economic  layoff,  Education 
Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (d)(1),  requires  the  District  to  “demonstrates  a  specific  need 
for  personnel  to  teach  a  specific  course  or  course  of  study...  and  that  the  certificated 
employee  (to  be  skipped)  has  special  training  and  experience  necessary  to  teach  that  course 
or  course  of  study...which  others  with  more  seniority  do  not  possess.” 

Identification  of Employees for  Layoff 

21. 

After  the  District  identified  PKS  to  be  reduced  or  eliminated,  the District 

generated  a  list  of  employees  directly  affected  by  the  Governing  Board’s  decision.  After 
identifying  teachers  in  temporary  or  provisional  positions  to  be  given  notices  of  termination 
of  employment,  the  District  looked  at  the  certificated  employees  affected  by  the  PKS 
reduction/elimination,  beginning  with  the  most  senior,  and  permitted  them  to  “bump”  into 
positions  for  which  they  were  certificated  and  qualified,  beginning  with  the  least  senior 
certificated  employee.  The  District  was  not  required  to  bump  and  re-bump  to  save  a 
particular  teacher  nor  was  it  required  to  do  bumping  in  any  particular  way.  Nor  was  it 
required  to  make  assignments  and  reassignments  to  transfer  more  senior  employees  to  other 
positions  in  order  to  retain  more  junior  employees.  Thus,  the  District  has  the  discretion  to 
determine  how  it  carried  out  the  bumping  process,  and  so  long  as  it  did  not  act  arbitrarily  or 
capriciously,  the  process  was  valid.

“Skipping”  of Special  Education  Teachers 

22. 

The  District  is  retaining  all  currently  employed  Special  Education  teachers, 

even  if  they  were  subject  to  being  “bumped”  by  more  senior  certificated  employees  subject  to 
layoff,  because  of  the  great  difficulty  experienced  by  the  District  in  recruiting  and  hiring 
qualified  Special  Education  teachers.  According  to  John  Sayler,  Director  of  Special 
Education,  when  a  teacher  without  a  full  Special  Education  credential  expresses  a  desire  to 
teach  in  Special  Education  and  has  particular  skills  or  experience,  a  screening  process  occurs 
to  determine  whether  the  teacher  is  sufficiently  qualified.  If  they  are,  the  District  may  seek 
an  emergency  credential  on  their  behalf  while  they  obtain  the  necessary  coursework  to 
acquire  a  Special  Education  credential.  The  screening  process  involves  an  interview  by  a 
_panel  made  up  of  a  program  specialist,  a  specialist  in  the  particular  area  needed,  and  one 
other  panel  member. 

~ 

23. 

The  District  is  retaining  the  following  Special  Education  teachers,  whose  only 
authorization  to  teach  Special  Education  is  on  the  basis  of  an  Emergency  Credential:  Daniel 
Gillen  (seniority  date  08/29/03);  Jennifer  Dorunda  (seniority  date  08/19/02);  Kristin 
Buckhold  (seniority  date  08/19/02);  and,  Maryjo  Tommasi  (seniority  date  08/19/02). 
According  to  District  records,  both  Mr.  Gillen  and  Ms.  Dorunda  are  probationary  teachers, 
while  Ms.  Buckhold  and  Ms.  Tommasi  are  classified  as  permanent.  Mr.  Gillen  possesses  a 
Multiple  Subject  teaching  credential  in  addition  to  the  Emergency  Special  Education 
Credential.  Ms.  Dorunda  is  not  credentialed  except  for  the  Emergency  Special  Education 
Credential.  Ms.  Buckhold  possesses  a  Multiple  Subject  teaching  credential  in  addition  to  the 
Emergency  Special  Education  Credential,  and  Ms.  Tommasi  possesses  a  Single  Subject 
Social  Science  credential  in  addition  to  the  Emergency  Special  Education  Credential. 
Respondents  with  similar  credentials  and  more  seniority  are  being  laid  off,  while  these  four  _ 
teachers  are  being  retained  on  the  basis  of  their  emergency  credentials  only. 

24. 

Respondent  Stephanie  Floyd-Smith  (seniority  date  08/19/02)  possesses  a 

Multiple  Subject  teaching  credential  and  National  Board  Certification. 
She  is  classified  by 
the  District  as  a  permanent  employee.  She  testified  at  hearing  that  she  would  be  willing  to 
teach  Special  Education  on  an  Emergency  Credential  and  would  be  willing  to  comply  with 
the  requirements  which  a  teacher  must  meet  to  obtain  an  Emergency  Credential;  she  admitted 
that  she  has  never  expressed  that  interest  to  anyone  in  the  District  prior  to  her  testimony. 

Respondents  are  not  contesting  the  District’s  right  to  “skip”  Special  Education 
teachers  with  emergency  credentials.  However,  respondents  note  that,  as  a  permanent 
employee,  Ms.  Floyd-Smith  is  more  senior  than  the  two  probationary  teachers,  Mr.  Gillen 
and  Ms.  Dorunda.  Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (b),  states  in  part  that,  “...the 
services  of  no  permanent  employee  may  be  terminated  under  the  provisions  of  this  section 
while  any  probationary  employee,  or  any  employee  with  less  seniority,  is  retained  to  render  a 
service  which  said  permanent  employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render.”  Both  Mr. 
Gillen  and  Ms.  Floyd-Smith  possess  Multiple  Subject  teaching  credentials,  while  Ms. 
Dorunda  possesses  no  base  credential.  Respondents  contend  that,  as  a  permanent  employee, 
Ms.  Floyd-Smith  should  have  been  allowed  to  “bump”  one  of  these  emergency  credentialed

teachers,  and  the  District  should  be  required  to  seek  an  emergency  credential  on  her  behalf. 
Respondents  rely  on  California  Teachers  Association  v.  Governing  Board  Of  Golden  Valley 
Unified  School  District  (2002)  98  Cal.App.4th  369,  in  which  the  Court  stated  that  the 
employing  school  district  had  an  “obligation  to  apply  for  the  emergency  permit”  for  an 
otherwise  uncredentialed  employee  in  order  to  carry  out  its  duty  to  put  the  employee’s 
contract  into  effect.  (/d.,  at  p.  385.)  However,  the  facts  in  Golden  Valley  are  distinguishable 
from  the  facts  herein.  In  Golden  Valley,  the  school  district  had  entered  into  an  employment 
contract  for  the  ensuing  school  year  with  a  teacher  holding  an  emergency  permit;  prior  to  the 
start  of  school,  that  district  attempted  to  abrogate  the  terms  of  the  employment  contract  by 
claiming  that  “it  could  not  legitimately  provide  the  CTC  [Commission  on  Teacher 
Credentialing]  with  a  declaration  of  need  to  justify  the  CTC  issuing  an  emergency  permit  to. 
[the  teacher]  for  the  1999-2000  school  year  in  light  of  the  more  than  25  applications  Golden 
Valley  received  from  teachers  who  were  fully  credentialed  and  qualified  to  teach.”  (d.,  at  p. 
384).  The  Court  held  that  the  school  district  had  an  obligation  to  perform  a  diligent  search 
for  qualified  teachers  before  entering  into  a  contract  with  a  teacher  holding  an  emergency 
permit;  “Furthermore,  Golden  Valley’s  obligation  to  apply  for  the  emergency  permit  is 
imposed  by  implication  under  the  contract  because  such  an  obligation  is  necessary  to  carry 
the  contract  into  effect.”  U/d.,  at  p.  385,  emphasis  supplied).  In  contrast,  there  was  no 
contractual  obligation  between  the  District  and  Ms.  Floyd-Smith  that  compelled  the  District 
to  seek  an  emergency  credential  for  her  to  teach  Special  Education,  especially  when  she  did 
not  express  any  interest  in  doing  so  prior  to  issuance  of  the  March  15  Notice.  Respondents’ 
argument  is  not  persuasive. 

Over-Noticing  of  Counselors 

25. 

Pursuant  to  Resolution  No.  2329,  as  revised’,  the  Governing  Board  authorized 

the  reduction  of  counseling  services  totaling  41.20  FTE,  broken  down  as  follows: 

General  Fund/Unrestricted  Fund  Positions 
A-19 
A-20 

Counselors  K-12 
Counselors  —  Independent  Study 

33.50  FTE 
2.00  FTE 

Grants  and  Categorical  Positions 
B-7 

Counselors 

5.70  FTE 

According  to  the  testimony  of  Mr.  Graser,  it  was  the  intention  of  the  District  to 
discontinue  counseling  services  in  the  District  and  eliminate  all  counseling  positions.  He  did 
not  know  why  Exhibit  A-1  contained  a  breakdown  of  positions  by  funding  source. 

26. 

Ina  document  prepared  by  the  District  on  February  17,  2005,  entitled  “PKS 

A19”  (Respondent’s  Exhibit  E),  the  District  identified  38.60  FTE  counselors  characterized  as 

  

>  Revised  Exhibit  A-1,  Certificated,  dated  April  13,  2005,  attached  to  the  District’s  April  12,  2005  Motion  to 
Dismiss  Accusation  as  to  Certain  Respondents  (Exhibit  A-1). 

10

A-19%,  1.50  FTE  counselors  as  A-20,  and  1.00  FTE  counselor  as  B-7.  In  a  document 
prepared  by  the  District  on  April  14,  2005,  entitled,  “Distribution  of  Counselors,”  (District’s 
Exhibit  24),  the  District  identified  30.20  FTE  A-19  (K-12)  counselors  entirely  funded  with 
. 
general/unrestricted  funds;  1.50  FTE  A-20  independent  study  counselors;  1.30  FTE  B-7 
counselors  in  special  programs  funded  by  grants  and  categorical  funding;  and  8.10  FTE 
counselors  working  as  K-12  counselors,  whose  funding  came  in  whole  or  in  part  from. 
categorical  funding”,  for  a  total  of  41.10  FTE  counselor  positions. 

27. 

—  Respondents  contend  that  the  District  may  only  lay  off  at  most  31.50  FTE 

A-19  counselors®  (the  maximum  number  of  general  fund/unrestricted  fund  counselor 
positions),  1.50  FTE  A-20  counselors  (the  maximum  number  of  independent  study 
counselors),  and  5.70  FTE  B-7  counselors  (the  maximum  number  of  grant  and  categorically 
funded  counselor  positions  authorized  for  reduction  by  Exhibit  A-1),  for  a  total  of  38.70  FTE 
positions.  Thus,  by respondents’  calculation,  the  District  “over-noticed”  2.40  FTE 
counselors,  the  most  senior  of  whom  should  be  retained.  On  the  other  hand,  the  District 
contends  that  the  categorization  of  the  funding  sources  for  counselor  positions  on  Exhibit 
_A-1  was  part  of  the  District’s  attempt  to  identify  all  of  the  counselors  rendering  services  to  be 
eliminated,  and  was  not  itself  a  “particular  kind  of  service.”  The  District  further  argues  that, 
at  most,  the  identification  of  positions  by  funding  source  was  a  “non-substantive  procedural 
error’  that  did  not  prejudice  the  respondents,  since  the  total  number  of  positions  identified  in 
Exhibit  A-1,  41.20  FTE,  was  greater  than  the  positions  of  individuals  affected  by  the  layoff, 
41.10  FTE.  Thus,  the  District  contends  it  should  not  be  prevented  from  discontinuing 
counseling  services  in  the  District. 

| 

. 

Under  all  the  facts  and  circumstances  herein,  the  District’s  argument  is  persuasive. 

The  District  identified  41.2  FTE  counselor  positions  to  be  eliminated  as  a  result  of  a 
reduction  or  discontinuation  of  PKS.  The  fact  that,  as  the  evidence  developed  at  hearing,  the 
funding  sources  for  these  positions  was  not  as  was  reflected  in  Exhibit  A-1  does  not  deprive 
the  District  of  the  right  to  make  those  reductions.  As  was  noted  in  Santa  Clara  Federation  of 
Teachers,  Local  2393  vy.  Governing  Board  of Santa  Clara  Unified  School  District  (1981)  116 
Cal.App.3d  831,  at  841  (emphasis  supplied): 

The  March  15  notice  is  only  the  first  step  in  the  termination  process. 
Karbach  [Karbach  y.  Board  of Education  (1974)  39  Cal.App.3d  355] 
does  not  require  that  this  preliminary  notice  specify  the  precise  number 
of  teachers  to  be  terminated  or  the  specific  positions  to  be  eliminated; 
those  details  emerge  as  the  administrative  hearing  process  progresses. 
It  is  enough  that  the  Board  specify  in  the  March  15  notice  the  statutory 
grounds  set  forth  in  section  13447  [now  Education  Code  section  44955] 
for  staff  reductions. 

  

*  This  number  includes  Kent  Liebermann,  1.00  FTE  K-12  counselor. 
°  Of  this  8.10  FTE,  1.30  FTE  positions  were  funded  from  general/unrestricted  funds,  and  6.80  FTE  positions  were 
funded  from  categorical  funds. 
°  30,20  FTE  plus  1.30  FTE  positions.

Kenyan  Epps  and  6"  Grade  Middle  School  Social  Science 

28.  |  Kenyan  Epps  (seniority  date  08/21/02)  is  currently  employed  as  a  1.0  FTE 

sixth  grade  middle  school  teacher  who  is  teaching  Social  Science  for  .80  FTE  and  Tutorial 
for  .20  FTE.  Mr.  Epps  received  a  March  15  Notice  because  he  is  being  “bumped”  for  .20 
FTE  from  his  Tutorial  class  by  Michael  Gebhardt  (seniority  date  04/26/76);  the  remaining  .80 
FTE  reduction  of  Mr.  Epps’  position  is  due  to  the  PKS  reduction  in  category  “A09.”  Mr. 
Graser  testified  at  hearing  that  category  ““A09”  is  the  PKS  reduction  for  “7-12  Social  Science 
Teacher.”  Because  Mr.  Epps  does  not  teach  Social  Science  in  grades  7-12,  he  was  not 
properly  identified  as  an  “affected”  employee  as  part  of  that  PKS  reduction  in  Social  Science 
teaching.  While  Mr.  Graser  testified  that  a  more  senior  Social  Science  teacher  would  have 
been  affected  by  the  PKS  reduction  in  7-12  Social  Science  and  would  have  then  “bumped” 
Mr.  Epps  out  of  his  .80  FTE  Social  Science  position,  the  District  did  not  present  evidence  at 
hearing  regarding  who  would  have  “bumped”  Mr.  Epps  from  his  position.  Mr.  Epps  is  the 
most  senior  teacher  credentialed  to  teach  departmentalized  classes  in  Social  Science  who  is 
being  laid  off,  and  there  is  no  one  with  more  seniority  who  can  “bump”  him.  Therefore,  Mr. 
Epps  must  be  retained  for  .80  FTE. 

David  Nobis  and  Driver’s  Education 

29. 

David  Nobis  (seniority  date  08/29/03)  is  currently  employed  as  a  1.00  FTE 

high  school  teacher,  assigned  to  teach  Drivers’  Education  for  .67  FTE,  and  as  Athletic 
Director  for  .33  FTE.  In  Respondents’  Closing  Brief,  respondents  raised  the  issue  of  whether 
the  District’s  proposal  to  “bump”  Mr.  Nobis  from  his  position  as  a  .67  FTE  Drivers’ 
Education  teacher  was  proper.  Mr.  Nobis  did  not  file  a  request  for  hearing  in  this  matter,  and 
he  is  not  a  respondent  in  this  proceeding.  Consequently,  no  ruling  is  made  concerning  this 
issue. 

Zachary  Lovell  and  Health 

30. 

Zachary  Lovell’  (seniority  date  01/17/03)  is  currently  employed  as  a  1.0  FTE 

high  school  teacher,  assigned  to  teach  Physical  Education  for  .67  FTE  and  Health  for  .33 
FTE.  Mr.  Lovell  received  a  March  15  Notice  because  he  is  being  “bumped”  from  his 
position  by  two  administrators,  Kathleen  Tack  (seniority  date  08/30/74)  for  .95  FTE  and 
Michael  Gebhardt  (seniority  date  04/26/76)  for  .05  FTE.  Both  Ms.  Tack  and  Mr.  Gebhardt 
are  credentialed to  teach  Physical  Education.  However,  neither  is  credentialed  to  teach 
Health.  Pursuant  to  Appendix-13  of  The  Administrator’s  Assignment  Manual  published  by 
the  California  Commission  on  Teacher  Credentialing,  “The  holder  of  a  Standard  Secondary 
Teaching  Credential  in  PE  may  obtain  a  supplementary  authorization  [in  health]  by 
completing  the  same  requirements  [i.e.,  completion  of  20  semester  units,  or  10  upper  division 
semester  units,  in  Health  Science],  or  by  verifying  three  years  of  experience  teaching  health 
prior  to  9-1-87  plus  subject  matter  competence  as  specified  in  Education  Code  Section  § 

   

7  As  a  result  of  his  filing  a  late  request  for  hearing,  Mr.  Lovell  waived  his  right  to  participate  in  these  proceedings. 
See  Finding  15  above. 

  

44258.7(a).”  The  District  presented  no  evidence  that  either  Ms.  Tack  or  Mr.  Gebhardt  has 
met  either  of  these  requirements,  and  no  Supplemental  authorization  for  Health  is  listed  for 
them  in  the  District’s  records.  Since  Ms.  Tack  and  Mr.  Gebhardt  lack  the  appropriate 
credential  to  teach  Health,  they  cannot  bump  Mr.  Lovell  from  the  .33  FTE  of  his  position  in 
which  he  teaches  Health.  Neither  Ms.  Tack  nor  Mr.  Gebhardt  received  the  March  15  Notice. 

There  are  two  probationary  teachers  with  more  seniority  than  Mr.  Lovell  who  are 
subject  to  layoff  and  who  do  possess  an  appropriate  credential  to  teach  Health  pursuant  to 
Appendix-13  of  The  Administrator’s  Assignment  Manual.  These  teachers  are  Laura  Pierson 
and  Tobias  Spencer,  both  having a  seniority  date  of  08/20/01,  and  both  possessing  a  Single 
Subject  credential  in  Life  Science,  which  is  one  of  the  appropriate  credentials  to  teach 
Health.  The  evidence  did  not  establish  that  the  District  ever  applied  the  tiebreaker  criteria  to 
these  individuals.  However,  based  upon  the  criteria  set  forth  in  Resolution  2330,  it  appears 
that  Mr.  Spencer  ‘has  greater  seniority  than  Ms.  Pierson  because  District  records  indicate  he 
possesses  a  “CLAD”®  authorization,  and  Ms.  Pierson  does  not.  Resolution  2330  states, 
“Employees  with  such  [CLAD]  certification  will  be  retained  prior  to  employees  without  such 
certification  regardless  of  points  calculated  below.”  Thus,  Mr.  Spencer  shall  be  retained  to 
teach  the  .33  FTE  Health  class(es)  currently  being  taught  by  Mr.  Lovell.” 

Employment  Status  of Molly  McFarland-Silva 

31. 

Molly  McFarland-Silva  has  been  employed  in  previous  school  years  as  a 

temporary  teacher  with  the  District.  She  believes  she  began  work  as  a  temporary  teacher  on 
August  19,  2002,  as  a  CORE  English  and  History  teacher  in  the  International  Baccalaureate 
(IB)  Program  at  Churchill  Middle  School.  At  the  start  of  the  2003-04  school  year,  she 
worked  as  a  substitute  teacher  until  she  signed  a  temporary  contract  on  September  24,  2003. 
During  the  2003-04  school  year,  she  was  employed  with  an  emergency  credential  in  her  same 
assignment  as  a  CORE  English  and  History  teacher  in  the  IB  Program  at  Churchill  Middle 
School.  In  March  of  2004,  Ms.  Silva  received  a  temporary  release  letter  from  the  District, 
dated  March  12,  2004,  indicating  that  her  employment  was  being  terminated  at  the  end  of  the 
school  year.  The  letter  stated  as  follows: 

Thank  you  for  your  service  in  the  San  Juan  Unified  School  District.  At 
this  time,  we  are  not  able  to  offer  you  a  position  for  the  2004-2005 
school  year.  Therefore,  pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44954,  you 
will  be  released  from  service  with  the  District  at  the  end  of  this  school 
year.  Should  you  receive  a  letter  offering  you  summer  employment, 
please  be  aware  that  this  does  not  obligate  the  District  to  hire  you 
beyond  the  2004  summer  school  session. 

  

®  Cross-cultural,  Language,  and  Academic  Development. 
?  Ms.  Pierson  did  not  file  a  request  for  hearing  in  this  matter,  and  she  is  not  a  respondent  in  this  proceeding;  she 
waived  her  right  to  contest  her  layoff,  and  would  not  be  retained  in  any  event.

If  you  would  like  to  be  considered  for  vacancies  for  which  you  are

32. 

During  the  summer  of  2004,  Ms.  Silva  was  in  contact  with  the  District 

concerning  employment  for  the  2004-05  school  year.  Ms.  Silva  had  exhausted  all  emergency 
credential  renewals,  and  District  records  indicate  that  her  emergency  credential  was  due  to 
expire  on  September  1,  2004.  District  records  indicate  that  on  July  23,  2004,  Denise  Moore, 
Personnel  Technician,  spoke  with  Ms.  Silva,  who  stated  that  she  was  waiting  to  receive  a 
C-19  “Letter  of  Issuance”  from  National  University  verifying  that  she  had  completed  all 
requirements  to  obtain  a  Professional  Clear  Multiple  Subject  credential  with  CLAD 
emphasis.  Ms.  Silva  was  again  offered  a  position  as  a  CORE  English  and  History  teacher  in 
the  IB  Program  at  Churchill  Middle  School  for  the  2004-05  school  year,  with  the 
understanding  that  she  would  provide  the  Letter  of  Issuance  to  the  District. 

National  University  sent  Ms.  Silva  the Letter  of  Issuance,  dated  August  13,  2004;  she 

testified  that  she  received  it  “‘a  few  days”  after  that  date.

Prior  to  August  18,  2004,  Ms.  Silva  was  contacted  by  the  principal  of 

Churchill  Middle  School,  Gloria  Baker,  who  informed  her  about  staff  development  days 
scheduled  for  August  18-19,  2004.  The  scheduling  of  staff  development  days  was  at  the 
discretion  of  each  school  site,  pursuant  to  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  between  the 
District  and  the  Union.  Ms.  Silva  attended  both  staff  development  days  at  the  invitation  of 
Ms.  Baker,  Pursuant  to'an  agreement  between  the  District  and  the  Union,  dated  December  9, 
2004,  employees  who  worked  staff  development  days  were  to  be  fully  reimbursed,  at  the 
employee’s  daily  rate  of  pay,  no  later  than  August  31,  2005. 

34. 

Ms.  Silva  went  to  the  District  office  on  the  morning  of  August  19,  2004  to  sign 

paperwork  for  the  new  school  year,  and  to  bring  in  the  Letter  of  Issuance.  She  was  told  the 
contract  was  not  ready  and  was  asked  to  come  back  that  afternoon.  She  was  also  told  that  the 
District  was  “waiting  for  the  Letter  of  Issuance”  before  preparing  the  employment  contract. 
Ms.  Silva  returned  to  the  District  office  after  attending  the  staff  development  day  on  August 
19,  2004.  At  that  time,  she  signed  a  temporary  contract,  as  well  as  an  Application  for 
Issuance  of  a  Temporary  County  Certificate.  The  contract  stated  that  Ms.  Silva’s  services  in 
the  temporary  position  “will  begin  8/20/2004  and  end  6/10/2005  unless  terminated  by  either 
party  with  a  10  day  written  notice.” 

35. 

In  October  2004,  Ms.  Silva  received  a  computer  print-out  from  the  District, 

entitled,  “2004-05  Notice  of  Employment  —  Current  Earnings.”  The  document  stated 
that  Ms.  Silva’s  employment  status  was  “temporary,”  and  that  her  seniority  date  was 
“9-24-2003.”"° 

  

'°  The  seniority  date  reflects  the  fact  that  Ms.  Silva  signed  her  temporary  contract  for  the  2004-05  school  year  on  or 
before  the  “official”  start  of  the  school  year  on  August  20,  2004;  thus,  she  was  not  considered  to  have  had  a  break  in 
service  from  her  prior  temporary  employment  with  the  District  during  the  2003-04  school  year,  pursuant  to  the 

14 

 

36. 

In  November  2004,  Ms.  Silva  received  a  notification  from  the  District,  dated 
November  16,  2004,  concerning  information  about  her  employment  status  and  credentials  as 
contained  in  the  District’s  computer  system.  The  notification  informed  Ms.  Silva  that  the 
District  considered  her  to  be  a  temporary  employee,  with  a  seniority  date  of  September  24, 
2003.  The  notification  further  stated  as  follows: 

...  The  seniority  date  is  your  date  of  hire  or  your  return  date  if  you 
resigned  and  were  later  rehired.  It  reflects  continual  contractual 
employment  with  San  Juan,  without  a  break  in  continuous  service. 

Please  review  the  information  ABOVE  and  BELOW  for  any  incorrect 
data.  This  data  will  be  used  to  determine  rights  in  the  event  of  Board 
reductions  or  layoffs.  Correct  any  data  errors  and  return  the  document 
to  the  Human  Resources  Department  (Attn:  Employee  Verification)  by 
January  7,  2005.  If  the  form  is  not  returned  with  corrections  by  this 
date,  Human  Resources  will  assume  that  the  information  provided 
herein  is  correct. 

Ms.  Silva  signed  the  form  on  December  12,  2004.  She  made  the  following 
corrections  on  the  form:  she  changed  her  seniority  date  from  “9/24/2003”  to  “8/02;”  and  she 
circled  “STATUS  —  TEMPORARY-10  PAY”  and  wrote,  “was  temp  past  year.  I  have  full 
CLAD  clear  credential.  Why  am  I  not  probationary?”  Ms.  Silva  turned  the  corrected  form  in 
to  the  District  in  January  2005, after  returning  from  winter  break.  When  she  did  not  hear 
back  from  the  District,  she  contacted  her  Union  representative,  Sandra  Galindo,  to  obtain 
assistance  in  clarifying  her  employment  status.  Ms. Galindo  sent  Ms.  Silva  an  e-mail  on 
February  10,  2005,  stating  as  follows: 

Molly, 

Sandra 

I  called  Human  Resources  to  find  out  your  status,  and  they  had  you 
down  as  “Temporary”  but  they  agreed  it  was  a  mistake.  I  let  them 
know  you  corrected  the  mistake  when  you  sent  in  your  form,  so  they 
said  the  district  is  just  falling  behind  in  making  corrections.  Call  again 
next  week  to  see  if  Jan  Gertz  or  whomever  you  corresponded  with  has 
corrected  your  status. 

If  they  have  not  let  me  know. 

In  a  follow-up  e-mail  to  Ms.  Silva  dated  February  11,  2005,  Ms.  Galindo  stated  as 

follows: 

  
District’s  practice of  calculating  seniority. 

15

I  spoke  to  Vivian,  but  she  is  just  my  contact.  She  did  her  checking  on 
the  computer  and  then  made  a  call  to  Jan  Gertz  or  whomever  you  were 
working  with.  Check  with  the  person  that  sent  you  the  form  that  you 
corrected.  If  you  need  my  help,  of  course,  call  or  email  me. 

Molly, 

Sandra 

37. 

The  District  contends  that  until  Ms.  Silva  appeared  in  the  Human  Resources 

Department  with  her  paperwork  demonstrating  completion  of  her  coursework  her  credential, 
she  was  not  authorized  by  the  District  to  render  services.  The  District  further  contends  that 
Ms.  Silva  lacked  the  appropriate  credentials  to  teach,  prior  to  submitting  the  C-19  Letter  of 
Issuance  to  the  District  on  August  19,  2004.  This  contention  is  not  supported  by  the 
District’s  records,  which  indicate  that  Ms.  Silva’s  emergency  credential  was  still  in  effect 
through  September  1,  2004. 

38. 

The  District  further  argued  that  August  20,  2004  was  the  first  official  teacher. 
work  day  of  the  2004-05  school  year,  as  negotiated  between  the  District  and  the  Union,  and 
Ms.  Silva  has  not  yet  been  paid  for  the  staff  development  days  she  worked  on  August  18-19, 
2004.  This  argument  is  not  persuasive;  the  District  is  obligated  to  pay  Ms.  Silva  for  the  two 
staff  development  days  pursuant  to  the  December  9,  2004  agreement  between  the  District  and 
the  Union. 

39.  |  Respondents  contend  that,  consistent  with  the  holding  in  Kavanaugh  v.  West 

Sonoma  County  High  School  District  (2003)  29  Cal.4th  911,  Ms.  Silva  must  be  deemed  a 
probationary  employee  of  the  District  because  she  commenced  paid  service  to  the  District  for 
the  2004-05  school  year  prior  to  receiving  notice  of  her  salary  and  temporary  employment 
status.  This  argument  is  persuasive.  As  the  Supreme  Court  stated  in  Kavanaugh: 

Section  44916  [of  the  Education  Code]  thus  mandates  that  a  school 
district  comply  with  three  requirements  if  it  desires  to  hire  a  “new 
certificated  employee”  (such  as  plaintiff  Kavanaugh)  as  a  temporary 
employee:  it  must  (a)  notify  the  employee  of  his  or  her  salary  and  status 
_as  a  temporary  employee;  (b)  do  so  in  a  written  notice;  and  (c)  give 
such  notice  “at  the  time  of  initial  employment.”  (/d.,  at  p.  919) 

The  Kavanaugh  court  concluded,  “Reading  section  44916  to  mean  that  certificated 

teachers  must  be  informed  in  writing,  on  or  before  their  first  day  of  paid  service  to  their 
employing  districts,  of  their  salary  and  employment  status  is  thus  consistent  with  the  apparent 
purpose  of  the  statute.”  (/d.,  at  p.  921)  In  this  case,  Ms.  Silva  rendered  two  days  of  paid 
service  to  the  District  before  she  was  presented  with  written  notification  of  her  salary  and 
employment  status;  thus,  she  must  be  deemed  a  probationary  employee  of  the  District,  with  a 
seniority  date  of  09/24/03. 

16 

   

40. 

Ms  Silva  did  not  receive  a  March  15  Notice,  and  therefore  must  be  retained  by 

the  District  for  the  ensuing  school  year,  pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44949. 
Moreover,  there  are  permanent  teachers  who  hold  Multiple  Subject  credentials  (the 
appropriate  credential  to  teach  in  Ms.  Silva’s  middle  school  position)  that  are  identified  for 
layoff,  Therefore,  one  full-time  (1.0  FTE)  position  should  be  saved  from  layoff.  The  most 
senior  permanent  employee  with  a  Multiple  Subject  teaching  credential  who  is  being  laid  off 
is  Karen  Rinde,  (seniority  date  11/15/01).  However,  Ms.  Rinde  is  only  being  laid  off  as  to  30 
percent  of  her  position  (.30  FTE),  because  the  District  has  her.  “bumping”  a  junior  employee 
for  the  remaining  .70  FTE.  Therefore,  Ms:  Rinde  should  be  retained  for  an  additional  .30 
FTE,  and  she  should  not  be  laid  off  for  the  ensuing  school  year.  The  next  most  senior  teacher 
with  a  Multiple  Subject  credential  is  Carla  Elkins,  also  with  a  seniority  date  of  11/15/01." 
Ms.  Elkins  is  being  laid  off  for  1.0  FTE.  Therefore,  she  should  only  be  laid  off  for  .30  FTE 
of  her  position,  and  retained  for  .70  FTE. 

Correction  of Seniority  Dates/Status 

41. 

Barbara  Harris, 

The  parties  stipulated  that  Barbara  Harris’  date  of  hire  is 

January  15,  2003,  and  her  status  is  probationary,  rather  than  permanent. 

42. 

Mirna  Jope.  Mirna  Jope  is  a  permanent  employee  of  the  District.  The  parties 

stipulated  that  her  seniority  date is  03/23/96.'” 

43. 

Marcy  Alexander.  Marcy  Alexander  is  a  probationary  employee  of  the 

District.  According  to  the  District’s  records,  Ms.  Alexander’s  seniority  date  is  08/20/01.  She 
has  not  attained  permanent  status  with  the  District  because  she  is  a  district  intern.  Ms. 
Alexander  attended  “Success  for  All,”  an  intervention  reading  program,  for  two  or  three  days, 
beginning  on  August  13,  2001.  This  was  a  required  training  course  before  she  could  begin 
her  regular  teaching  assignment  for  the  2001-02  school  year.  She  worked  under  a  temporary 
contract  for  the  2001-02  school  year,  beginning  on  August  20,  2001.  She  believed  when  she 
began  the  course  that  she  was  being  compensated  for  attending  the  course  as  part  of  her 
regular  salary;  she  was  surprised  when  she  received  payment  for  the  hours  worked  as  an 
“additional  assignment.”  At  the  time  Ms.  Alexander  commenced  work  for  the  District  during 
the  2001-02  school  year,  she  had  not  received  written  notification  from  the  District 
concerning  her  salary  and  employment  status.  Consequently,  under  the  rationale  of 
Kavanaugh,  supra,  her  seniority  date  shall  be  corrected  to  08/13/01,  the  date  on  which  she 
first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  District  in  a  probationary  position. 

44. 

Sonia  Takanikos.  Sonia  Takanikos is  a  permanent  employee  of  the  District. 
According  to  the  District’s  records,  Ms.  Takanikos’  seniority  date is  08/20/04.  Like  Molly 
McFarland-Silva,  Ms.  Takanikos  attended  the  two-day  staff  development  training  at 

  

"!  Ms.  Rinde  has  more  seniority  than  Ms.  Elkins  because  she  possesses  a  Supplemental  Authorization  to  teach  Home 
Economics, 
"  The  Accusation  against  Ms.  J ope  was  dismissed  by  the  District  in  its  April  12,  2005  Motion  to  Dismiss  Accusation 
as  to  Certain  Respondents. 

17 

 

Churchill  Middle  School  on  August  18-19,  2004.  She  signed  her  employment  contract  with 
the  District  in  July  of  2004;  the  contract  stated  that  she  was  being  employed  as  a  temporary 
employee,  commencing  August  20,  2004.  Ms.  Takanikos  is  entitled  to  payment  for  attending 
the  staff  development  days  on  August  18-19,  2004,  prior  to  the  start  of  her  temporary 
contract.  However,  unlike  Ms.  Silva,  at  the  time  Ms.  Takanikos  commenced  work  for  the 
District  during  the  2004-05  school  year,  she  had  received  written  notification  from  the 
District  concerning  her  salary  and  employment  status.  Thus,  the  rationale  of  Kavanaugh 
does  not  apply;  under  the  District’s  definition  of  seniority  as  the  first  date  in  paid  service 
under  contract  without  a  break  in  service,  her  seniority  date  shall  remain  08/20/04,  the  date 
on  which  her  contract  with  the  District  went  into  effect. 

45. 

Annette  Bell.  Annette  Bell  is  a  probationary  employee  of  the  District. 

According  to  the  District’s  records,  Ms.  Bell’s  seniority  date  is  10/15/03.  Ms.  Bell 
commenced  her  employment  with  the  District  for  the  2003-04  school  year  as  a  substitute,  or 
“guest”  teacher.  She  clearly  understood  that  she  was  being  employed  as  a  “guest”  teacher, 
which  she  believed  was  an  “independent  contractor”  and  not  an  “employee”  of  the  District. 
The  District’s  handbook  for  substitute  teachers  states  in  part  as  follows: 

2. 

As  a  Guest  Teacher  properly  certified,  you  may  be 
. 
recommended  for a  full  time  contracted  position.  You  must  sign 
an  Offer  of  Employment  Contract  before  the  contract  takes 
affect  [sic].  Services  prior  to  the  signing  of  the  contract  will  be 
at  the  Guest  Teacher  rate  of  pay.  There  are  no  retroactive 
appointments. 

Ms.  Bell  worked  as  a  day-to-day  substitute  teacher  through  September  8,  2003.  In 

September  2003,  Ms.  Bell  interviewed  for  an  English  Language  Learner  (ELL)  math  position 
at  Jonas  Salk  Elementary  School.  Because  Ms.  Bell  was  not  credentialed  to  teach 
mathematics,  she  was  told  to  go  to  the  District’s  Human  Resources  office  and  complete  the 
paperwork  to  obtain  a  Limited  Assignment  Teaching  Permit  (LATP).  One  of  the 
requirements  for  obtaining  the  LATP  is  that,  “Applicant  must  be  currently  employed  by  the 
employing  agency  requesting  such  assignment.”  Based  on  this  language,  Ms.  Bell  assumed 
she  was  no  longer  a  “guest”  teacher,  but  rather  was  an  “employee”  of  the  District,  at  the  time 
she  applied  for  the  LATP.  Ms.  Bell  underwent  training  on  September  11,  2003,  and  she 
began  teaching  in  the  position  at  Jonas  Salk  on  September  12,  2003.  Ms.  Bell  asked  a 
substitute  school  secretary  at  Jonas  Salk  when  she  would  be  given  a  contract  or  if  the  LATP 
application  “was  it.”  She  was  told  that  her  status  would  be  clarified  through  paperwork  at  a 
later  time.  Ms.  Bell  filled  out  a  timesheet  for  K-12  Guest  Teachers  on  September  25,  2003, 
for  her  work  from  August  26,  2003,  to  September  25,  2003.  On  or  about  Friday,  October  3, 
2003,  Ms.  Bell  was  informed  that  the  math  position  at  Jonas  Salk  was  being  given  to  another 
teacher,  and  that  she  was  being  placed  at  a  different  school  site.  On  Monday,  October  6, 
2003,  she  was  assigned  to  teach  at  Carnegie  Middle  School.  In  mid-October  2003,  Ms.  Bell 
was  contacted  by  Jan  Gertz,  Personnel  Technician,  to  come  to  the  District  office  to  sign  a 
contract.  She  was  given  a  temporary  contract  for  the  remainder  of  the  2003-04  school  year, 

- 

18

with  a  contract  date  of  October  15,  2003.  She  filled  out  a  timesheet  for  K-12  Guest  Teachers 
on  October  15,  2003,  for  her  work  from  September  26,  2003  to  October  14,  2003. 

Ms.  Bell  testified  that  she  felt  like  she  was  “kicked  in  the  gut”  when  she  saw  the 

October  15,  2003  date  on  her  temporary  employment  contract  with  the  District.  However, 
the  evidence  did  not  establish  that  Ms.  Bell  contested  the  contract  date  at  any  time  prior  to 
this  layoff  hearing  in  2005.  She  did  not  dispute  her  seniority  date  in  December  of  2004, 
when  the  District  sent  out  the  notices  to  employees  to  correct  errors  in  status  or  credentials  as 
reflected  in  District  records.  She  was  not  told  by  any  employee  in  the  Human  Resources 
office  that  her  contract  would’be  back-dated  to  the  date  she  applied  for  the  LATP.  District 
records  reflect  that  she  was  a  long-term  substitute  teacher  from  September  12,  2003  to 
October  14,  2003.  The  LATP  application  did  not  alter  her  status  as  a  substitute  teacher. 
Under  all  of  the  facts  and  circumstances  herein,  the  District’s  computation  of  Ms.  Bell’s 
seniority  date  is  proper,  and  does  not  require  correction. 

Other  Matters 

46.  _  Except  as  noted  above,  No  permanent or  probationary  certificated  employee 

junior  to  respondents  is  being  retained  to  perform  a  service  which  respondents  are  certificated 
and  competent  to  render.  Those  certificated  employees  junior  to  respondents  being  retained 
will  provide  services  which  respondents  are  not  certificated  and  competent  to  perform. 

47. 

The  services  identified  in  the  Governing  Board  Resolution  are  particular  kinds 

of  services  that  can  be  reduced  under  Education  Code  section  44955.  The  Governing 
Board’s  decision  to  reduce  the  identified  services  was  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  and 
was  a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion. 

. 

48. 

The  reduction  of  the  particular  kinds  of  services,  and  the  resultant  reduction  in 

173.43  FTE  certificated  positions  is  for  the  welfare  of  the  District  and  the  pupils.  The 
decision  was  made  because  of  a  variety  of  factors  affecting  the  District  including  the  State 
budget  crises  with  the  resultant  possible  loss  of  revenue  from  the  State,  a'decline  in 
enrollment  and  loss  of  funding  for  some  programs.  The  District  will  save  money  as  a  result 
of  the  reduction  in  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  reduction  in  particular  kinds  of  services 
is  the  sole  cause  for  not  re-employing  respondents. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

Prior  Rulings 

1, 

The  administrative  law  judge  ruled  on  the  following  issues,  either  at  the  April 

12,  2005  PHC,  or  during  the  hearing: 

19

“Precedential”  Decisions 

2. 

On  January  27,  2004,  in  Resolution  No.  2297,  the  Governing  Board  adopted  as 

a  “Precedential  Decision,”  pursuant  to  Government  Code  section  11425.60,  the  proposed 
decision  of  Presiding  Administrative  Law  Judge  Jaime  René  Roman,  adopted  by  the 
Governing  Board  on  May  13,  2003.  Ata  PHC  on  April  16,  2004,  Administrative  Law  Judge 
M.  Amanda  Behe  ruled  that  the  Governing  Board  lacked  the  authority  under  Government 
Code  section  11425.60  to  enact  a  precedential  decision,  in  that  the  California  Board  of 
Education,  rather  than  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  (or  any  other  individual  school 
district  or  county  office  of  education)  is  the  “agency”  authorized  to  interpret  the  Education 
Code,  and  thereby  make  law  and  policy  from  adjudication  as  well  as  rulemaking.  Judge 
Behe’s  ruling  was  affirmed  by  Administrative  Law  Judge  Leonard  L.  Scott  during  the  layoff 
hearing  on  April  21-22,  2004.  Effective  May  12,  2004,  the  Governing  Board  adopted  the 
proposed  decision  of  Judge  Scott,  as  amended;  the  amended  decision  rejected  the  rulings  of 
Judge  Behe  and  Judge  Scott,  and  adopted  the  May  2004  layoff  decision  as  “Precedential.” 
The  Governing  Board’s  decision  was  not  appealed. 

3, 

At  hearing,  the  District  asserted  that  the  2003  and  2004  “Precedential 

Decisions”  were  binding  on  the  parties  and  on  the  administrative  law  judge  with  respect  to 
issues  previously  addressed  in  said  decisions,  such  as  the  District’s  method  of  assigning 
seniority  dates.  The  District’s  argument  was  rejected  as  a  matter  of  law.  Although  not 
binding  on  the  administrative  law  judge  in  this  proceeding,  the  rationale  of  Judge  Behe’s 
ruling  at  the  April  16,  2004  PHC  is  persuasive.  The  Governing  Board  does  not  have  the 
authority  under  Government  Code  section  11425.60  to  adopt  layoff  decisions  as 
“Precedential,”  for  the  reasons  set  forth  in  Judge  Behe’s  April  16,  2004  ruling;  thus,  the 
ability  of  the  administrative  law  judge  to  make  rulings  in  this  proceeding  is  not  limited  by  the 
Governing  Board’s  2003  and  2004  layoff  decisions.  However,  the  administrative  law  judge 
is  not  precluded  from  considering  the  rulings  made  in  prior  layoff  decisions,  as  well  as  the 
fact  that  those  decisions  were  not  appealed,  in  determining  the  issues  in  this  proceeding. 

Status  of  Temporary  Employees 

4. 

When  counsel  for  respondents  filed  the  Notice  of  Defense  on  March  30,  2005, 

it  listed  the  following  certificated  employees,  who  were  classified  as  “temporary”  by  the 
District:  Jeffrey  Allen,  Elizabeth  Austin,  Gerell  Elliott,  Marcia  Garrett,  Tamaryn  Goin, 
Richard  Hale,  Tania  Love,  Rocco  Marrongelli,  Molly  McFarland-Silva,  Robert  Meng,  Luke 
Mullinsen,  Tamela  Navarro,  Melissa  Oates,  Larry  Patterson,  Jr.,  Brian  Quale,  Phetsavane 
Sayasy,  William  Wade  Smith,  Robyn  Soliman,  and  Gina  Williams.  These  employees  had  not 
been  served  with  the  March  15  Notice  or  the  Accusation.  At  the  April  12,  2005  PHC,  the 
District  brought  a  motion  in  limine  to  prevent  respondents  from  asserting  that  these 
employees  were  misidentified  as  temporary  employees,  and  should  have  been  classified  as 
probationary.  The  administrative  law  judge  ruled  that  these  employees  were  notified  of  their 
temporary  status  in  September  2004,  and  again  in  November  2004.  The  District  relied  on  the 
known  probationary  and  permanent  status  of  employees  as  reflected  in  the  District’s  records 
in  identifying  employees  to  be  given  layoff  notices.  The  District  would  be  prejudiced  if  the 

  

 

individuals  were  now  allowed  to  assert  their  status  as  probationary  employees,  in  that  the 
time  fore  issuing  March  15  Notice  of  intended  layoff  has  passed.  To  the  extent  that  these 
employees  did  not  give  prior  notice  to  the  District  that  they  were  challenging  their  status  as 
temporary  employees,  they  were  barred  by  the  equitable  doctrine  of  laches  from  raising  the 
issue  of  their  alleged  probationary  status  after  the  March  15  Notice  was  issued.  One 
employee,  Molly  McFarland-Silva,  did  raise  the  question  of  her  temporary  status  in  January 
2005,  well  before  the  issuance  of  the  March  15  Notice  (see  Finding  36).  The  District  was 
therefore  on  notice  that  her  status  was  in  dispute,  and  could  have  issued  a  precautionary 
layoff notice  to  her.  Consequently,  Ms.  Silva  was  permitted  to  participate  in  the  hearing,  in 
order  to  challenge  her  temporary  status.  Except  as  to  Ms  Silva,  the  motion  in  limine  was 
granted. 

District’s  Calculation  of  Seniority  Dates 

5, 

Respondents  challenged  the  District’s  calculation  of  seniority  date  as  “first 

date  in  paid  service  under  contract  without  a  break  in  service.”  The  administrative  law  judge 
ruled  at  hearing  that  this  is  a  long-standing  practice  of  the  District,  which  has  been  upheld  in 
prior  layoff  decisions..  It  was  specifically  raised  as  an  issue  in  the  2004  layoff  hearings.  It  is 
not  clearly  erroneous.  It  is  the  District’s  practice  to  inform  employees  at  the  start  of  the 
school  year  of  their  seniority  date  and  status  as  a  substitute,  temporary,  probationary,  or 
‘permanent  employee,  and  to  again  notify  employees  of  their  status  each  November  or 
December.  Under  the  circumstances,  the  failure  to  challenge  the  District’s  method  of  * 
determining  seniority  prior  to  the  layoff  hearing,  after  notices  have  been  issued  to  affected 
certificated  employees,  is  prejudicial  to  the  District,  and  respondents  are  barred  by  laches 
from  raising  the  issue  at  the  hearing.  Respondents  were  permitted  to  submit  a  written  offer  of 
proof  concerning  this  issue. 

District’s  Employment  of  Substitute/“Guest”  Teachers 

6. 

Respondents  challenged  the  District’s  practice  of  initially  hiring  employees  to 

fill  vacant  positions  as  “substitute”  or  “guest”  teachers,  instead  of  as  temporary  teachers,  with 
the  result  that  their  service  for  the  District  prior  to  signing  a  temporary  contract  constitutes  a 
“break  in  service”  for  purposes  of  calculating  seniority.  Respondents  contended  that 
Education  Code  section  44916,  and  the  case  of  Kavanaugh  v.  West  Sonoma  County  Union 
High  School  District,  supra,  require  that  employees  in  this  situation  should  be  deemed 
probationary,  and  that  their  seniority  date  should  be  calculated  as  the  date  they  first  rendered 
paid  service  to  the  District  as  a  “substitute”  teacher.  The  administrative  law  judge  ruled  that 
the  use  of  substitute  teachers  at  the  start  of  the-school  year  is  a  long-standing  practice  of  the 
District,  and  the  general  issue  of  employment  of  substitute  teachers  in  vacant  positions  is 
beyond  the  scope  of  this  layoff  proceeding,  Furthermore,  the  status  of  teachers  hired  as 
substitute  or  guest  teachers  is  known  to  those  teachers;  thus  the  underlying  rationale  of 
Kavanaugh  does  not  apply,  in  that  the  teachers  were  not  misled  about  their  status  as  either 
substitute  or  temporary  employees.  Respondents  were  permitted  to  submit  a  written  offer  of 
proof  concerning  this  issue. 

 

Applicable  Statutes  and  Case  Law 

7. 

Education  Code  section  44949  provides: 

(a)  No  later  than  March  15  and  before  an  employee  is  given  notice  by 
the  governing  board  that  his  or  her  services  will  not  be  required  for  the 
ensuing  year  for  the  reasons  specified  in  Section  44955,  the  governing 
board  and  the  employee  shall  be  given  written  notice  by  the 
superintendent  of  the  district  or  his  or  her  designee,  or  in  the  case  of  a 
district  which  has  no  superintendent  by  the  clerk  or  secretary  of  the 
governing  board,  that  it  has  been  recommended  that  the  notice  be  given 
to  the  employee,  and  stating  the  reasons  therefor. 

Until  the  employee  has  requested  a  hearing  as  provided  in  subdivision 
(b)  or  has  waived  his  or  her  right  to  a  hearing,  the  notice  and  the 
reasons  therefor  shall  be  confidential  and  shall  not  be  divulged  by  any 
person,  except  as  may  be  necessary  in  the  performance  of  duties. 
However,  the  violation  of this  requirement  of  confidentiality,  in  and  of 
itself,  shall  not  in  any  manner  be  construed  as  affecting  the validity  of 
any  hearing  conducted  pursuant  to  this  section. 

(b)  The  employee  may  request  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause 
for  not  reemploying  him  or  her  for  the  ensuing  year.  A  request  for.a 
hearing  shall  be  in  writing  and  shall  be  delivered  to  the  person  who  sent 
the  notice  pursuant  to  subdivision  (a),  on  or  before  a  date  specified  in 
that  subdivision,  which  shall  not  be  less  than  seven  days  after  the  date 
on  which  the  notice  is  served  upon  the  employee.  If  an  employee  fails 
to  request  a  hearing  on  or  before  the  date  specified,  his  or  her  failure  to 
do  so  shall  constitute  his  or  her  waiver  of  his  or  her  right  to  a  hearing. 
The  notice  provided  for  in  subdivision  (a)  shall  advise  the  employee  of 
the  provisions  of  this  subdivision. 

(c)  In  the  event  a  hearing  is  requested  by  the  employee,  the  proceeding 
shall  be  conducted  and  a  decision  made  in  accordance  with  Chapter  5 
(commencing  with  Section  11500)  of  Part  1  of  Division  3  of  Title  2  of 
the  Government  Code  and  the  governing  board  shall  have  all  the  power 
granted  to  an  agency  therein,  except  that  all  of  the  following  shall 
apply: 

(1)  The  respondent  shall  file  his  or  her  notice  of  defense,  if  any,  within 
five  days  after  service  upon  him  or  her  of  the  accusation  and  he  or  she 
shall  be  notified  of  this  five-day  period  for  filing  in  the  accusation. 

(2)  The  discovery  authorized  by  Section  11507.6  of  the  Government 
Code  shall  be  available  only  if  request  is  made  therefor  within  15  days

after  service  of  the  accusation,  and  the  notice  required  by  Section 
11505  of  the  Government  Code  shall  so  indicate. 

(3)  The  hearing  shall  be  conducted  by  an  administrative  law  judge  who 
shall  prepare  a  proposed  decision,  containing  findings  of  fact  and  a 
determination  as  to  whether  the  charges  sustained  by  the  evidence  are 
related  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof.  The 
proposed  decision  shall  be  prepared  for  the  governing  board  and  shall 
contain  a  determination  as  to  the  sufficiency  of  the  cause  and  a 
recommendation  as  to  disposition.  However,  the  governing  board  shall 
make  the  final  determination  as  to  the  sufficiency  of  the  cause  and 
disposition.  None  of  the  findings,  recommendations,  or  determinations 
contained  in  the  proposed  decision  prepared  by  the  administrative  law 
judge  shall  be  binding  on  the  governing  board.  Nonsubstantive 
procedural  errors  committed  by  the  school  district  or  governing  board 
of  the  school  district  shall  not  constitute  cause  for  dismissing  the 
charges  unless  the  errors  are  prejudicial  errors.  Copies  of  the  proposed 
decision  shall  be  submitted  to  the  governing  board  and  to  the  ernployee 
on  or  before  May  7  of  the  year  in  which  the  proceeding  is  commenced. 
All  expenses  of  the  hearing,  including  the  cost  of  the  administrative  law 
judge,  shall  be  paid  by  the  governing  board  from  the  district  funds. 

The  board  may  adopt  from  time  to  time  such  rules  and  procedures  not 
inconsistent  with  provisions  of  this  section  as  may  be  necessary  to 
effectuate  this  section. 

(d)  Any  notice  or  request  shall  be  deemed  sufficient  when  it  is 
delivered  in  person  to  the  employee  to  whom  it  is  directed,  or  when  it  is 
deposited  in  the  United  States  registered  mail,  postage  prepaid  and 
addressed  to  the  last  known  address  of  the  employee. 

(e)  If  after  request  for  hearing  pursuant  to  subdivision  (b)  any 
continuance  is  granted  pursuant  to  Section  11524  of  the  Government 
Code,  the  dates  prescribed  in  subdivision  (c)  which  occur  on  or  after 
the  date  of  granting  the  continuance  and  the  date  prescribed  in 
subdivision  (c)  of  Section  44955  which  occurs  after  the  date  of  granting 
the  continuance  shall  be  extended  for  a  period  of  time  equal  to  the 
continuance. 

Education  Code  section  44955  provides  in  relevant  part: 

(a)  No  permanent  employee  shall  be  deprived  of  his  or  her  position  for 
causes  other  than  those  specified  in  Sections  44907  and  44923,  and 
Sections  44932  to  44947,  inclusive,  and  no  probationary  employee 

23 

 

shall  be  deprived  of  his  or  her  position  for  cause  other  than  as  specified 
in  Sections  44948  to  44949,  inclusive. 

(b)  Whenever  in  any  school  year  the  average  daily  attendance  in  all  of 
the  schools  of  a  district  for  the  first  six  months  in  which  school  is  in 
session  shall  have  declined  below  the  corresponding  period  of  either  of 
the  previous  two  school  years,  whenever  the  governing  board 
determines  that  attendance  in  a  district  will  decline  in  the  following 
year  as  a  result  of  the  termination  of  an  interdistrict  tuition  agreement 
as  defined  in  Section  46304,  whenever  a  particular  kind  of  service  is  to 
be  reduced  or  discontinued  not  later  than  the  beginning  of  the  following 
school  year,  or  whenever  the  amendment  of  state  law  requires  the 
modification  of  curriculum,  and  when  in  the  opinion  of  the  governing 
board  of  the  district  it  shall  have  become  necessary  by  reason  of  any  of 
these  conditions  to  decrease  the  number  of  permanent  employees  in  the 
district,  the  governing  board  may  terminate  the  services  of  not  more 
than  a  corresponding  percentage  of  the  certificated  employees  of  the 
district,  permanent  as  well  as  probationary,  at  the  close  of  the  school 
year.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  statute,  the  services  of  no 
permanent  employee  may  be  terminated  under  the  provisions  of  this 
section  while  any  probationary  employee,  or  any  other  employee  with 
less  seniority,  is  retained  to  render  a  service  which  said  permanent 
employee is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

In  computing  a  decline  in  average  daily  attendance  for  purposes  of  this 
section  for  a  newly  formed  or  reorganized  school  district,  each  school 
of  the  district  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  a  school  of  the  newly 
formed  or  reorganized  district  for  both  of  the  two  previous  school 
years. 

   

As  between  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  district  on 
the  same  date,  the  governing  board  shall  determine  the  order  of 
termination  solely  on  the  basis  of  needs  of  the  district  and  the  students 
thereof.  Upon  the  request  of  any  employee  whose  order  of  termination 
is  so  determined,  the  governing  board  shall  furnish  in  writing  no  later 
than  five  days  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  hearing  held  in 
accordance  with  Section  44949,  a  statement  of  the  specific  criteria  used 
in  determining  the  order  of  termination  and  the  application  of  the 
criteria  in  ranking  each  employee  relative  to  the  other  employees  in  the 
group.  This  requirement  that  the  governing  board  provide,  on  request, 
a  written  statement  of  reasons  for  determining  the  order  of  termination 
shall  not  be  interpreted  to  give  affected  employees  any  legal  right  or 
interest  that  would  not  exist  without  such  a  requirement. 

24 

(c)  Notice  of  such  termination  of  services  shall  be  given  before  the  15th 
of  May  in  the  manner  prescribed  in  Section  44949,  and  services  of  such 
employees  shall  be  terminated  in  the  inverse  of  the  order  in  which  they 
were  employed,  as  determined  by  the  board  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions  of  Sections  44844  and  44845.  In  the  event  that  a  permanent 
or  probationary  employee  is  not  given  the  notices  and  a  right  to  a 
hearing  as  provided  for  in  Section  44949,  he  or  she  shall  be  deemed 
reemployed  for  the  ensuing  school  year. 

The  governing  board  shall  make  assignments  and  reassignments  in  such 
a  manner  that  employees  shall  be  retained  to  render  any  service  which 
their  seniority  and qualifications  entitle  them  to  render.  However,  prior 
to  assigning  or  reassigning  any  certificated  employee  to  teach  a  subject 
which  he  or  she  has  not  previously  taught,  and  for  which  he  or  she  does 
not  have  a  teaching  credential  or  which  is  not  within  the  employee's 
major  area  of  postsecondary  study  or  the  equivalent  thereof,  the 
governing  board  shall  require  the  employee  to  pass  a  subject  matter 
competency  test  in  the  appropriate  subject. 

(d)  Notwithstanding  subdivision  (b),  a  school  district  may  deviate  from 
terminating  a  certificated  employee  in  order  of  seniority  for  éither  of 
the  following  reasons: 

(1)  The  district  demonstrates  a  specific  need  for  personnel  to  teach  a 
specific  course  or  course  of  study,  or  to  provide  services  authorized  by 
a  services  credential  with  a  specialization  in  either  pupil  personnel 
services  or  health  for  a  school  nurse,  and  that  the  certificated  employee 
has  special  training  and  experience  necessary  to  teach  that  course  or 
course  of  study  or  to  provide  those  services,  which  others  with  more 
seniority  do  not  possess. 

Education  Code  section  44956,  subdivision  (a)(1),  provides: 

(a)  Any  permanent  employee  whose  services  have  been  terminated  as 
provided  in  Section  44955  shall  have  the  following  rights: 

(1)  For  the  period  of  39  months  from  the  date  of  such  termination,  any 
employee  who  in  the  meantime  has  not  attained  the  age  of  65  years 
shall  have  the  preferred  right  to  reappointment,  in  the  order  of  original 
employment  as  determined by  the  board  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions  of  Sections  44831  to  44855,  inclusive,  if  the  number  of 
employees  is  increased  or  the  discontinued  service  is  reestablished, 
with  no  requirements  that  were  not  imposed  upon  other  employees  who 
continued  in  service;  provided,  that  no  probationary  or  other  employee 
with  less  seniority  shall  be  employed  to  render  a  service  which  said 

25

employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render.  However,  prior  to 
reappointing  any  employee  to  teach  a  subject  which  he  or  she  has  not 

'  previously  taught,  and  for  which  he  or  she  does  not  have  a  teaching 

credential  or  which  is  not  within  the  employee's  major  area  of 
postsecondary  study  or  the  equivalent  thereof,  the  governing  board 
shall  require  the  employee  to  pass  a  subject  matter  competency  test  in 
the  appropriate  subject. 

10. 

The  Governing  Board  may  reduce,  discontinue  or  eliminate  a  particular  kind  of 

service  and  then  provide  the  needed  services  to  the  students  in  another  manner,  see  Gallup  v. 
Board  of  Trustees  (1996)  41  Cal.App.4th  1571,  and  California  Teachers  Association  v. 
Board of  Trustees  of  Goleta  Union  School Dist.  (1982)  132  Cal.App.3d  32. 

11. 

In  the  course  of  reducing,  discontinuing  or  eliminating  a  particular  kind  of 
service,  the  Governing  Board  may  retain  certificated  employees  junior  to  respondent/s  to 
perform  services  which  respondent/s  is/are  not  certificated  and  competent  to  render,  see 
Moreland  Teachers  Association  v.  Kruse  (1980)  109  Cal.App.3d  648,  and  Levin  v.  Board  of 
Trustees  (1976)  62  Cal.App.3d  977.

A  school  board  may  reduce  services  within  the  meaning  of  statute  either  by 

determining  that  a  certain  type  of  service  shall  not  be  performed  at  all  or  by  reducing  the 
number  of  district  employees  who  perform  such  services.  Rutherford  v.  Board  of  Trustees  of 
Bellflower  Unified  School  District  (1976)  64  Cal.App.3d  167.

13. 

A  senior  teacher  whose  position  is  discontinued  has  the  right  to  transfer  to  a 

continuing  position  which  he  or  she  is  certificated  and  competent  to  fill. 
In  doing  so,  the 
senior  employee  may  displace  or  “bump”  a  junior  employee  who  is  filling  that  position. 
Lacy  y.  Richmond  Unified  School  District  (1975)  13  Cal.3d  469.  Junior  teachers  may  be 
given  retention  priority  over  senior  teachers  if  the  junior  teachers  possess  superior  skills  or 
capabilities  which  their  more  senior  counterparts  lack.  Poppers  v.  Tilapias  Union  High 
School  District  (1986)  184  Cal.App.3d  399;  Santa  Clara  Federation  of  Teachers,  Local

Hearing  Issues 

14. 

-As  set  forth  in  F indings  13  and  14,  Colleen  Kelly  and  Richard  Myers  are 

excused from  the  late  submission  of  their  requests  for  hearing,  and  they  are  entitled  to 
participate  as  respondents  in  these  proceedings. 

15. 

As  set  forth  in  Findings  12  and  15,  Kristin  Edington  and  Zachary  Lovell 

waived  their  rights  to  a  hearing  by  their  unexcused  failure  to  submit  a  timely  request  for 
hearing,  and  they  are  not  respondents  in  this  matter. 

 

16. 

As  set  forth  in  Finding  24,  respondent  Stephanie  Floyd-Smuth  is  not  entitled  to 
be  retained  by  the  District  to  teach  special  education,  and  the  District  is  not  obligated  to  seek 
an  emergency  credential  on  her  behalf  to  allow  her  to  do  so. 

As  set  forth  in  Findings  25-27,  the  District  properly  identified  all  counselor 

17. 

positions  in  the  District  as  being  subject  to  layoff. 

18. 

By  reason  of  the  facts  set  forth  in  Finding  28,  respondent  Kenyan  Epps  shall 

be  retained  for  .80  FTE  of  his  position  as  a  sixth  grade  middle  school  science  teacher,  in  that 
his  position  was  improperly  identified  as  being  affected  by  the  PKS  reduction  in  7-12  Social 
Science,  and  the  District  did  not  establish  which,  if  any,  teacher  with  more  seniority  would 
have  the  right  to  “bump”  Mr.  Epps.  Mr.  Epps  shall  be  laid  off  .20  FTE. 

19. 

|  By  reason  of  the  facts  set  forth  in  Finding  30,  respondent  Tobias  Spencer  shall 
be  retained  in  .33  FTE  position,  in  that  he  is  the  most  senior  respondent  with  the  credentials 
and  qualifications  to  “bump”  Zachary  Lovell  from  his  .33  FTE  position  teaching  Health. 
Neither  of  the  teachers  identified  by  the  District  as  “bumping”  Mr.  Lovell  had  the  credentials 
and  qualifications  to  teach  Health. 

20. 

Byreason  of  the  facts  set  forth  in  Findings  31-40,  Molly  McFarland-Silva 

shall  be  designated  as  a  probationary  employee  of  the  District,  with  a  seniority  date  of 
09/24/03,  She  shall  be  retained  for  the  2005-06  school  year,  because  she  did  not  receive  a 
March  15  Notice.  In  addition,  Karen  Rinde  (who  is  currently  slated  to  be  laid  off  for  .30 
FTE)  shall  be  retained  for  an  additional  .30  FTE  (resulting  in  her  being  retained  for  the  2005- 
06  school  year),  and  Carla  Elkins  (who  is  currently  slated  to  be  laid  off  for  1.0  FTE)  shall  be 
retained  for  .70  FTE  (resulting  in  her  being  laid  off  for  .30  FTE)  ,  in  that  they  are  the  most 
senior  respondents  with  the  same  credentials  and  qualifications  as  Ms.  Silva  who  would  have 
been  eligible  to  “bump”  Ms.  Silva  from  her  teaching  position. 

Asset  forth  in  Finding  41,  Barbara  Harris’  seniority  date  is  01/15/03,  and  she 

is  Classified  as  probationary. 

As  set  forth  in  Finding  42,  Mirna  Jape’s  seniority  date  is  03/23/96. 

As  set  forth  in  Finding  43,  Marcy  Alexander’s  seniority  date  shall  be  changed 

All  other  arguments  of  the  parties  not  specifically  addressed  herein  were 

21. 

22. 

23. 

24. 

to  08/13/01. 

considered  and  are  rejected. 

Conclusion 

25. 

Jurisdiction  for  the  subject  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code 

sections  44949  and  44955.  All  notices  and  other  jurisdictional  requirements  of  those  sections 
have  been  met.

26. 

—  Cause  exists  for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  the  particular  kinds  of 

services  and  of  173.43  certificated  positions  at  the  end  of  the  2004-2005  school  year, 
pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  Therefore,  cause  exists  pursuant  to 
Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  to  give  notice  to  respondents  that  their  services
