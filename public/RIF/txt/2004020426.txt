4, 

On  March  9,  2004,  the  Board  adopted  a  resolution  recommending  a  reduction 

in  particular  kinds  of  services  provided  by  the  District  for  the  2004-2005  school  year,  as 
recommended  by  the  Superintendent  in  paragraph  3  above.  The  Board  directed  the 
Superintendent  to  give  Preliminary  Layoff  Notices  to  employees. 

5. 

Prior  to  March  15,  2003,  a  written  notice  of  termination  (hereinafter  referred  to 
as  “the  written  notice”)  was  delivered  to  each  Respondent,  either  by  personal  delivery  or  by 
depositing  the  notice  of  termination  in  the  United  States  registered  mail,  postage  prepaid  and 
addressed  to  the  Respondent’s  last  known  address.  The  written  notice  notified  respondents 
that  his  or  her  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  upcoming  2004-2005  school  year.  The 
written  notice  specifically  stated  that  each  of  the  Respondents’  services  would  not  be 
required  for  the  ensuing  year.  Each  notice  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation. 

Each  written  notice  advised  Respondents  they  each  had a  right  to  a  hearing,  each 
Respondent  had  to  deliver  a  request  for  a  hearing  in  writing  to  the  person  sending  the  notice 
of  termination  within  seven  days  after  the  notice  of  termination  was  served,  and  the  failure  to 
request  a  hearing  would  constitute  the  waiver  of  the  right  to  a  hearing.  Each  appearing 
Respondent  timely  filed  a  written  request  for  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  was  cause  for 
not  reemploying  that  Respondent  for  the  ensuing  year. 

6. 

Subsequently,  on  March  24,  2003,  the  Superintendent  filed  and  timely  served 
on  behalf  of  the  District  the  Accusation  herein  for  each  of  the  Respondents.  Rhoda  Barno 
and  Amanda  Consigli  did  not  file  a  Notice  of  Defense  in  response  to  the  Accusations  and 
therefore  are  deemed  to  have  waived  their  right  to  a  hearing.  Each  of  the  Respondents 
appearing  in  this  matter  filed  a  timely  Notice  of  Defense.  All  pre-hearing  jurisdictional 
requirements  were  met. 

The  Board’s  March  9,  2004  resolution  to  reduce  services  for  the  ensuing 

school  year  reduced  the  following  particular  kinds  of  services  for  the  2004-2005  school  year:

The  reductions  adopted  by  the  Board’s  resolution  on  March  9,  2004  totaled  84.06 

full-time  equivalent  (FTE)  positions. 

8. 

The  services  were  “particular  kinds  of  services”  that  could  be  reduced  or 

discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955.  The  Board’s  decision  to 
reduce  or  discontinue  these  particular  kinds  of  services  was  not  arbitrary  or  capricious,  but 
constituted  a  proper  and  reasonable  exercise  of  discretion.  The  Board’s  action  was  taken 
after  consideration  of  the  projected  budget  shortfall  for  the  ensuing  school  year.  It  is 
projected  that  the  District  must  reduce  its  budget  for  the  2004-2005  school  year  by 
approximately  1.7  to  2  million  dollars.  The  Board’s  action  to  reduce  services  is  a  proper 
exercise  of  its  discretion  to  address  projected  fiscal  shortages  for  the  2004-2005  school  year. 

9. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  is  related  to  the 
welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils.  The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of 
services  was  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  as 
determined  by  the  Board. 

10. 

|  Subsequent  to  the  action  the  Board  took  on  March  9,  2004  to  reduce  services 

by  84.06  FTE  positions,  the  District  continued  to  evaluate  its  personnel  needs.  Since  the 
Board’s  action,  the  District  has  terminated  all  of  its  temporary  teachers.  After  further 
evaluation  and  after  taking  into  consideration  upcoming  retirements,  the  District  has  now 
determined  it  can  meet  its  fiscal  needs  by  reducing  services  by  a  total  of  51.56  FTE  positions 
for  the  2004-2005  school  year.  To  accomplish  this  reduction  of  services,  the  District  needs 
to  give  final  notices  of  termination  to  the  13  respondents  now  remaining  in  this  proceeding. 

Nocertificated  employee  junior  to  any  Respondent  is  being  retained  to 
perform  any  services  which  any  Respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

11. 

 

12.  |  Some  junior  employees  with  specialized  training  who  were  hired  after  other 

more  senior  Respondents  are  being  retained  by  the  District.  However,  these  junior 
employees  are  credentialed  in  specialized  areas  such  as  special  education  or  bilingual 
education.  The  District  needs  personnel  to  teach  special  education  and  bilingual  education 
and  the  junior  employees  being  retained  have  the  special  training  and  experience  necessary 
to  teach  those  courses  of  study  which  others  with  more  seniority  do  not  possess.  In  addition, 
the  District  plans  to  assign  such  junior  employees  with  special  credentials,  training,  or 
experience  to  assignments  in  special  education  or  bilingual  education  in  the  next  school  year. 

13. 

|  Some  of  the  Respondents  began  their  service  with  the  District  on  the  same 
date.  Between  these  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  district  on  the  same 
date,  the  governing  board  determined  their  order  of  termination  on  the  basis  of  needs  of  the 
district  and  the  students.  The  specific  criteria  used  to  determine  the  order  of  termination  was 
set  forth  in  tie-breaking  criteria  adopted  by  the  Board.  The  criteria  were  fairly  applied  to 
rank  those  employees  hired  on  the  same  date. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

2. 

Jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 

44955.  All  notices  and  jurisdictional  requirements  contained  in  those  sections  were  satisfied. 

Cause  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  Cajon 

Valley  Union  School  District  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  cause 
for  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  is  related  solely  to  the 
welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof.  A  preponderance  of  the  evidence  sustained  the 
charges  set  forth  in  the  Accusations  herein.  Cause  exists  for  the  Board  to  give  Respondents 
notice  before  May  15,  2004,  that  their  services  will  no  longer  be  required  by  the  District  in 
the  ensuing  school  year.

  

ORDER 

The  Accusations  served  on  the  Respondents  are  sustained  and  notice  shall  be  given  to 

Respondents  Pamela  Buehl,  Michele  Harin,  Carrie  Ignacio,  Todd  Inouye,  Debra  Jordan, 
David  Larson,  Nicolle  McDaniel,  Sylvia  Oedevaldt,  Susan  Plack,  Shannon  Savinon,  Carrie 
Semik,  Darren  Smith,  and  Melanie  Wigley  before  May  15,  2004  that  their  services  will  not 
be  required  in  the  next  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular 
services  as  indicated.
