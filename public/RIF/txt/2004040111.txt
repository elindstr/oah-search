that  notice  be  given  them  that  their  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  school 
year.  The  written  notice  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation. 

6. 

Only  respondent  Marette  Myers  made  a  timely  request  in  writing  for  a  hearing

An  accusation  was  timely  served  on  respondent  Myers  and  Myers  filed  a 

timely  Notice  of  Defense. 

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met. 

8. 

9. 

Respondent  Marette  Myers  holds  a  Standard  Elementary  Life  Teaching 

Credential  and  a  Specially  Designed  Academic  Instruction  in  English  (SDAIE)  certificate. 
District  currently  employs  Myers  as  a  1.0  F.T.E.  Title  I  Reading  Specialist.  Myers’  position 
is  categorically  funded.  District  has  assigned  Myers  a  seniority  date  of  August  23,  2002,  and 
classifies  her  as  a  second  year  probationary  employee. 

10.  |  Myers  contends  she  should  have  an  earlier  seniority  date.  Myers  was 
originally  hired  by  District  in  1995  under  the  Miller-Unruh  Basic  Reading  Act  (Miller-Unruh

©} 

Act)  as  a  reading  specialist.  She  was  hired  as  a  temporary  employee.  Myers  was  rehired 
each  succeeding  year  as  a  reading  specialist  through  the  2003-2004  school  year  and  worked 
at  least  75  percent  of  the  school  year  each  year  of  her  employment.  Myers  was  classified  by 
District  as  a  temporary  employee  through  the  2002-2003  school  year. 

11. 

On  January  8,  2003,  District’s  Board  adopted  a  policy  that  provided  in 

pertinent  part: 

Any  person  classified  as  a  temporary  employee  and  employed  in  a 
categorically  funded  program,  which  is  not  required  by  federal  or  state 
Statute,  shall  attain  second  year  probationary  status  upon  satisfactory 
completion  of  the  equivalent  of  four  years  of  full-time  employment. 

The  Board  policy  further  provided  that  service  as  a  temporary  employee  would  only 

be  included  in  computing  service  toward  permanent  status  if  the  employee  served  pursuant  to 
the  policy  in  full-time  status  during  the  prior  school  year  and  the  employee  was  subsequently 
employed  as  a  full-time  probationary  teacher. 

Myers  had  successfully  served  as  a  full-time  temporary  employee  for  at  least  four 

years  prior  to  the  2003-2004  school  year  and  was  employed  as  a  reading  specialist  full-time 
during  the  2003-2004  school  year.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Board 
policy  District  classified  Myers  as  a  second  year  probationary  employee  for  the  2003-2004 
school  year.  Myers  was  assigned a  seniority  date  of  August  23,  2002,  which  represented  her 
first  date  of  paid  service  during  the  prior  2002-2003  school  year.

12. 

Myers  contends  that  pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44909  she  should 

have  a  seniority  date  of  August  23,  2001.  Education  Code  section  44909  provides  in 
pertinent  part: 

The  governing  board  of  any  school  district  may  employ  persons 
possessing  an  appropriate  credential  as  certificated  employees  in... 
categorically  funded  projects  which  are  not  required  by  federal  or  state 
statutes.  The  terms  and  conditions  under  which  such  persons  are 
employed  shall  be  mutually  agreed  upon  by  the  employee  and  the 
governing  board  and  such  agreement  shall  be  reduced  to  writing.  Service 
pursuant  to  this  section  shall  not  be  included  in  computing  the  service 
required  as  a  prerequisite  to  attainment  of,  or  eligibility  to,  classification 
as  a  permanent  employee  unless  (1)  such  person  has  served  pursuant  to 
this  section  for  at  least  75  percent  of  the  number  of  days  the  regular 
schools  of  the  district  by  which  he  is  employed  is  maintained  and  (2)  such 
person  is  subsequently  employed  as  a  probationary  employee  in  a  position 
requiring  certification  qualifications.  ..  .” 

@ 

Myers  contends  that  she  was  actually a  first  year  probationary  employee  during  the 

2002-2003  school  year  because  she  attained  second  year  probationary  status  during  the  2003-  

2004  school  year.  She  then  reasons  that  since  she  served  as  a  temporary  employee  of  District 
at  least  75  percent  of  the  prior  2001-2002  school  year  pursuant  to  Education  Code  section 
44909  her  service  during  the  2001-2002  school  year  should  be  credited  toward  her  eligibility 
for  permanent  status.  Under  this  analysis  Meyers  would  have  completed  probation  at  the  end 
of  the  2002-2003  school  year  and  would  be  entitled  to  a  seniority  date  that  is  one  year  earlier, 
1e.,  August  23,  2001.

Myers  contention  is  not  persuasive.  As  noted  by  District,  the  Board 

policy  does  not  grant  affected  employees  first  year  probationary  status.  Instead,  affected 
employees  remain  temporary  employees  until  they  attain  second  year  probationary  status 
by  fulfilling  the  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Board  policy.  Respondent  Myers  has  not  cited 
any  legal  authority  that  mandates  the  Board  grant  her  first  year  probationary  status. 
Moreover,  Education  Code  section  44909  provides  for  hiring  of  employees  into  non- 
mandated  categorically  funded  positions  under  terms  and  conditions  that  are  mutually  agreed 
upon  by  the  employee  and  the  governing  board.  It  is  undisputed  that  Myers  signed  a  contract 
for  the  2002-2003  school  year  in  which  she  was  classified  as  a  temporary  employee.  Lastly, 
it  is  worth  noting  that  Education  Code  section  44909  clearly  anticipates  only  one  year  of 
credit  for  service  as  a  temporary  employee.  If  Myers’  interpretation  were  adopted,  it  would 
permit  her  to  use  two  years  of  service  as  a  temporary  employee  as  probationary  service  and 
allow  her  to  avoid  actually  serving  any  probationary  period. 

14. 

Respondent  Myers  alternately  contends  that  she  should  have  been  granted 

probationary  status  when  she  was  hired  as  a  reading  specialist  under  the  Miller-Unruh  Act  in 
1995.  Myers  primarily  relies  on  Education  Code  section  54122  which  provides  that  persons 
employed  by  school  districts  as  reading  specialists  under  the  Act  “shall  be  considered  as 
classroom  teachers  for  purposes  of  all  laws  dealing  with  permanent  status  of  certificated 
employees  employed  by  school  districts.”  Myers  reasons  that  if  Education  Code  section 
54122  requires  that  a  reading  specialist  employed  under  the  Miller-Unruh  Act  be  treated  the 
same  as  a  regular  classroom  teacher,  then  she  should  have  been  granted  probationary  status 
in  the  fall  of  1995  when  she  was  hired  as  a  Miller-Unruh  categorically  funded  reading 
specialist.  Under  such  an  analysis  Myers  would  have a  first  hire  date  of  August  31,  1995. 
There  are  several  persons  with  more  recent  hire  dates  holding  positions  that  Myers  could 
bump  into. 

15. 

Itis  unclear  from  the  language  of  section  54122  what  the  Legislature  meant 
when  it  provided  that  reading  specialists  under  the  Miller-Unruh  Act  are  to  be  “considered 
as  classroom  teachers.”  No  definition  or  explanation  of  this  requirement  is  provided  in  the 
statute.  Myers  suggests  that  section  54122  requires  that  any  service  as  a  reading  specialist 
under  the  Miller-Unruh  Act  must  be  credited  toward  permanent  status.  District  disagrees 
with  Myers’  interpretation.  It  notes  that  since  adoption  of  section  54122  in  1981  thousands 
of  teachers  have  been  employed  as  categorically  funded  Miller-Unruh  reading  specialists  and 
there  has  never  been  any  suggestion  that  this  was  legally  improper.

Although  Education  Code  section  54122  requires  that  persons  hired  as  reading 
specialists  under  the  Miller-Unruh  Act  be  “considered  as  classroom  teachers”  for  purposes  of 
all  laws  dealing  with  permanent  status,  it  does  not  necessarily  follow  that  this  means  a  person 
hired  as  a  temporary  employee  into  Miller-Unruh  categorically  funded  reading  specialist 
position  is  entitled  to  have  such  service  count  toward  permanent  status.  An  equally  plausible 
interpretation  of  section  54122  would  be  that  a  person  hired  as  a  temporary  employee  into  a 
Miller-Unruh  categorically  funded  reading  specialist  position  is  entitled  to  progress  in  the 
same  manner  as  a  classroom  teacher  hired  as  a  temporary  employee  into  a  categorically 
funded  position.  Under  such  an  interpretation  Myers  would  be  bound  by  the  terms  of  her 
contract  and  would  not  be  entitled  to  have  her  temporary  service  count  toward  permanent 
status.  (See  Rutley  v.  Belmont  Elementary  School  Dist.  (1973)  31  Cal.App.3d  702 
[individual  hired  as  a  substitute  teacher  to  replace  a  permanent  teacher  who  had  resigned  was 
not  entitled  to  classification  as  a  probationary  employee  where  the  contract  under  which  the 
individual  was  hired  specifically  classified  her  as  a  substitute;  terms  of  the  contract  were 
controlling].  Moreover,  to  interpret  section  54122  in  the  manner  suggested  by  respondent 
Myers  would  give  persons  hired  as  temporary  employees  into  Miller-Unruh  categorically 
funded  reading  specialist  positions  greater  rights  than  classroom  teachers  hired  as  temporary 
employees  into  categorically  funded  positions.  Pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44909 
the  service  of  individuals  hired  into  non-mandated  categorically  funded  positions  is  not 
included  in  the  service  required  to  attain  or  be  eligible  for  permanent  status  unless  specific 
conditions  are  met. 

° 

Application  of  the  rules  of  statutory  construction  also  suggests  that  it  was  not  the 
intent  of  the  Legislature  to  require  that  school  districts  credit  service  of  individuals  hired 
as  temporary  employees  into  categorically  funded  Miller-Unruh  Act  reading  specialist 
positions  toward  permanent  status.  In  determining  the  meaning  of  a  section,  the  intent  of 
the  Legislature  must  be  ascertained  so  as  to  effectuate  the  purpose  of  the  law.  In  determining 
intent  a  court  looks  first  to  the  words  of  the  statute,  which  must  be  construed  in  context, 
keeping  in  mind  the  statutory  purpose.  It  must  then  harmonize,  to  the  extent  possible,  related 
statutes  and  statutory  sections.  (Walnut  Creek  Manor  v.  Fair  Employment  &  Housing  Com. 
(1991)  54  Cal.3d  245,  268;  cf.  Delaney  v.  Superior  Court  (1990)  50  Cal.3d  785,  798.  When 
interpreting  a  legislative  enactment  courts  must  also  assume  there  is  an  awareness  by  the 
Legislature  of  existing  related  laws  and  an  intent  to  maintain  a  consistent  body  of  law. 
(Sacramento  Newspaper  Guild  v.  Sacramento  County  Bd.  of Supervisors  (1968)  263 
Cal.  App.2d  41,  54.) 

Education  Code  section  54101  states  that  the  Miller-Unruh  Act  was  enacted  “to 

provide  salary  payments  for  reading  specialists.”  This  statement  of  Legislative  intent 
undermines  Myers’  argument  that  the  intent  of  Education  Code  section  54122  was  to  require 
that  all  service  as  a  Miller-Unruh  Act  reading  specialist  be  counted  toward  attainment  of 
permanent  status. 

It  is  also  worth  noting  that  if  the  interpretation  of  section  54122  urged  by  Myers 

(i.e.,  that  any  service  as  a  reading  specialist  under  the  Miller-Unruh  Act  must  be  credited 

 

toward  permanent  status)  is  adopted  a  conflict  with  Education  Code  section  44909  would 
exist.  Section  44909  provides  that  the  service  of  individuals  hired  into  non-mandated 
categorically  funded  positions  shall  not  be  included  in  the  service  required  as  a  prerequisite 
to  attainment  of,  or  eligibility  to,  permanent  status  unless  certain  conditions  are  met. 
However,  if  section  54122  is  read  to  mean  that  individuals  hired  as  temporary  employees 
into  categorically  funded  Miller-Unruh  Act  reading  specialist  positions  are  entitled  to 
progress  in  the  same  manner  as  classroom  teachers  hired  into  categorically  funded  positions 
no  conflict  exists.  The  provisions  of  section  44909  would  be  equally  applicable  to  both 
groups.  The  two  statutes  would  be  harmonized  and  the  law  consistently  applied. 

Education  Code  section  44909  provides  that  the  hiring  of  employees  into  non- 

mandated  categorically  funded  positions  is  to  be  done  under  terms  and  conditions  that  are 
mutually  agreed  upon  by  the  employee  and  the  governing  board.  Under  the  terms  of  the 
agreement(s)  between  Myers  and  District  she  was  hired  as  a  temporary  employee  (not  a 
probationary  employee)  in  1995  and  each  succeeding  year  except  the  current  2003-2004 
school  year.  It  is  therefore  found  respondent  was  a  temporary  employee  in  1995  and  is  not 
entitled  to  classification  as  a  probationary  employee  in  1995  or  any  year  prior  to  the  2003- 
2004  school  year. 

16. 

|  The  evidence  established  that  the  District  will  be  reducing  services  for  the 

ensuing  school  year. 

17. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  to  any  respondent  is  being  retained  to  perform 

services  which  any  respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

18. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  services  is  related  to  the  welfare  of  the 

District  and  its  pupils. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Each  of  the  services  set  forth  in  Finding  3  is  a  kind  which  may  be  reduced  or 
discontinued  in  accordance  with  applicable  statutes  and  case  law.  (See  Ed.  Code  §  44955; 
Campbell  v.  Abbot  (1978)  76  Cal.App.3d  796,  Degener  v.  Governing  Bd.  (1977)  67 
Cal.App.3d  689.)  The  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor 
capricious  but  rather  a  proper  exercise  of  the  District’s  discretion. 

2. 

Cause  exists  because  of  the  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of 

services  pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44955  to  give  notice  to  respondents  that  their 
services  will  not  be  required  for  the  ensuing  school  year.  The  cause  relates  solely  to  the 
welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section 
44949.

  

ORDER 

Notice  may  be  given  to  respondents  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the 
2004-2005  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of 
services.
