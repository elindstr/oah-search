1. 

Carl  Wong,  Superintendent  for  Sonoma  County  (County  Superintendent) 

made  the  accusation  in  his  official  capacity. 

2. 

At  all  times  mentioned  herein,  each  respondent  has  been  employed  by  the

3. 

At  the  beginning  of  the  hearing  the  accusation  was  dismissed  as  to  Carolyn 

Hoy  and  Megan  Lesser. 

4. 

On  March  13,  2007,  the  Assistant  Superintendent-Human  Resources, 

Certificated  Personnel,  gave  the  County  Superintendent  written  notice,  pursuant  to  Education 
Code  sections  44949  and  44955,  of  his  recommendation  that  notice  be  given  respondents  that 
his  or  her  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  next  school  year  (2007-2008).  That  letter 

“stated  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation.

for  not  reemploying  him  or  her  for  the  next  school  year. 

e 

6. 

Cause  exists  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949  and  44955 
for  not  reemploying  respondents  for  the  next  school  year  because,  by  Revised  Resolution  of 
the  County  Superintendent  adopted  on  March  13,  2007,  the  County  Superintendent 
determined  it  was  necessary  to  reduce  or  eliminate  certain  particular  kinds  of  services  and 
that  as  a  result  of  those  reductions  or  eliminations  it  was  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of 
certificated  employees  of  the  County  Office  of  Education  to  the  extent  set  forth  in  the 
Revised  Resolution  as  of  the  close  of  the  current  school  year. 

The  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services  is  due  to  program  transfers  from  the 

County  Office  of  Education  to  the  individual  school  districts. 

The  two  services  specifically  relevant  to  this  hearing  are: 

0.2  F.T.E. 
10.0  F.T.E. 

Adaptive  Physical  Education 
Special  Education  Preschool 

7. 

Cause  for  not  reemploying  respondents  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the 

Sonoma  County  Office  of  Education  and  the  pupils  thereof  within  the  meaning  of  Education 
Code  sections  44949  and  44955. 

8. 

No  permanent  or  probationary  certificated  employee  of  the  County 

e 

Superintendent  having  less  seniority  than  respondents  will  be  retained  to  render  a  service 
which  respondents  are  certificated,  competent  and  legally  entitled  to  render. 

Maria  Hartnett-Laube  is  presently  a  .8  F.T.E.  employee  assigned  to  teach  Adaptive 

Physical  Education.  Her  position  will  be  reduced  to  .6  F.T.E.  for  the  2007-2008  school  year. 

Jeffrey  Gray,  Catherine  Lee,  Meri  Luscombe,  and  Valerie  Spizarsky  are  assigned  to 
teach  Special  Education  Preschool.  Each  will  not  be  reemployed  for  the  2007-2008  school 
year.
