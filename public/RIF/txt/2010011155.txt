FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1. 

Gay Todd, Ed.D., Superintendent of the Marysville Joint Unified School 
District (District), State of California, filed the Accusations in her official capacity as a 
public officer. 
 

2. 

On March 2, 2010, the Board of Trustees of the Marysville Joint Unified 

School District (Board) adopted Resolution No. 2009-10/29 and Resolution No. 2009-10/31, 
which reduced and/or discontinued particular kinds of certificated services no later than the 
beginning of the 2010-2011 school year. 
 
 

 

 

1

3. 

The Board further determined that it shall be necessary by reason of the 

reduction and/or discontinuance of services to decrease the number of permanent and/or 
probationary certificated employees at the close of the 2009-2010 school year by a 
corresponding number of full-time equivalent positions, and directed the Superintendent or 
her designee to proceed accordingly by notifying the appropriate employees to implement the 
Board’s determination. 
 

4. 

On or before March 15, 2010, the District served 123 certificated employees, 

including respondents, with a written notice that it had been recommended that notice be 
given to them pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 that their services 
would not be required for the next school year (Notice).  Each Notice set forth the reasons for 
the recommendation.  The Notice attached and incorporated by reference Attachment A to 
Resolution No. 2009-10/29 and Resolution No. 2009-10/31, which listed the services to be 
reduced or discontinued, resulting in a proposed reduction in the certificated staff by 67.15 
full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. 
 

5. 

At the same time that employees were served with the Notice, they were 
served with an Accusation, required accompanying documents, and a blank Request for 
Hearing/Notice of Defense form.  
 

6. 

Requests for Hearing/Notices of Defense were timely filed by 90 certificated 

employees. 
 

7. 

The following individuals filed Notices of Defense, but were not represented 

by Ms. Langenkamp:  Spencer Ansjorge; Jennifer Clayton; Sherri Dwyer; Wendy Fritzinger; 
Debra Jones; James Kupser; Cullen Meyer; Nichole Nakamura; Stephanie Peterson; Kellie 
Pickell; Vanessa Purdy; Christine Spade; Peri Sutherland; Alicia Wright; and Michael Zysk. 
 

8. 

Except as set forth in the stipulations below, any unrepresented employee (i.e., 

not listed on Exhibit A) that failed to file a Request for Hearing/Notice of Defense, or who 
failed to appear at hearing, including the individuals listed in Finding 7, has waived his or her 
right to a hearing, and may be laid off by the District.  No unrepresented employee appeared 
at the hearing. 
 

9. 

Each respondent (set forth in Exhibit A) is presently a certificated 

probationary or permanent employee of the District. 
 

10. 

Resolution No. 2009-10/29 and Resolution No. 2009-10/31 called for the 

reduction or discontinuance of the following particular kinds of services for the 2010-2011 
school year:

67.15 

The above-described services are “particular kinds of services” that can be reduced or 

discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955. 
 

11. 

In arriving at the number of certificated employees required to be terminated, 

Resolution No. 2009-10/29 and Resolution No. 2009-10/31 both state that the Board 
“considered anticipated certificated employee attrition (resignation, retirements, non-
reelections, temporary teacher releases, etc.)” as of March 2, 2010.  The Board concluded 

 

 

3

that, notwithstanding any vacancies resulting in positively assured attrition, it would still be 
necessary to terminate certificated employees equal to 67.15 FTE. 
 

12. 

The District maintains a seniority list which contains pertinent information 

such as employees’ date of first paid service, current assignment, and credentials on file.  The 
District used the seniority list to develop a proposed layoff list.  The District considered 
whether senior employees currently assigned in the various services being reduced or 
eliminated could displace, or “bump,” more junior employees.  In determining who would be 
laid off for each kind of service reduced or eliminated, the District first applied known 
vacancies and then applied in progressive sequence the seniority list in inverse order, from 
least to most senior.  Employees with the same date of hire were laid off according to the 
needs of the District and its students. 
 

13.  On March 2, 2010, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2009-10/30, which set 

forth criteria “to be applied, in the order listed, to determine the relative seniority of those 
certificated employees who first rendered paid probationary service on the same day.” 
(tiebreaking criteria).   
 
Stipulations Re: Seniority 
 

14.  Haley Phelan has seniority date is October 1, 2006.  She is a permanent 

employee of the District.

The following employees are second year probationary:   Alyce Elliott; 

18.  Genae DuChateua-Belding and Nikki Greminger have clear Multiple Subject 

(MS) credentials and seniority dates of August 17, 2007. 
 

19.  Deanna Hayes has a seniority date of August 17, 2007.  She was given credit 

for her Administrative Eligibility Certificate in the application of the District’s tiebreaker 
criteria.  Therefore, she was accorded greater seniority than other certificated employees with 
the same hire date (August 17, 2007) whose positions on the seniority list were identified by 
means of a lottery pursuant to the tiebreaking criteria, as follows:  Mailee Lor (1); Amber 
Baker (2); Nicole Robertson (3); Arie Choy Phongmany (4); Andrea Presser (5); Genae 
DuChateau-Belding (6); Jennifer McAdam (7); Karen McNay (8); Kellie Pickell (9); Peri

Stipulation Re: Rescission of Dismissal Notices 
 

20. 

The parties stipulated that notices to the following certificated employees were 

rescinded by the District:  Tracy Blake; Wendy Olson; James Rogers;1 Amanda Brown; 
Amanda Escheman; Jennifer Campbell; Lori Whitmore; Stephanie Peterson; Ryan Heasty; 
Michael Zyst; Jonathan Kinsman; Durea Jones; Phillip Waters; Dallas McBride; Michael 
Grace; Daniel DeVlaming; Peter Pantoja; Michelle Berry; Patricia Price; Michael O’Brien; 
Alicia Wright; Krishna Domingo; Walter Gallentine; Nichole Nakamura; Patricia Norby; 
Christopher Babb; John (Pete) Jeffrey; Vickie Sampson; Roxanne Burrow; Debra Jones; 
Cullen Meyer; Spence Ansorge; Joseph Flood; Eugene Duggan; James Kupser; and Billy 
Priddy. 
 

21. 

The parties stipulated that, if the District prevails on all issues, then Grace 

Callaway is the most senior teacher with an MS credential to be laid off, and the notices to 
Jami Owen, Inge Schlussler, and Melinda Goodson shall be rescinded by the District. 
 
Stipulation Re: Status of Temporary Employees 
 

22. 

The parties stipulated that Sarah Moffitt is a first year probationary employee 
with a seniority date of October 13, 2009, and that Celeste Guess is a first year probationary 
employee with a seniority date of August 14, 2009.  Respondents withdrew all other 
challenges to the status of temporary employees. 
 

23. 

The parties stipulated that the notice to Sarah Moffitt was rescinded by the 

District.  As result of the reclassification of Celeste Guess as a probationary employee who is 
now subject to layoff as a certificated employee with an MS credential, the parties stipulated 
that the notice to Angela Holt is rescinded by the District. 
 
Denise Huber 
 

24. 

In 2005, respondent Huber was a student in the California State University 
Chico (Chico State) teacher credentialing program.  In October 2005, she was placed in a 
classroom in the District as a student teacher.  On November 3, 2005, the principal at 
Johnson Park Elementary School, Louise McKray, asked respondent Huber to take over an 
“overflow” class, with students in grades 2, 3, and 4. 
 

25. 

The State of California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) issued 

an Internship MS Credential to respondent Huber, valid from January 30, 2006 through 
February 1, 2008, which by its terms was “restricted to service in MARYSVILLE JOINT 
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, YUBA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION.”  On 
February 27, 2006, Ramiro Carreón, Assistant Superintendent/Personnel Services, sent a 
form addressed to Dr. Deborah Summers, Chair of the Department of Education at Chico 
                                                

1 Any issue pertaining to Mr. Rogers’ seniority date was rendered moot by the fact that his notice was 

rescinded, and he was no longer a respondent in this proceeding.

Education will collaborate in the support and performance 
assessment of the intern. 

[¶] . . . [¶] 

26. 

Respondent Huber did not sign a contract with the District to work as a 
District intern.  The District considered her to be a substitute teacher.  The “Earnings 
History” payroll records for respondent Huber for the period from July 1, 2005 through June 
30, 2006, did not show any payment to respondent Huber until the February 2006 pay period.  
The Earnings History showed gross earnings of $300 paid on February 10, 2006; $2,000 paid 
on March 10, 2006; $2,300 paid on April 10, 2006; $1,500 paid on May 10, 2006; and 
$9,077.24 paid on June 9, 2006. 
 

27.  According to Mr. Carreón, the Earnings History reflects the fact that 

respondent Huber was paid as a day-to-day substitute at the daily rate of $100 per day; at the 
end of the school year, when it was determined that respondent Huber qualified for the long-
term substitute pay rate (the daily rate for a first year teacher), she was paid in a lump sum in 
June 2006.  He stated that the retroactive payment could not be for service as a District 
intern, because there would have been a contract in place, and respondent Huber would have 
been paid in accordance with the contract.  Mr. Carreón also stated that the form sent to 
Chico State reflected the District’s willingness to hire respondent Huber as an intern, but was 
not a contract to do so. The District does not have a practice of issuing contracts to day-to-
day or long-term substitute teachers. 
 

28. 

Respondent Huber was hired as a classroom teacher for the 2006-2007 school 

year.  Her seniority date, as reflected on the District’s seniority list, is August 18, 2006. 
 

29. 

In February 2009, respondent Huber questioned her seniority date, and 

contacted the District’s Human Resources Department.  On February 26, 2009, Mr. Carreón 
sent respondent Huber an email which stated: 

6

 

 

 

 

We have you as having worked from November 3, 2005 to the 
present.  We will calculate the total percentage of actual days 
worked per the law.  If the total is at least 75%, we will change 
your seniority date to Nov. 3, 2005. 

I will follow up, after we run the calculation. 

30. 

The District did not change respondent Huber’s seniority date, because she had 

not worked for 75 percent of the school days for the 2005-2006 school year.2 
 

31. 

Respondent Huber acknowledged that she did not work for a sufficient number 

of days to permit her service to be counted toward probationary status, if she is considered a 
substitute teacher.  Rather, she contended that she should have been accorded probationary 
status as a district intern.  In the alternative, she contended that she should be classified as 
probationary because she was never notified by the District that she was a substitute or 
temporary employee, under the rationale of Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma County Union High 
School District (2003) 29 Cal.4th 911. 
 

32. 

Education Code section 44917 states: 

Except as provided in Section … 44920, governing boards of 
school districts shall classify as substitute employees those 
persons employed in positions requiring certification 
qualifications, to fill positions of regularly employed persons 
absent from service. 

After September 1 of any school year, the governing board of 
any school district may employ, for the remainder of the school 
year, in substitute status any otherwise qualified person who 
consents to be employed in a position for which no regular 
employee is available, including persons retired for service 
under the State Teachers' Retirement System. Inability to 
acquire the services of a qualified regular employee shall be 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission on Teacher 
Credentialing. 

                                                

2 Education Code section 44918, subdivision (a), states:  “Any employee classified as a substitute or 

temporary employee, who serves during one school year for at least 75 percent of the number of days the regular 
schools of the district were maintained in that school year and has performed the duties normally required of a 
certificated employee of the school district, shall be deemed to have served a complete school year as a probationary 
employee if employed as a probationary employee for the following school year.” 

 

7

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

Any person employed for one complete school year as a 
temporary employee shall, if reemployed for the following 
school year in a position requiring certification qualifications, be 
classified by the governing board as a probationary employee 
and the previous year’s employment as a temporary employee 
shall be deemed one year’s employment as a probationary 
employee for purposes of acquiring permanent status. 

 

 

33. 

In this case, respondent was employed as a substitute teacher after September 
1, 2005, in a position for which no regular employee was available.  She was not hired as a 
temporary employee, nor was she hired as a District intern.  She did not work for at least 75 
percent of the number of days the regular schools of the district were maintained in the 2005-
2006 school year.  Therefore, she was not entitled to probationary status as of November 3, 
2005.  Her correct seniority date is August 18, 2006. 
 

34. 

Respondent Huber also contended that, if her seniority date could not be 

changed, she should be given greater seniority than other individuals with the same first date 
of paid service with the District, in consideration of the fact that she had previous teaching 
experience in the District.  Respondent Huber’s argument is not persuasive.  The District 
must apply its tiebreaker criteria to all teachers with the same first date of paid service, in 
accordance with Resolution 2009-10/30.  
 
Deanna Hayes 
 

35. 

Respondent Hayes is currently employed by the District as a teacher on special 

assignment.  She is the project director for the Making Mathematics Matter (M3) project, 
funded by the California Department of Education’s California Mathematics and Science 
Partnership Professional Development Program (CMSPPDP).  Respondent Hayes co-
authored the grant application, and she has served as the director for two and a half years.  
Respondent Hayes contended that she “play[s] a critical role in the continued life of the 
grant,” and therefore she should be retained by the District in her current position. 
 

36. 

Respondent Hayes has a seniority date of August 17, 2007.  She holds a clear 

MS credential and an Administrative Eligibility Certificate.  She received a layoff notice 
because she is being displaced by a more senior teacher who holds an MS credential whose 
position has been eliminated as a result of Resolution No. 2009-10/29.   
 

37. 

The Request for Applications (RFA) for the CMSPPDP sets forth the duties 

and responsibilities of the project director, and includes the recommendation that the project 
director “be involved in the writing of the grant application.”  The RFA states that “[t]he 
Grantee [District] may change the Project Director or other key personnel, but the Grantee 
shall immediately notify the CDE Program Monitor in writing via e-mail or fax of any such 
change.”  The RFA does not specify that the program director shall hold any specific 
credential or have any special qualifications. 
 

8

38. 

The District recognizes that respondent Hayes has done an excellent job in her 

position as project director of the M3 project.  However, it has determined that certificated 
employees with greater seniority than respondent Hayes who would otherwise be slated for 
layoff are competent and qualified to perform the duties of project director.  This 
determination is an appropriate exercise of the District’s discretion, and respondent Hayes’ 
challenge to her layoff is overruled. 
 
Independent Study 
 

39. 

The District has proposed a reduction of 5.0 FTE positions in the independent 

study program.  As a result, more senior certificated employees whose positions are being 
eliminated are displacing less senior respondents who hold MS credentials.  The District has 
not determined whether independent study services will be provided at all in the 2010-2011 
school year, or how those services would be provided if it is determined that those services 
are needed. 
 

40. 

Respondents contend that independent study services are not being reduced or 
eliminated, but instead will be provided next year; therefore, it is unlawful for the District to 
“bump” less senior certificated employees.  This argument is not persuasive.  Independent 
study services are not mandated services or programs, and the District is not required to 
provide them as part of the regular school day.  As of the date of hearing, the Board has 
proposed the elimination of these services.  Respondents’ contention that the District will be 
providing these services in the ensuing school year is speculation.  In any event, the District 
has discretion to determine how and in what manner services are to be provided. (Campbell 
Elementary Teachers Assn v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal. App.3d 796, 811; Gallup v. Board of 
Trustees (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1571, 1582-1590.)  Changing the way in which a service is 
to be performed constitutes a reduction in a particular kind of service, as does having fewer 
employees available to perform the service. (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal. 
App.3d 167, 179; Campbell Elementary Teachers Assn.. v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 
796, 811.) 
 

41. 

The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the particular kinds of services 
identified in Resolution No. 2009-10/29 and Resolution No. 2009-10/31 was not arbitrary or 
capricious, but constituted a proper exercise of discretion. 
 

42. 

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related to the 
welfare of the District and its pupils.  The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of 
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the District as 
determined by the Board. 
 

43.  No certificated employee junior to any respondent was retained to perform any 

services which any respondent was certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 

44955.  All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied. 
 

2. 

The services identified in Resolution No. 2009-10/29 and Resolution No. 
2009-10/31 are particular kinds of services that could be reduced or discontinued under 
section Education Code section 44955.  Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated 
employees of the District due to the reduction or discontinuance of particular kinds of 
services.  Cause for the reduction or discontinuance of services relates solely to the welfare 
of the District’s schools and pupils within the meaning of Education Code section 44949. 
 

3. 

A District may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955, 

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not, 
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that 
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to 
deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees, supra, 64 Cal.App.3d at p. 
178-179.) 
 

4. 

As set forth in Findings 24 through 34, the District properly classified 

respondent Denise Huber as a substitute teacher during the 2005-2006 school year, and 
properly identified her seniority date as August 18, 2006. 
 

5. 

As set forth in Findings 35 through 38, the District properly identified 

respondent Deanna Hayes as a certificated employee to be laid off pursuant to Resolution 
No. 2009-10/29 and Resolution No. 2009-10/31. 
 

6. 

As set forth in Findings 39 and 40, the District did not abuse its discretion with 

regard to the proposed reduction of 5.0 FTE independent study services for the 2010-2011 
school year. 
 

7. 

The District has prevailed on all issues.  Therefore, as set forth in Findings 20, 

21, and 23, the District has rescinded or shall rescind notices of layoff to the following 
individuals:  Tracy Blake; Wendy Olson; James Rogers; Amanda Brown; Amanda 
Escheman; Jennifer Campbell; Lori Whitmore; Stephanie Peterson; Ryan Heasty; Michael 
Zyst; Jonathan Kinsman; Durea Jones; Phillip Waters; Dallas McBride; Michael Grace; 
Daniel DeVlaming; Peter Pantoja; Michelle Berry; Patricia Price; Michael O’Brien; Alicia 
Wright; Krishna Domingo; Walter Gallentine; Nichole Nakamura; Patricia Norby; 
Christopher Babb; John (Pete) Jeffrey; Vickie Sampson; Roxanne Burrow; Debra Jones; 
Cullen Meyer; Spence Ansorge; Joseph Flood; Eugene Duggan; James Kupser; Billy Priddy; 
Jami Owen; Inge Schlussler; Melinda Goodson; Sarah Moffitt; and Angela Holt. 
 

8. 

No employee with less seniority than any named respondent is being retained 

to render a service which any named respondent is certificated and competent to render.  
Except as set forth in Legal Conclusion 7, the Board may give respondents final notice 

 

 

10

before May 15, 2010, that their services will not be required for the ensuing school year, 
2010-2011. 
 
 

ORDER 

Except as set forth in Legal Conclusion 7, the Accusations served on respondents are 

 
 
sustained.  Notices of layoff shall be rescinded as to the certificated employees listed in 
Legal Conclusion 7.  Notices shall be given to the remaining respondents identified in 
attached Exhibit A that their services will not be required for the 2010-2011 school year 
because of the reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services.  Notice shall be 
given to respondents in inverse order of seniority.
