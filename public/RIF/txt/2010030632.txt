4. 

On or before March 15, 2010, each respondent was given written notice that 

 
the Superintendent had recommended that notice be given to respondents, pursuant to 
Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, that their services will not be required for the 
ensuing year.  Each written notice set forth the reasons for the recommendation.  The notices 
satisfied the requirements of sections 44949 and 44955.  San Jose Teachers Association, Inc. 
v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 632; Campbell Elementary Teachers Association v. 
Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 803-04, distinguishing Karbach v. Board of Education 
(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 355, 360-63. 
 
 
cause for not reemploying them for the ensuing school year.  Accusations were timely served 
on respondents, and each respondent filed a timely Notice of Defense.  All pre-hearing 
jurisdictional requirements have been met. 
 

Each respondent timely requested in writing a hearing to determine if there is

The resolution also provided: 

“That “competency” as described in Education Code sections 44955(b), 

44956, and 44957, for the purposes of bumping and rehire rights, shall necessarily 
include possession of a valid EL authorization and being No Child Left Behind 
Compliant in the subject area.” 

The services set forth above are particular kinds of services which may be reduced or 

 
discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.  California Teachers 
Association v. Board of Trustees of the Goleta Union School District (1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 
32, 34-37 and cases cited therein.  See also San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen, supra at 
635-38, in which the court specifically rejected the reasoning of Burgess v. Board of 
Education (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 571; Zalac v. Governing Board (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838, 
853-54.

its students.   
 
 
The District created a Seniority List which contains employees’ seniority dates

Teresa Chandler teaches second grade at Myers Elementary School.  She has a 

senior employees currently assigned in the two services being reduced.  The District then 
determined whether the least senior employees held credentials in another area and were 
entitled to “bump” other employees.  In determining who would be laid off for each kind of 
service reduced, the District counted the number of reductions not covered by the known 
vacancies, and determined the impact on incumbent staff in inverse order of seniority.  The 
District then checked the credentials of affected individuals and whether they could “bump” 
other employees.  
 
 
multiple subject credential and a CLAD certificate.  Her seniority date is July 9, 2003.  Ms. 
Chandler testified at the hearing that she was hired in August 2002 as a “teacher-in-training” 
and began shortly after the “red track” began.  She was assigned to the classroom of Besse 
Borshe, a fifth grade teacher, where she was to learn to be a teacher for the following year.  
Ms. Chandler testified Ms. Borshe took a medical leave in September, did not return during 
the remainder of the school year, and retired.  Ms. Chandler testified she taught the class for 
the remainder of the school year, and was paid as a substitute. 
 
 
The District did not submit any records to establish when Ms. Chandler began 
teaching during the 2002-03 school year or her status for that year.  The District’s seniority 
list indicates she was hired as a probationary teacher on July 9, 2003, and she is now tenured. 
 
 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

2. 

1. 

Jurisdiction in this matter relating to the elimination of 162 full-time 

 
 
equivalent positions exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.  All notices and 
jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied. 
 
Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the District 
 
to discontinue particular kinds of services relating to 162 full-time equivalent positions.  The 
cause for the reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related solely to the 
welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof.  A preponderance of the evidence sustained the 
charges set forth in the Accusation.  It is recommended that the Board give respondents 
notice before May 15, 2010, that their services will no longer be required by the District.  
 
 
 

Education Code section 44918 provides in part: 

3. 

Any employee classified as a substitute or temporary employee, who serves 

(a) 
during one school year for at least 75 percent of the number of days the regular 
schools of the district were maintained in that school year and has performed the 
duties normally required of a certificated employee of the school district, shall be 
deemed to have served a complete school year as a probationary employee if 
employed as a probationary employee for the following school year. 
 
4. 

 
substitute or temporary teacher in August 2002, and she served more than 75 percent of the 

Based upon the testimony of Ms. Chandler, it appears she was hired as a 

 

4

number of days the regular schools of the district were maintained during the 2002-03 school 
year, and she performed the duties normally required of a certificated employee of the 
district.  Accordingly, she must be deemed to have completed the school year as a 
probationary employee, since she was employed as a probationary employee for the 
following school year. 
 
 
The District is therefore ordered to review its records to determine when she began serving in 
the capacity of a substitute or temporary teacher for the 2002-03 school year, and change her 
seniority date to reflect the date she began service with the District during that school year. 

Ms. Chandler did not know the day she began her service as a “teacher-in-training.”  

 
Changing Ms. Chandler’s seniority date to some time in early August 2002 does not, 

 
however, mean she will not be laid off.  The seniority list indicates that elementary school 
teachers senior to Ms. Chandler, with seniority dates as far back as August 6, 2001, will be 
laid off.  Thus, the accusation against Ms. Chandler must be sustained. 
 
 

 ORDER 

1. 

2. 

The accusation served on respondent Shontoyia Gilliard is dismissed. 

 
 
 
The Accusations served on the remaining 103 respondents set forth in Exhibit 
 
A, below, are sustained.  Notice shall be given to each respondent before May 15, 2010 that 
his or her services will not be required for the 2010-11 school year pursuant to the Board of 
Education’s resolution because of the reduction of particular kinds of services.  
 
 
 
 
 
DATED:  __________________________ 
 
 
 
 

Notice shall be given in inverse order of seniority.
