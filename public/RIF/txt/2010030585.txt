SUMMARY OF PROPOSED DECISION 

 
 
The Governing Board of the Sulphur Springs School District (Board) 
determined to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services provided by teachers 
and other certificated employees for budgetary reasons.  The decision was not related 
to the competency and dedication of the individuals whose services are proposed to 
be reduced or eliminated.   
 
///

District staff carried out the Board’s decision by using a selection process 

 
involving review of credentials and seniority, “bumping,” and breaking ties between 
employees with the same first dates of paid service.  The selection process was in 
accordance with the requirements of the Education Code.  
  
  

FACTUAL FINDINGS 

4.  The Director of Personnel and Pupil Services made and filed Accusations 

1.  Kim Lytle is the Director of Personnel and Pupil Services for the District. 

3.  Notice was served on all respondents by either personal service or certified 

 
 
 
2.  Between February 26, and March 12, 2010, the District served on each 
 
respondent a written notice that it had been recommended that notice be given to 
respondents pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 that their services 
would not be required for the next school year.  Each written notice set forth the 
reasons for the recommendation and noted that 65.2 full-time equivalent (FTE) 
positions would be reduced and/or discontinued.   
 
 
mail.  Certificated employees timely requested, in writing, a hearing to determine if 
there is cause for not reemploying them for the ensuing school year.   
 
 
against each of the certificated employees who requested a hearing.  The Accusations, 
with required accompanying documents and blank Notices of Defense, were timely 
served on those certificated employees.

6.  Respondents in this proceeding are probationary or permanent certificated

1 The District objected to Respondent Natalie Ripley participating in the 
 
hearing because it had not received Ms. Ripley’s Notice of Defense by the March 26, 
2010 deadline.  Ms. Ripley signed and dated her Notice of Defense on March 8, 2010, 
and submitted it to Patricia Fitzpatrick, the president of the Sulphur Springs Teachers 
Association, to be submitted to the District along with the other Notices of Defense.  
What happened to Ms. Ripley’s Notice of Defense thereafter is not known.  Ms. 
Fitzpatrick credibly testified that she placed Ms. Ripley’s Notice of Defense into an 
intra-district envelope and placed it into Kim Lytle’s mailbox.  Ms. Lytle and her 
secretary, Merry Martinez, testified with equal credibility that they never saw it.  
Upon learning that Ms. Lytle had not received Ms. Ripley’s Notice of Defense, Ms. 
Fitzpatrick sent it to Ms. Lytle via facsimile on March 31, 2010.  However, the 
District refused to accept Ms. Ripley’s Notice of Defense, claiming that it had not 
been submitted by the statutory deadline.  The Administrative Law Judge ruled that 
Ms. Ripley had done all she could to ensure timely submission of her Notice of 
Defense, that the District had not been prejudiced by its late submission, and that to 
preclude Ms. Ripley’s participation in the hearing based on the above facts would 
constitute a deprivation of due process.  Ms. Ripley was permitted to participate in the 
hearing.

NUMBER OF FULL-TIME
EQUIVALENT POSITIONS

7.  On February 24, 2010, in Resolution No. R 10-03, the Board took action to 

 
reduce or discontinue the following particular kinds of services for the 2010-2011 
school year: 
 
SERVICES 
 
 
1 Categorical Program Director 
 
5 Elementary Assistant Principals 
 
61 K-6 Classroom Teaching Positions 
 
3 Intervention Teachers 
 
3 Physical Education Teachers 
 
2 Music Teachers 
 
1 Program Coordinator-Special Education   
 
2 Art Teachers 
 
1 CBET Teacher 
 
Total   
 
 
vacancies in School Year 2010-2011 due to retirements, release of temporary 
teachers, and resignations.   
 
 
determining the relative seniority of certificated employees who first rendered paid 
service on the same date.  It provided that the order of termination shall be based on 
the needs of the District. 
 
 
10.  The District maintains a seniority list which contains employees’ seniority 
dates (first date of paid service as a probationary employee), current assignments and 
locations, advanced degrees, credentials, and authorizations.  Credential and 
authorization data are obtained from the records of the County Office of Education, at 
which certificated employees must register such documents.

12.  The District used information from its seniority list to apply the tie-

11.  The District used the seniority list to develop a proposed layoff and 
“bumping” list of the least senior employees currently assigned in the various services 
being reduced.  In determining who would be laid off for each kind of service 
reduced, the District counted the number of reductions not covered by the known 
vacancies, and determined the impact on incumbent staff in inverse order of seniority.  
The District then checked the credentials of affected individuals and whether they 
could “bump” other less senior employees.   
 
 
breaker criteria of Exhibit “B” to Board Resolution No. R 10-03.   
 
 
13.  Certain employees share the same first date of paid service as a 
probationary employee.  Application of the tie-breaker criteria of Exhibit “B” to 
Board Resolution R 10-03 did not resolve their tied first dates of paid service.   Their 
relative seniority was determined by a lottery in which their names were drawn.  The 
person whose name was selected first then chose a piece of paper from among a 
number of similar pieces.2  A number was written on each piece of paper.  The 
process was then repeated for the number of employees with the same first date of 
paid service as a probationary employee.  The individual who chose the paper bearing 
the highest number above “one” was deemed the individual with the greatest seniority 
for that seniority date.

44955, the Board chose to exempt from the order of certificated layoff, certificated 
employees who, “because of special training, experience, or credential that others 
with more seniority do not possess,” met any of the following criteria:   
 

1. 

2. 

Certificated personnel who possess a credential 

Certificated personnel who possess administrative 

3.  Certificated personnel who possess a credential authorizing 

 
credentials, who are currently assigned to administrative positions, and 
who will be assigned to administrative positions for the 2010-2011 
school year. 
 
 
authorizing service in special education, who are presently assigned 
within the scope of that credential, and who will be assigned within the 
scope of that credential for the 2010-2011 school year. 
 
 
service in language, speech and hearing, who are presently assigned 
within the scope of that credential, and who will be assigned within the 
scope of that credential for the 2010-2011 school year. 
 
 
service as a school nurse who is currently assigned under that permit 
area, and who, if serving in school year 2010-2011 will be placed in a 
school nurse assignment. 
 
 
a BCC or BCLAD, authorizing service in working with English 
Learners, who are currently assigned within the scope of that 
credential, and who will be assigned within the scope of that credential 
for the 2010-2011 school year. 

Certificated personnel who possess a permit authorizing 

Certificated personnel who possess a credential, such as

15.  The rationale for the exemptions was that employees satisfying those 

 
 
criteria are generally difficult to locate and hire.   
 
 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1.  All notice and jurisdictional requirements set forth in sections 44949 and 

 
 
44955 were met.

2.  All of the identified services are particular kinds of services that could be 
 
reduced or discontinued under Code section 44955.  The Board’s decision to reduce 
or discontinue the identified services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and was a 
proper exercise of its discretion. Cause for the reduction or discontinuation of services 
relates solely to the welfare of the District’s schools and pupils within the meaning of 
Code section 44949. 
 
3.  Respondents argued that the Board ordered the Superintendent or his/her 
 
designee to serve only a sufficient number of preliminary notices to cover the FTE 
positions being reduced or eliminated, and that the fact that more employees received 
notices constituted over-noticing and justified a dismissal of the Accusation. 
 
 
4.  It was not established that the District acted in an arbitrary or capricious 
manner in pursuing and implementing the layoff by issuing more preliminary notices of 
layoff than the number of FTE positions being reduced or eliminated.  No statutory, 
regulatory, or case authority was offered for the proposition that the number of 
certificated employees who receive preliminary notices must equal the number of FTE 
positions being reduced or eliminated.  Further, even if one were to accept Resolution   
R 10-03 as an order to the Superintendent, the resolution refers to a list of employees 
who “shall” receive notices of termination.  However, the resolution does not require 
notices only to enough employees to cover the number of FTE positions being reduced 
or eliminated.  It provides the Superintendent or his/her designee with discretion to 
notice additional employees.  The resolution reads in part: 
 

The Superintendent or his designee is hereby directed to serve notices of 
termination in accordance with and in the manner prescribed by 
Education Code §§ 44955 and 44949.  In addition, the 
Superintendent/designee is authorized, where deemed necessary, to issue 
additional notices so that certain other employees whose rights may be 
affected will have an opportunity to be heard. 

  
5.  A District may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955, 
 
subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall 
not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by 
determining that proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer 
employees are made available to deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford v. Board 
of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 178-179.)   
 
6.  Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees of the District 
 
due to the reduction and discontinuation of particular kinds of services.  The District 
identified the certificated employees providing the particular kinds of services that the 
Board directed be reduced or discontinued.   
 
 
services which a more senior employee is certificated and competent to render. 

7.    No  junior  certificated  employee  is  scheduled  to  be  retained  to  perform 

 

7

8.  A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a 
 
continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to fill.  In doing so, 
the senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that 
position.  (Lacy v. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469.)  Junior 
teachers may be given retention priority over senior teachers if the junior teachers 
possess superior skills or capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack.  
(Santa Clara Federation of Teachers, Local 2393, v. Governing Board of Santa Clara 
Unified School District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831, 842-843.)  That was properly 
done in this case by way of the exemption list. 
 
 

ORDER 

2.  Notice shall be given in inverse order of seniority. 

 
 
1.  The Accusations against the respondents are sustained.  Notice may be 
given to the respondents that their services will not be required for the 2010-2011 
school year because of reduction or discontinuance of particular kinds of services.
