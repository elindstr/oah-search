FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Deborah Bettencourt is the Superintendent of the Folsom Cordova Unified

School District (District). She performed her duties solely in her official capacity.

2.

Before February 17, 2011, the Superintendent determined that funding for the
2011-2012 school year would be reduced, thereby necessitating the reduction or elimination
of certain particular kinds of services (PKS). The Superintendent recommended to the Board
that certain particular kinds of services be reduced or eliminated, affecting employees
occupying 78.89 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. The Superintendent’s resolution to
eliminate and reduce teaching services was made solely for the welfare of students.

3.

On February 17, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution No. 02-17-11-26,

providing for the reduction or elimination of PKS, amounting to 78.89 certificated positions.
The PKS Resolution is attached as Attachment B.

4.

Also on February 17, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution No. 02-17-11-27,

specifying criteria to be used in determining the order of termination of certificated
employees who first rendered paid service as probationary teachers on the same date (tie-
breaking criteria). The Tie-Breaker Resolution states in relevant part:

1)

The following criteria are authorized and directed to be applied, in the
order listed, to determine the relative seniority of those certificated
employees who first rendered paid probationary service on the same
day:

a.

b.

c.
d.

Possession of a credential which is needed by the school
program;
Breadth of credentials possessed (including BCLAD/CLAD,
National Board Certification and other certificates);
Bilingual certification or skill where need for language exists;
Lottery number assigned pursuant to the certificated layoff
conducted during the summer of 2010 under Education code
section 44955.5, if any;

5 Attachment D is the Stipulated Layoff Agreement of the Parties with signature page
of counsel. Counsel are in possession of the signature pages for the certificated employees.
These pages are also filed with OAH.

2

e.

All other factors deemed equal, by lot.

2)

The Board hereby approves the exercise of judgment of the District
Superintendent, or designee, in applying the criteria set forth above.

5.

On March 1, 2011, the Superintendent served on persons affected by the

reduction and elimination of PKS a “Notice of Recommendation That Services Will Not Be
Required” for the ensuing 2011–2012 school year (Layoff Notice or Notice). The Notice
stated that the Superintendent had recommended to the Board that notice be given to
respondents pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, that their services would
not be required for the ensuing school year. The Notice advised that the Board had passed a
Resolution reducing or discontinuing PKS in order to reduce certificated staff. The Notice
included copies of the PKS and Tie-Breaker Resolutions.

6.

On March 1, 2011, the Superintendent served on persons affected by the

reduction and elimination of PKS a “Precautionary Notice That Services Will Not Be
Required” for the ensuing 2011–2012 school year (Precautionary Notice). The Precautionary
Notice stated that the Superintendent had commenced a layoff for the ensuing school year
that could result in termination of permanent and probationary certificated employees
pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. The Precautionary Notice stated that
the District did not believe the recipient would be subject to the layoff. The Notice included
copies of the PKS and Tie-Breaker Resolutions.

Categories of employees who received a Precautionary Notice are: regular
certificated employees, temporary certificated employees, probationary certificated
employees, and previously employed certificated employees.

7.

On March 1, 2011, the Superintendent served on persons affected by the

reduction and elimination of PKS, notices of release/non-reelection. The Notices of Release
were served on certificated temporary employees and administrators. (Ed. Code, §§ 44951
and 44954, subd. (b).)

8.

Respondents timely requested a hearing to determine if there was cause for not

re-employing them for the ensuing school year. Several certificated employees did not
request a hearing pursuant to Education Code section 44949, subdivision (b). They therefore
waived their due process rights in this matter. (see Attachment C – Procedural Status
Chart/Alpha 2011 which identifies employees who waived their due process rights.)

9.

The Superintendent made and filed Accusations against each of the employees

who requested a hearing. The Accusations, required accompanying documents, and blank
Notices of Defense were timely served on those employees.

10.

Respondents timely filed Notices of Defense to the Accusations.

3

11.

Rescissions. On April 27, 2011, the District agreed to rescind the Layoff
Notice issued to Don Isbell. As to Mr. Isbell, the Accusation and Notice of Hearing are
withdrawn.

12.

Skipping. “Junior employees may be given retention priority over senior

employees only if they possess special skills or capabilities which their more senior
counterparts lack.” (Ed. Code, § 44955, subd. (d)(1); Poppers v. Tamalpais Union High
School Dist. (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 399, 405.) Pursuant to the Stipulation, the parties agreed
that the following programs within the District will be skipped:

a.

b.

c.

d.

FLES – Foreign Language Elementary School.

TUPE – Tobacco Use Prevention Program.

AAC – Augmentative Alternative Communication.

Mather Youth Academy.

Employees in these programs possess special skills, training, and experience to
provide services within these programs and as such, were not affected by the layoff.6 These
skipping criteria were agreed to by the parties and are found to be valid. Employees in these
programs were properly retained.

13.

The Stipulation adjusted the seniority list data (seniority date or status) of the

following employees:

Procedural Status Chart/Alpha 2011 which identifies all employees who were noticed.)

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

Applicable Laws

1.

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to sections 44949 and 44955,
by reason of Factual Finding 1 through 8. All notices and other jurisdictional requirements
of sections 44949 and 44955 were met. The notices sent to respondents indicated the
statutory basis for the reduction of services and, therefore, were sufficiently detailed to
provide them due process. (Ed. Code, §§ 44949, subd. (a) and 44955, subd. (c); Bakersfield
Elementary Teachers v. Bakersfield City School Dist. (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1272.)

2.

The anticipation of receiving less money from the state for the next school

year is an appropriate basis for a reduction in services under section 44955. As stated in San
Jose Teachers Assn v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 638-639, the reduction of particular

6

kinds of services on the basis of financial considerations is authorized under that section,
and, “in fact, when adverse financial circumstances dictate a reduction in certificated staff,
section 44955 is the only statutory authority available to school districts to effectuate that
reduction.” The District must be solvent to provide educational services and cost savings are
necessary to resolve its financial crisis. The Superintendent’s decision to reduce particular
kinds of services was a proper exercise of her discretion.

3.

The services identified in Board Resolution 02-17-11-26 are particular kinds

of services that could be reduced or discontinued under Education Code section 44955.
(Attachment B.) Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees of the District
due to the reduction and discontinuation of particular kinds of services. Cause for the
reduction or discontinuation of services relates solely to the welfare of the District’s schools and
pupils within the meaning of section 44949.

4.

A District may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not,
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.) The skipping and tie-breaking criteria established by the District were proper
pursuant to Education Code section 44955, subdivisions (b) and (d).

5.

The Notices sent to respondents indicated the statutory basis for the reduction of

services and, therefore, were sufficiently detailed to provide them due process. (San Jose
Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627; Santa Clara Federation of
Teachers v. Governing Board (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831.) The description of services to be
reduced, both in the Board’s Resolutions and in the Notices, adequately describes particular
kinds of services. (Zalac v. Ferndale USD (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838. See, also, Degener v.
Governing Board (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 689.)

6.

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 to provide final

Notice to respondents not identified in the Stipulation for rescission, that their services will
not be required in the 2011-2012 school year because of the reduction and elimination of
particular kinds of services.

RECOMMENDATION

1.

Notice shall be given to respondents not identified in the Stipulation for

rescission, that their services will not be required in the 2011-2012 school year because of
the reduction and elimination of particular kinds of services.

2.

Pursuant to the Stipulation, the District shall adjust the seniority list data
(seniority date or status), of the following certificated employees: (Factual Finding 13.)

4.

Pursuant to the Stipulation, the District shall rescind Layoff Notices issued to

the certificated employees listed in Factual Finding 14.

Pursuant to the Stipulation, the District Shall afford laid off employees all of

the rights and protections set forth in the Education Code including but not limited to
Education Code sections 44956 and 44957.

5.

Pursuant to the Stipulation, respondent Hugh Sims, by signing the agreement,

does not waive any administrative remedy regarding a claim for discrimination/retaliation.
In the event that Mr. Sims raises a discrimination/retaliation claim, the District agrees that it
will not raise a failure to exhaust administrative remedies defense as a result of Mr. Sims not
raising the matter in this layoff proceeding.

6.

All terms of the Stipulated agreement (Attachment D), shall become effective

and binding upon obtaining signatures of all parties.
