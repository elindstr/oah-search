FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Complainant Roger L. Buschmann issued the accusation in his official
capacity as chief administrative officer of the San Francisco Unified School District
(district).

2.

3.

Respondents are certificated employees of the district. The respondents are

identified on Appendices A and B, attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

On March 1, 2011, the district’s governing board adopted Resolution No. 113-

1S01a (as amended), in which it resolved to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of
services for the 2011-2012 school year, and directed the superintendent to give notice to
certificated employees that their services would be reduced or eliminated at the end of the
2010-2011 school year (the PKS resolution). The resolution states that “a total of 139 FTE
in administrative services and 140 FTE in instructional services, as set forth in Exhibit A,
shall be reduced or eliminated . . . .”1 (Original emphasis.) Exhibit A to the board’s
resolution is set forth in Appendix C to this proposed decision, attached hereto and
incorporated herein by this reference.

The reductions in instructional services are divided between the district’s elementary,
middle and high school programs, and the PKS resolution further identifies the reductions by
program or service. For example, the 53 FTE reduction in the elementary school program is
broken down into the non-classroom and classroom programs, and then more particularly by
area (e.g., nurses, teacher on special assignment), program (e.g., Visual and Performing Arts
Program) or service (e.g., physical education, 4th grade services). The reductions in the
middle and high school program are similarly described.

Bumping issues

4.

As a general principle, permanent and probationary certificated employees
must be laid off in inverse order of their seniority. (Ed. Code, § 44955, subd. (c).) Under
Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), no permanent employee may be terminated
“while any probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to
render a service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.” A
school district must “make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that employees
shall be retained to render any service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to
render.” (Ed. Code, § 44955, subd. (c).) The process by which a senior employee displaces
a junior employee is commonly referred to as “bumping.”

5.

The district created a detailed bumping chart for the proposed 2011-2012

layoffs. The chart is correlated to the reductions identified in the PKS resolution. Thus, for
each program and service identified in the PKS resolution, the bumping chart identifies the
person or position to be reduced; the person’s FTE, seniority date and credentials; the person

1 “FTE” means full-time equivalent.

2

who will be bumped, and that person’s FTE, seniority date and credentials. In some cases,
the person to be bumped has not been finally determined, because there may be more than
one bumping path that the district can follow.

6.

UESF notes that the bumping chart goes deeper than the reductions called for

in the PKS resolution; that is, it identifies the bumping rights of employees beyond those
who are likely to be affected by the layoff. For example, in Visual and Performing Arts, the
PKS resolution calls for a 6 FTE reduction, but the bumping chart identifies employees in 6.8
FTE; in K-5 classroom services, the PKS resolution states a 32 FTE reduction, while the
bumping chart identifies 32.6 FTE in reductions; in high school English, the PKS resolution
calls for a reduction of 4 FTE, but the bumping chart identifies 12.8 FTE. All told, UESF
identifies 14 areas in which the bumping chart goes deeper than the PKS resolution and, in
total, the bumping chart identifies 177.5 FTE in reductions in instructional services while the
PKS resolution calls for 140 FTE in reductions.

UESF argues that the district may not exceed the reductions called for in the PKS

resolution. UESF is correct, as the district acknowledges in its reply brief. The district states
that it has no intent pursue layoffs in excess of those authorized by the PKS resolution.
UESF argues that if a fractional FTE remains after accounting for layoff of the most junior
employees in any program or service, that fractional FTE should be retained by the most
senior employee subject to layoff. In its reply brief, the district states that it accepts UESF’s
argument.

Seniority/bumping issues

7.

UESF asserts that the district exceeded its authority “by exempting certain

teachers on special assignment from the list of services.” (Teachers on special assignment
are referred to by the parties as “TSA’s.”) Although its argument is not completely clear,
UESF appears to argue that while the district has identified some TSA’s for layoff, it did not
issue preliminary notices to three TSA’s who, by virtue of their seniority dates, should have
been noticed. Based upon a document that UESF attached to its brief and labeled “Exhibit
2,” UESF’s asserts that Matthew Attaway, Robert Rankin, and Gloria E. Sagastume all have
a seniority date of August 19, 2009, and should have been given preliminary layoff notices.

The document attached to UESF’s brief as Exhibit 2 is not a hearing exhibit and was
never offered or admitted into evidence. UESF states the contents of Exhibit 2 are based on
the seniority lists that were admitted into evidence, but that is not the case. The seniority
lists admitted into evidence establish that Attaway’s seniority date is November 13, 2008,
that Rankin’s seniority date is August 20, 2008, and that Sagastume’s seniority date is
August 22, 2007. There is no contrary evidence. UESF’s argument that Attaway, Rankin
and Sagastume were improperly retained is not supported by the evidence.

8.

UESF asserts that the evidence is inconsistent on the seniority cutoff date for

the layoffs in the area of K-5 classroom services. UESF notes that in the district’s Exhibit 26
(“Seniority Date Analysis by Credential Area for Respondents”), the seniority cutoff date for

3

teachers with a multiple subject credential is August 19, 2009. UESF argues that, in the area
of K-5 classroom services, “one would expect that the most senior person in that group
would have a seniority date of August 19, 2010 [sic], according to Exhibit 26. That is not the
case. The most senior person, Ashley Freeman, has a seniority date of August 9, 2010.”
This “discrepancy,” UESF argues, between August 9 and August 19, 2010, affects 26
individuals who have a first date of paid service between those dates.

UESF’s argument is based on a misreading of Exhibit 26. Exhibit 26 identifies the
seniority date of the most senior person with a multiple subject credential who is subject to
layoff. That date is August 19, 2009, not August 19, 2010, as UESF states in its brief. The
fact that Ashley Freeman, the most senior person subject to layoff from K-5 classroom
services, has a seniority date of August 9, 2010, is not inconsistent with Exhibit 26; K-5
classroom services is not the only area in which the services of teachers with multiple subject
credentials are being reduced.

Skipping issues

9.

Despite the general principle that employees must be laid off in the inverse
order of their seniority, Education Code section 44955, subdivision (d), allows a district to
deviate from seniority and “skip” junior employees under certain circumstances.

10.
resolution states:

Resolution No. 113-1S01a establishes the district’s skipping criteria. The

[P]ursuant to Education Code § 44955(d)(1), it will be necessary
to retain the services of certificated employees in the 2011-2012
school year regardless of seniority, who possess credentials,
special training, and experience, and qualifications needed for
and who are currently assigned in this 2010-2011 school year to
render service in the following programs:

 All certificated employees possessing and teaching under
a clear, preliminary, intern or emergency single subject
mathematics credential during the 2010-2011 school
year;

 All certificated employees possessing and teaching under
a clear, preliminary, intern or emergency single subject
science credential during the 2010-2011 school year;

 All certificated employees possessing and teaching under

a clear, preliminary, intern or emergency special
education credential during the 2010-2011 school year;

4

 All certificated employees serving in a bilingual

education classroom and possessing and teaching, during
the 2010-2011 school year under a clear, preliminary,
intern or emergency Bilingual Cross Cultural Language
and Academic Development (BCLAD) Certification.

11.

UESF asserts that respondent Hannah Lingrell should have been skipped under

the criterion for teaching in a bilingual classroom. The evidence established, however, that
although Lingrell has a BCLAD, she is not presently teaching in a bilingual classroom. She
is teaching English Language Development. Under the district’s skipping criteria, a teacher
is not eligible to be skipped unless she is presently teaching in a bilingual classroom, and
Lingrell is not. Lingrell is not eligible to be skipped.

12.

UESF asserts that, in administering the reductions in K-5 classroom services,

the district impermissibly skipped Instructional Reform Facilitators (IRF’s), a service not
identified in the district’s skipping criteria. In its brief, UESF notes that the most senior
teacher identified for layoff in the category of K-5 classroom services is respondent Ashley
Freeman with a seniority date of August 9, 2010, and then identifies 11 teachers assigned as
IRF’s and their seniority dates. UESF’s argument appears to be that these 11 teachers are
junior to Freeman and that they should be laid off in the reduction of K-5 classroom services.
UESF asserts that they were not laid off as part of those reductions because they were
invalidly skipped.

UESF’s argument is not persuasive on several grounds. Two of the teachers

identified by UESF, Altshuler and Young, are senior to Freeman (Altshuler, August 19,
2009, and Young, August 17, 2009). Six of the remaining nine teachers identified by UESF
are not assigned to elementary schools, but instead teach in a middle school, high school or
college prep academy (Duffy, Collins, Tobler, Twiest, Rosen, and Speid). It is true, as UESF
asserts, that the remaining three teachers, Fireman, Harman and Riley Mendoza, are IRF’s
assigned to elementary schools and are junior to Ashley Freeman, the most senior K-5
classroom teacher subject to layoff. But, as UESF acknowledges in its brief, IRF’s are not
assigned to the classroom. IRF’s are not included in the PKS resolution’s category of K-5
classroom services. Fireman, Harman and Riley Mendoza were not improperly skipped.

Perhaps UESF’s argument is that the K-5 classroom teachers senior to Fireman,

Harman and Riley Mendoza should be able to bump into their positions as IRF’s. If that is
UESF’s argument, the evidence does not support it. Evangeline Sagastume, the district’s
Executive Director for Certificated Recruitment and Staffing, testified that particular
qualifications are necessary to be an IRF. Her testimony was credible and uncontradicted.
The burden is on the senior employee to demonstrate that he or she is qualified to bump into
the position of a junior employee. (Ed. Code, § 44955, subd. (b); Moreland Teachers Assn.
v. Kurze (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 648, 655.) No such evidence was offered by any teacher
providing K-5 classroom services.

Classification issues

13.

The district has classified the respondents identified on Appendix B as

temporary employees. Unlike permanent and probationary employees, temporary employees
are not entitled to the procedural protections granted by Education Code sections 44949 and
44955. (Ed. Code, §§ 44954, 44955, subd. (a).) The district sent the employees listed on
Appendix B “precautionary” layoff notices and served them with the accusation to allow
them to challenge their classification in this proceeding. None of these respondents
challenged his or her classification.

The parties stipulated that Endora Lee is a permanent employee and not

15.

The parties stipulated that the district will revise its records to reflect that

respondent Susanna Morgan is an art teacher, not a music teacher.

16.

The parties stipulated that the district will revise its records to reflect that

Mary Ann Skrivanich is an ELD teacher, not a literacy specialist.

Stipulations

14.
subject to layoff.

Other matters

17.

On or before March 15, 2010, the district gave written notice to respondents of

the recommendation that their services will not be required for the 2011-2012 school year.
The reasons for the recommendation were set forth in these preliminary layoff notices.

18.

Respondents filed timely requests for hearing to determine if there is cause for

terminating their services for the 2011-2012 school year. An accusation was served on
respondents, all of whom filed timely notices of defense. All prehearing jurisdictional
requirements have been met.

19.

The cause for the reduction in particular kinds of services relates to the welfare

of the schools and the pupils thereof.

20.

Except as otherwise permitted by statute, no permanent employee is being

terminated while any probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is
being retained to render a service which the permanent employee is certificated and
competent to render.

21.

Any contentions raised by respondents and not discussed above have been

found to be without merit and are hereby rejected.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

No cause exists to skip respondent Hannah Lingrell. (Finding 11.)

Cause exists to dismiss the accusation against respondent Endora Lee.

(Finding 14.)

Cause exists to order that the district’s records be corrected to reflect that

respondent Susanna Morgan is an art teacher, not a music teacher. (Finding 15.)

Cause exists to order that the district’s records be corrected to reflect that

respondent Mary Ann Skrivanich is an ELD teacher, not a literacy specialist. (Finding 16.)

The respondents identified on Appendix B have been classified as temporary

employees. (Finding 13.) Because the provisions of Education Code sections 44949 and
44955 apply only to probationary and permanent employees, the respondents shown on
Appendix B are not entitled to the protections afforded by those sections and it is not
necessary to decide whether there is cause for not reemploying them for the 2011-2012
school year. The district may, but is not required to, give them notice that their services will
not be required for the 2011-2012 school year.

6.

Cause exists because of the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of

services pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 to give notice to the
remaining respondents that their services will not be required for the 2011-2012 school year.
The cause relates solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof within the
meaning of Education Code section 44949.

ORDER

The accusation against respondent Endora Lee is dismissed.

The district shall correct its records to reflect that respondent Susanna Morgan

is an art teacher, not a music teacher.

The district shall correct its records to reflect that respondent Mary Ann

Skrivanich is an ELD teacher, not a literacy specialist.

kinds of services.
