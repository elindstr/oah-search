BEFORE THE
BOARD OF EDUCATION
CHINO VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
STATE OF CALIFORNIA

In the Matter of the Accusation Against:

OAH No. 2012020763

SHERRY ALVAREZ, et al.,

Respondents.

PROPOSED DECISION

On April 3, 2012, in Chino Hills, California, Alan S. Meth, Administrative Law

Judge, Office of Administrative Hearings, State of California, heard this matter.

Margaret A. Chidester and Ashleigh M. Rollins, Attorneys at Law, represented the

Chino Valley Unified School District.

Carlos R. Perez, Attorney at Law, represented the respondents set forth on Exhibit A

attached hereto.

Anthony Poletti represented himself.

At the hearing, the District withdrew the layoff notice and dismissed the accusations

against Lisa Bader, Daura Beard, Amber Condit, and Laura Iacopetti.

The matter was submitted on April 3, 2012.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

On March 6, 2012, Norm Enfield, Assistant Superintendent of the Chino
Valley School District (hereafter, “the District”), made and filed the accusations against
respondents in his official capacity.

2.

Respondents are certificated employees of the District.

1

3.

Before March 15, 2012, pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and

44955, Mr. Enfield notified the Board of Education (hereafter, “the Board”) of the District of
his recommendation that respondents be notified their services will not be required for the
ensuing school year. His notification to the Board set forth the reasons for the
recommendation.

4.

On or before March 15, 2012, each respondent was given written notice that

the Superintendent had recommended that notice be given to respondents, pursuant to
Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, that their services will not be required for the
ensuing year. Each written notice set forth the reasons for the recommendation. The notices
satisfied the requirements of sections 44949 and 44955. San Jose Teachers Association, Inc.
v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 632; Campbell Elementary Teachers Association v.
Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 803-04, distinguishing Karbach v. Board of Education
(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 355, 360-63.

5.

Each respondent timely requested in writing a hearing to determine if there is

cause for not reemploying them for the ensuing school year. Accusations were timely served
on respondents, and each respondent filed a timely Notice of Defense. All pre-hearing
jurisdictional requirements have been met.

6.

The Board on February 16, 2012 took action in Resolution No. 2011/2012-37

to discontinue certain services for the 2012-13 school year totaling 105.25 FTEs. On
March 8, 2012, the Board amended the resolution and adopted First Amended Resolution

The services set forth above are particular kinds of services which may be reduced or

discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955. California Teachers
Association v. Board of Trustees of the Goleta Union School District (1982) 132 Cal.App.3d
32, 34-37 and cases cited therein. See also San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen, supra at
635-38, in which the court specifically rejected the reasoning of Burgess v. Board of
Education (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 571; Zalac v. Governing Board (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838,
853-54.

Furthermore, these services may be reduced because of budgetary difficulties. Zalac

v. Governing Board, supra, and cases cited therein. The decision to reduce or discontinue
the services is neither arbitrary nor capricious but rather a proper exercise of the District's
discretion.

7.

No certificated employee junior to any respondent is retained to perform

services which any respondent is certificated and competent to render.

8.

The reduction or discontinuation of services is related to the welfare of the
District and its pupils, and it has become necessary to decrease the number of certificated
employees of the District as determined by the Board.

9.

The Board considered all known attrition, resignations, retirements and
requests for transfer in determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices to be
delivered to its employees.

Seniority List

10.

The District created a Seniority List which contains employees’ seniority dates

(first date of paid service), site, status, FTE, subjects, position title, credentials, and
authorizations. The District used the Seniority List to develop a proposed layoff of the least
senior employees currently assigned in the services being reduced. The District then

3

determined whether the least senior employees held credentials in another area and were
entitled to “bump” other employees. In determining who would be laid off for each kind of
service reduced, the District counted the number of reductions not covered by the known
vacancies, and determined the impact on incumbent staff in inverse order of seniority. The
District then checked the credentials of affected individuals and whether they could “bump”
other employees.

Nursing Services

11.

Norm Enfield, Ed.D, the assistant superintendent for human resources for the
District, testified on behalf of the District. He explained that the District was facing a deficit
of more than $1,900,000.00 over the ensuing two years, and that shortfall required the Board
to make cuts in services. One of the largest cuts the Board chose to make was in nursing
services; it eliminated 19 school nurse positions. He pointed out that several services nurses
provided for the District were mandated, such as vision screening, scoliosis screening,
maintaining health records, and so forth. With the elimination of school nurses, the District
looked into how other school districts in the area obtained nursing services. Mr. Enfield
testified that the human resources department contacted every school district in Orange and
San Bernardino counties, and found a wide variance in how they obtained nursing services.
Some districts used licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) and others contracted with other
agencies to provide the services.

Mr. Enfield testified the District had not decided how exactly it would provide the

nursing services required by statute. He indicated the District expected to train assistant
principals to perform vision screening and noted that LVNs were frequently used in other
districts to give insulin injection to diabetics. He expected that office staff would handle
parent notifications. In Mr. Enfield’s opinion, none of the services that nurses perform
required a school nurse credential.

Mr. Enfield testified that the reason the Board chose to entirely eliminate school

nurses was because of the contract the District had with its teachers. He explained that the
contract required a ratio of 2000 students or less to one school nurse, and that if the District
reduced the number of school nurses below the number needed to maintain that ratio, it
would not be in compliance with contract. One way to avoid that was to eliminate all the
nursing positions, and that is the road the Board chose.

12.

Susan Parks has been a school nurse with the District for 12 years. She

testified at the hearing and described the numerous services nurses perform for the District,
including medication management, training technicians and teachers, CPR and first aid
training, TB clinics, interacting with physicians, managing diabetics, providing specialized
treatment for students such as tracheotomies and epi pens, maintaining health records,
helping to develop IEPs, telephone triage, eye exams, and so forth. She testified that there is
a considerable difference in the level of expertise between an LVN, which requires only one
year of training and who must work under the supervision of a registered nurse, and a school
nurse who must be a registered nurse with a bachelor’s degree and a credential. She pointed
out that she has been a nurse for 34 years and worked in hospitals for 20 years. She did not

4

believe that a person could be trained to perform an eye exam in a six-hour course as the
District proposed.

Counseling Services

13.

The Board determined it would eliminate all of its counselors at the
elementary, junior high, and high school levels, including seven junior high school
intervention counselors. Mr. Enfield testified the reason the Board determined to eliminate
all counselors rather than reduce the number was the same as for nurses, i.e., a provision in
the contract that required a ratio of 450 students to one counselor. Again, rather than violate
the terms of the contract, the Board chose to eliminate all counseling positions.

Mr. Enfield described the services counselors currently performed and explained that
those services would be performed by other staff at the school site. He expected counseling
technicians would provide many of the services performed by counselors and other
administrators would perform services as they are able. He recognized it was not an ideal
solution and that some services performed by counselors would not be performed at all, but
he testified it saved a great deal of money and was necessary.

14.

Anna Purcell is a counselor at Chino High School and has served as a

counselor for 11 years. She testified that the services of a counselor are extremely important,
and in some cases involved life and death situations. She pointed out the counselors
schedule a student’s classes and more importantly, analyze what classes the student should
take. She noted that counselors are familiar with how colleges operate and with that
knowledge helped students make informed decisions about their futures. She testified that
she has a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree as well as a credential, and worked in
business for 15 years before becoming a school counselor. She did not believe that
counseling technicians or other school administrators were capable of performing the duties a
of credentialed counselor, and noted that technicians were clerical, data entry jobs performed
by classified employees who did not have the training and experience that counselors had.

Music Teachers

15.

Anne Robb is a band director at Townsend Junior High School with nearly

seven years of experience. She is subject to layoff by virtue of the Board’s decision to
reduce Elementary/Junior High Music Teacher by one FTE. She pointed out that will be
bumped from her position by Karen Cuen, who has nearly 19 years of seniority as a music
teacher at the elementary school level. They hold the same credential, music single subject.
Ms. Robb did not believe that the District should have allowed Ms. Cuen to bump into her
position because she is not as well qualified to perform the duties of a music teacher at a
junior high school. She testified that the position she holds is site specific and includes far
more than classroom duties. Ms. Robb testified she directs a class band, a marching band, a
color guard, a jazz band, a drum line, a choir, and a wind ensemble, and manages a staff of
five coaches. She added that she also does fundraising and oversees a budget of $65,000.00
that funds these activities. She indicated that there were several competitive programs that

5

she directed and they had been highly successful. She did not believe that Ms. Cuen had the
skills and the experience she had to perform all of these duties.

16.

Sean Jenkins is a music teacher at Magnolia, a band director, and works with

the marching band, a color guard, and a percussion program. He has nearly 10 years of
seniority with the District and has been teaching in this field for 15 years. He has a
bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree and is working toward a doctorate degree at USC.
He has been an assistant band director at USC. His position is subject to layoff, and he will
be bumped by Michael Noffsinger, who has been with the District since 1989. Mr. Jenkins
testified his position was heavy on instrumental music and believed that Mr. Noffsinger was
a chorale specialist and did not have the mastery of instrumental music that he had. He
believed he was more qualified than Mr. Noffsinger and should be retained.

17.

Laura Rutherford is the chorale director at Chino Hills High School and has a

bachelor’s degree with a chorale emphasis. She has been with the District for nearly eight
years, but will be bumped by Pamela Bell, who has been with the District for nearly 17 years.
She testified that Ms. Bell was a general music teacher and not as well trained as she is. She
testified she is an accomplished pianist and singer, and accompanies the choirs, thereby
avoiding the necessity of having to hire an accompanist.

18.

Douglas Jones teaches band at the elementary and junior high school levels.

He has a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in music and has been teaching since 1986.
He expressed his concern about the District’s decision to reduce the music programs at his
schools.

Reemployment

19.

Denise Prindiville teaches fifth grade at Dickson and worked as a temporary
teacher under a contract during the 2011-12 school year. She had been a permanent teacher
with the District but had been laid off a few years ago. She had a dispute with the District at
one time regarding her seniority date, but it has been corrected. The District’s seniority list
correctly reflects that her seniority date is August 28, 2002.

Ms. Prindiville testified that she is on the Temp-39 Month list as number 1301, but

believes she should be placed between number 893 and 894 on the seniority list to reflect her
seniority date.

Ms. Pindiville’s issue relates to the reemployment process. Her seniority date is

correct. Her issue is beyond the scope of this hearing.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Jurisdiction in this matter relating to the elimination of 116.25 full-time

equivalent positions exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. All notices and
jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied.

2.

Education Code section 44955 provides in relevant part:

. . .

“(b)
[W]henever a particular kind of service is to be reduced or discontinued not
later than the beginning of the following school year . . . and when in the opinion of
the governing board of the district it shall have become necessary . . . to decrease the
number of permanent employees in the district, the governing board may terminate
the services of not more than a corresponding percentage of the certificated
employees of the district, permanent as well as probationary, at the close of the school
year. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the services of no permanent employee
may be terminated under the provisions of this section while any probationary
employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to render a service
which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render. . . As
between employees who first rendered paid service to the district on the same date,
the governing board shall determine the order of termination solely on the basis of
needs of the district and the students thereof. Upon the request of any employee
whose order of termination is so determined, the governing board shall furnish in
writing no later than five days prior to the commencement of the hearing held in
accordance with Section 44949, a statement of the specific criteria used in
determining the order of termination and the application of the criteria in ranking each
employee relative to the other employees in the group. This requirement that the
governing board provide, on request, a written statement of reasons for determining
the order of termination shall not be interpreted to give affected employees any legal
right or interest that would not exist without such a requirement.

(c)

. . .

The governing board shall make assignments and reassignments in such a

manner that the employees shall be retained to render any service which their
seniority and qualifications entitle them to render. . .

(d)
Notwithstanding subdivision (b), a school district may deviate from
terminating a certificated employee in order of seniority for either of the following
reasons:

(1)

The district demonstrates a specific need for personnel to teach a

specific course or course of study, or to provide services authorized by a services

. . .

7

credential with a specialization in either pupil personnel services or health for a
school nurse, and that the certificated employee has special training and experience
necessary to teach that course or course of study or to provide those services, which
others with more seniority do not possess.

(2)

For purposes of maintaining or achieving compliance with

constitutional requirements related to equal protection of the laws.”

To put it more succinctly, a senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the

right to transfer to a continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to fill.
In doing so, the senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling
that position. See Lacy v. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469. Junior
teachers may be given retention priority over senior teachers if the junior teachers possess
superior skills or capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack. See Poppers v.
Tamalpais Union High School District (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 399; see also Santa Clara
Federation of Teachers, Local 2393, v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified School
District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831.

3.

A Governing Board may reduce, discontinue or eliminate a particular kind of
service and then provide the needed services to the students in another manner. (Hidlebrand
v. St. Helena Unified School District (2009) 172 Cal. App. 4th 334, 343; Gallup v. Board of
Trustees (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1571; California Teachers Association v. Board of Trustees
of Goleta Union School Dist. (1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 32; Campbell Elementary Teachers
Assn., Inc. v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 812.) A school board may reduce services
within the meaning of the statute either by determining that a certain type of service shall not
be performed at all or by reducing the number of district employees who perform such
services. (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 167.)

The District has chosen to eliminate all its counseling positions. Mr. Enfield testified
that the District intends to provide the requisite services in ways other than through the use of
employed counselors. Factual Finding 13. Respondents point to no statutory requirement
that the District must employ counselors. By utilizing non-counselors instead of counselors,
the district will be providing services in a different manner. The fact that the district does not
yet have a plan specifying how some of the counselors’ duties will be performed next year
does not mean that the district’s elimination of counseling positions is arbitrary and
capricious, as respondents seem to imply. Based upon Mr. Enfield’s representation that the
Board would provide the counseling services currently provided by its own employees, the
Board’s decision to eliminate all counseling positions must be upheld.

The same is true of nursing services. While it is readily apparent that the many
services performed by school nurses for the District and its students cannot be replaced, it is
only the mandated services that must be performed. Mr. Enfield’s testimony established that
mandated services will be performed by the District, but at this point it has not been
determined in precisely what manner. Factual Finding 11. That is sufficient to uphold the
Board’s decision to eliminate nursing services.

8

4.

The testimony offered by respondents relating to music raises several issues.
Ms. Robb, Mr. Jenkins, and Ms. Rutherford testified that, although they are junior teachers,
they should not be bumped by more senior teachers because they are better qualified to
provide services to the students of the District. In essence, their argument is that they should
be skipped under section 44955, subdivision (d). However, there is no requirement that a
school district must exercise the authority conferred on it by that section, and it is apparent
that the Board chose not to exercise it. In the absence of a decision by the Board to skip
junior teachers under subdivision (d), section 44955, subdivision (b) requires that the more
senior teachers be retained if they are certificated and competent to render the services. The
District’s seniority list establishes that the senior music teachers who bumped Ms. Robb, Mr.
Jenkins, and Ms. Rutherford were certificated and competent to render music services.
Accordingly, the layoffs of Ms. Robb, Mr. Jenkins, and Ms. Rutherford must be upheld.

5.

Any additional arguments offered by respondents have been considered and

are rejected.

6

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the District
to discontinue particular kinds of services relating to 116.25 full-time equivalent positions.
The cause for the reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related solely to
the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof. A preponderance of the evidence sustained
the charges set forth in the Accusation. It is recommended that the Board give respondents
notice before May 15, 2012, that their services will no longer be required by the District.

ORDER

1.

2.

The Accusations served on respondents Lisa Bader, Daura Beard, Amber

Condit, and Laura Iacopetti are dismissed.

The Accusations served on the respondents listed on Exhibit A are sustained.

Notice shall be given to each respondent before May 15, 2012 that his or her services will not
be required for the 2012-13 school year pursuant to the Board’s resolution because of the
reduction of particular kinds of services.

Notice shall be given in inverse order of seniority.
