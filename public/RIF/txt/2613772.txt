BEFORE THE 
BOARD OF TRUSTEES 
OF THE OLD ADOBE UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT 
SONOMA COUNTY 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 

In the Matter of the Statement of Reduction in Force of: 

ONE PERMANENT CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE, 

Respondent. 

OAH No. 2023040422 

PROPOSED DECISION 

Administrative Law Judge Michael C. Starkey, State of California, Office of 

Administrative Hearings (OAH), heard this matter on April 24, 2023, via 

videoconference. 

Attorney Loren W. Soukup represented Old Adobe Union School District, 

Sonoma County (District). 

Labor relations representative Jeremy Arnold represented respondent Paula 

Bernardini, who was present. 

The record was held open through April 24, 2023, for the District to submit 

copies of OAH proposed decisions relevant to a specific legal issue. Later in the day, 

the District submitted a letter and a copy of an OAH proposed decision, which was 

marked for identification as Exhibit 12. The matter was submitted on April 24, 2023. 

FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1. 

On March 3, 2022, the Board of Trustees of the Old Adobe Union School 

District (Board), adopted “Resolution No. 790” entitled “In the Matter of the 

Elimination of Certain Positions in the Permanent Classified Service and Directing 

Notification of Classified Employees” (Resolution No. 790), reducing or discontinuing 

particular kinds of services “as of the end of the 2023-2024 school year”1 due to “lack 

of work and/or lack of funds and/or for compliance with the seniority requirements of 

the Education Code,” and directing the District’s superintendent or designee to 

implement procedures necessary to eliminate the relevant positions. 

2. 

The services identified to be eliminated in Resolution No. 790 included: 

“Instructional Assistant, Classroom” (three 3.5-hours-per-day positions, one 

5.75-hours-per-day position, and one 6.3-hours-per-day position) and “Instructional 

Assistant, Academic Intervention” (one 4-hours-per-week position, one 

2-hours-per-week position, one 2.5-hours-per-week position, and one 

5-hours-per-week position). 

3. 

The services set forth in Resolution No. 790 are particular kinds of 

services that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code 

sections 45117 and 45308 (all further statutory references are to the Education Code 

unless otherwise stated). 

1 From context, including the notice to respondent, it is clear that the Board 

intended to eliminate these positions at the end of the current school year, prior to the 

beginning of the 2023-2024 school year. No party argued otherwise. 

2 

 
4. 

On or before March 15, 2023, the District personally served preliminary 

layoff notices and associated documents to all relevant classified employees except 

respondent Paula Bernardini. 

5. 

On March 15, 2023, Cindy Friberg, Co-Superintendent of the District, 

unsuccessfully attempted to personally serve a preliminary layoff notice upon 

respondent prior to respondent’s regular work hours. Friberg was aware of 

respondent’s regular work hours and provided no explanation for the timing of this 

attempt at personal service. 

6. 

Later on March 15, 2023, the District sent respondent a preliminary layoff 

notice letter with attached copies of relevant sections of the Education Code via 

certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to respondent’s residence. 

7. 

At approximately 6:15 p.m. on March 15, 2023, Friberg spoke with 

respondent via telephone and orally informed her of the intended layoff. 

8. 

On March 17, 2023, respondent received the preliminary layoff notice 

and attachments that were sent via certified mail on March 15, 2023. 

9. 

This preliminary layoff notice indicates that it was transmitted by 

personal delivery. Friberg explained that this is because she intended to serve it that 

way. 

10.  On March 24, 2023, the District received a written request for hearing 

from respondent, dated March 23, 2023. 

11.  On April 12, 2023, Friberg signed the District Statement of Reduction in 

Force in her official capacity as the Co-Superintendent of the District. 

3 

12. 

This proceeding followed. The sole issue in dispute is whether the District 

timely served respondent with the preliminary layoff notice. 

13. 

Respondent has been employed by the District for 17 months. She works 

at Miwok Valley Elementary School. Her primary duties are assisting the teacher in the 

classroom and working with students individually. 

14. 

The reductions in force set forth in Resolution No. 790 are necessary due 

to lack of funding and decreased enrollment. 

15. 

The District employed respondent in only two classifications: Instructional 

Assistant, Classroom (3.5 hours per day), and Instructional Assistant, Academic 

Intervention (5 hours per week). Respondent was the least senior classified employee 

of the District in the former classification and was a temporary employee in the latter 

classification. 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Section 45117, subdivision (a)(1), requires a school district to give written 

preliminary notice of a layoff to a classified employee “[n]o later than March 15.” 

Respondent argues that the District’s actions in this case did not constitute timely 

notice. The District argues that sending the preliminary layoff notice to respondent at 

her residence via certified mail, return receipt requested, on March 15, 2023, does 

constitute timely notice to respondent. Section 45117, subdivision (a)(1), is silent as to 

what manner of service will suffice. However, subdivision (c)(3)(A) states: 

Any notice or request shall be deemed sufficient when it is 

delivered in person to the employee to whom it is directed, 

4 

or when it is deposited in the United States registered mail, 

postage prepaid, and addressed to the last known address 

of the employee. 

Subdivision (c) primarily addresses procedures in the event a classified employee 

requests a hearing. However, the phrase “[a]ny notice” is expansive and unambiguous. 

Moreover, section 44949—a parallel statute applicable to the layoff of certificated 

employees—contains an identical sentence, but placed in its own subdivision, further 

supporting the view that this directive regarding the effectiveness of service by 

registered mail is applicable to all notices related to employee layoffs, not just those 

relating to hearing procedures. Accordingly, the District’s preliminary layoff notice to 

respondent in this matter was timely under section 45117, subdivision (c)(3)(A). 

(Factual Finding 6.) 

2. 

Cause to lay off respondent was not otherwise contested and was 

established via the evidence presented at hearing. (Factual Findings 1, 2, 3, 11, 14 and 

15.) 

3. 

Pursuant to sections 45117 and 45308, the District’s reduction in force 

must be sustained.
