FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Walt L. Hanline, Ed.D, Interim Superintendent, Denair Unified School

District (District), County of Stanislaus, State of California, filed the Accusation in his
official capacity.

2.

On July 17, 2013, the Governing Board (Board) of the District adopted

Resolution No. 071713R-29, that reduced and/or discontinued particular kinds of certificated
services (PKS) no later than the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year, in the amount of
14.78 full-time equivalent (FTE) certificated employee positions. The specific reductions
were as follows:

3.

The Board further determined that it shall be necessary by reason of the

reduction and/or discontinuance of services to decrease the number of permanent and/or
probationary certificated employees at the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year, and
directed the Superintendent to proceed accordingly by notifying the appropriate employees to
implement the Board’s determination.

4.

The Board’s Resolution referenced section 44955.5, recited below, which

authorizes a school district to terminate the services of certificated personnel if the district’s
total revenue limit per unit of average daily attendance has not increased by at least two
percent and the district’s governing board is of the opinion that it is therefore necessary to
decrease the number of certificated employees. The Board must act between five days after
the enactment of the Budget Act and August 15 of the fiscal year to which the Budget Act
applies.

5.

The Board’s Resolution also referenced section 44238.06, added to the
Education Code on July 1, 2013, which provides that effective July 1, 2013, except as

2

otherwise indicated and where the context requires otherwise, references to “revenue limit”
in the Education Code shall instead refer to the “local control funding formula” (explained
below).

6.

The Board’s Resolution stated that (1) the total local control funding formula
per unit of average daily attendance for fiscal year 2013-2014 had not increased by at least
two percent; and (2) it was therefore necessary to decrease the number of permanent
certificated employees in the District.

7.

8.

A Request for Hearing was timely filed by respondents to determine if there is

cause for not reemploying them for the next school year.

The Superintendent made and filed the Accusation against respondents after

respondents requested a hearing. The Accusation package included the required
accompanying documents and a blank Notice of Defense (Accusation packet) and was timely
served on respondents. Respondents filed timely notices of defense.

9.

At the administrative hearing, the parties stipulated that all procedural

requirements relating to service of the required notices were satisfied. The parties also
stipulated that assignments and reassignments (bumping) were properly considered in
accordance with a chart received in evidence as exhibit 20. The parties further stipulated that
exhibit 21 reflects the respondents whose positions will be eliminated or reduced in school
year 2013-2014, providing the District qualifies for the layoff procedure described in section
44955.5. The affected teachers are as follows:

Halla (Inga) Bernard
Cathy George
Sheila Gianfortone
Monica Gonzalez
Diana Hulbert
Korene Keene-Stark
Stephen Ladine

School Funding Changes Beginning Fiscal Year 2013-2014

10.

As part of the 2013-2014 budget package, the Legislature enacted major

changes to the way in which the state allocates funding to school districts. The changes are
incorporated in Chapter 47, Statutes of 2013 (AB 97). A major change was the movement
away from the total revenue limit per unit of average daily attendance (ADA) plus
“categorical funding,” to a system described as “local control funding formula” (LCFF).

3

Under LCFF, “target base rates” have been established to essentially reflect the amounts per
pupil that school districts would be getting today, but for the state’s general fund deficits and
its inability to fully fund the school districts.2 The base rates vary by grade levels with the
lowest base rates for kindergarten students, and then rising for grades 4-6, 7-8, and 9-12.
Most of the categorical funding has been eliminated and the amounts subsumed in the target
base rates. The formula also allows for percentage augmentations for K-3 students to help
fund class size reduction and for grades 9-12 to help fund career technical education. A
second component of the formula provides a 20 percent increase (“supplement”) for each
student satisfying one of three criteria: an English Learner (EL), low income student (LI)
defined as receiving free or reduced charge school meals, and foster children. If the district
has more than 55 percent EL/LI students, the district receives and additional 50 percent of
the adjusted base for each EL/LI student exceeding 55 percent (“concentration”). District,
with 53 percent of eligible students, does not receive the concentration augmentation.

11.

As noted, these funding figures are target rates, and because the state cannot

afford to fund the entirety of the undeficited rates, LCFF contemplates the payment of part of
the “gap” each year for eight years (approximately 12 percent) until the target is reached.
The target rates include annual cost of living increases as well and the cost of living raise for
fiscal year 2013-2014 is 1.57 percent.

12.

Because the goal is to restore districts to a position no less favorable than that

enjoyed before budget deficits in 2007-2008, plus cost of living increases, some districts
including Denair Unified School District also receive an Economic Recovery Target (ERT)
amount of approximately one-eighth of the amount calculated to ensure that they are not
disadvantaged by the new LCFF in comparison to what they would have received if the old
funding were maintained and fully funded at the end of the eight year period.

Application of the LCFF to District’s 2013-2014 Budget

13.

The parties were in agreement about most of the component numbers for the

District’s 2013-2014LCFF.3 As explained below, their disagreement involves the proper
interpretation of those numbers in the context of section 4499.5 read in conjunction with
Chapter 47.

14.

In order to calculate a baseline against which to measure the percentage
increase for budget year 2013-2014, the parties used the 2012-2013 revenue limit base
funding (ADA) of $5,354,264 and added to that number the total dollars for categorical
funding, $1,496,421, for a total of $6,850,685. Under LCFF, the target base grant for the
district is $7,389,877 and since the district has 53 percent of students eligible for the 20
percent increase, this adds another $768,598 for a total of $8,158,475. This leaves a gap of

2 Described as “undeficited school district revenue limit.”

3 The numbers and analysis were drawn from the respective experts called by the

parties and the documents received in evidence that both experts relied upon.

4

$1,307,790 between what district would receive if fully funded at the target level and the
base funding based on last year’s funding. As noted above, the state is only allocating
approximately 12 percent of the gap to school districts each year. This equates to an
additional $154,058 in funding for the current fiscal year, or an approximate 3.52 percent
budget increase for District.

15.

The new legislation contemplates that school districts that receive increased
funding based on eligible students (either the 20 percent or the 50 percent increases) shall
“increase or improve services for [such students] in proportion to the increase in funds
apportioned on the basis of the number and concentration of [such students] in the school
district…” (Ed. Code. § 42238.07, subd. (a)(1).) The State Board of Education is directed to
adopt regulations governing such apportioned expenditures by January 31, 2014, but no
regulations have yet been promulgated.

16.

District reasons that essentially all of the funds attributable to eligible students

should be regarded as “restricted” funds and excluded from the calculation of budget
increases. If this were done, the 3.52 percent increase would be reduced to 1.45 percent, less
than the threshold 2 percent. The District’s expert, Michael Ricketts, Associate Vice
President of School Services of California, Inc., explained why he chose to view the
percentage attributable to eligible students as 58.8 percent, rather than 53 percent. His
graphical display and charts reveal that he obtained that number by calculating what percent
of the gap ($1,307,790) the 20 percent increase ($768,598) reflected.4 The apparent rationale
for attributing a larger percentage to eligible students than their percentage of total students is
their ability to “earn” more for District by reason of the 20 percent supplemental allocation.5
However, this is only an academic issue, because it makes no difference whether one uses
the actual percentage of eligible students, 53 percent, or the 58.8 percent, as the Legal
Conclusions explain.

17. Mr. Ricketts also applied the 58.8 percent to reduce the amount received by
the District as its ERT, thereby decreasing the $87,362 to $35,993.6 Although Mr. Ricketts

4 One of Mr. Ricketts’s charts supporting his conclusions accurately reflects that
while eligible students account for 53 percent of the base grant for target funding, they
account for 100 percent of the 20 percent supplement.

5 The Administrative Law Judge calculated the percentage of the target amount

attributable to eligible students and the percentage is 57.4. As explained below, any
discrepancies in these numbers are essentially irrelevant, because Mr. Ricketts’s
consideration of all monies attributed to eligible students is based on flawed logic and an
incorrect application of section 44955.5.

6 In one of his charts, Mr. Ricketts inexplicably (from the Administrative Law Judge’s

perspective), attributes in excess of 80 percent of the ERT to eligible students. However, in
his chart used to try and demonstrate the errors in respondents’ analysis, he applied the 58.8
percent figure to exclude that portion of the ERT from consideration as a budget increase.

5

testified that it would be “prudent” to attribute that portion to eligible students as well,
District could identify no mandate to expend funds received as ERT in a manner proportional
to the number of eligible students. If ERT funds were not so reduced, even if one used Mr.
Ricketts’s 58.8 percent figure to reduce the gap funding ($154,058 – 58. 8 % = $63, 472)
and added that figure to the ERT total ($87,362 + 63,472 = $150,834) or a 2.2 percent budget
increase.

18.

Respondents’ expert Daniel Koen is a negotiator and budget analyst for the

California State Teachers’ Association. Like Mr. Ricketts, he is has been heavily involved in
the process of the adoption of the LCFF and assessing its ramifications. As noted above, Mr.
Koen and Mr. Ricketts used essentially the same budget figures in analyzing whether the
District’s 2013-2014 budget reflected at least a two percent increase over the previous year.
Mr. Koen concluded that the increase was approximately 3.30 percent. The main reason that
Mr. Koen reached a different conclusion than Mr. Ricketts was Mr. Koen’s treatment of the
supplemental dollars generated by eligible students. For purposes of comparison with the old
budgeting process, he treated the funds attributable to the 20 percent increase in the same
manner as categorical funds were treated under section 44955.5 under the old funding
system. He excluded them from consideration as “restricted” based on the proportionality
spending requirements explained above. Thus, while the overall budget increase is 3.52
percent, when the additional 20 percent earned by eligible students is eliminated from
consideration, the increase is 3.30 percent.

District’s Financial Situation

19. Whichever analysis one applies to a comparison of last year’s District budget
and that for 2013-2014, the District is receiving $241,420 more this year. However, District
has been designated by the Stanislaus Office of Education as being in a “negative
certification,” which denotes its inability to meet its financial obligations for last school year
and the current school year.

Prior Layoff Proceeding

20.

The District initiated an earlier layoff based on section 44955 that resulted in

a hearing on April 18, 2013, and the issuance of a Proposed Decision by another
Administrative Law Judge in the matter. Some of the same respondents were involved in
that case and the parties suggested that the validity of the Board’s decision in the matter is
being disputed. No issues relating to the prior matter were addressed in this proceeding, and
the Administrative Law Judge did not rely in any manner on factual findings or legal
conclusions reached in the earlier case.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

All notices and jurisdictional requirements were satisfied.

6

2.

As the parties have stipulated to the effect of the Board’s resolution to reduce

PKS and the respondents to whom notice shall be given of the elimination or reduction of
their services in 2013-2014 school year, the only remaining legal issue for resolution is the
District’s entitlement to use the layoff procedure provided in section 44955.5. For the
reasons outlined below, the District has not demonstrated that it meets the requirements to
conduct a section 44955.5 layoff.

3.

Section 44955.5 reads:

(a) During the time period between five days after the enactment
of the Budget Act and August 15 of the fiscal year to which that
Budget Act applies, if the governing board of a school district
determines that its total revenue limit per unit of average daily
attendance for the fiscal year of that Budget Act has not
increased by at least 2 percent, and if in the opinion of the
governing board it is therefore necessary to decrease the number
of permanent employees in the district, the governing board may
terminate the services of any permanent or probationary
certificated employees of the district, including employees
holding a position that requires an administrative or supervisory
credential. The termination shall be pursuant to Sections 44951
and 44955 but, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Sections 44951 and 44955, in accordance with a schedule of
notice and hearing adopted by the governing board.

(b) This section is inoperative from July 1, 2002, to July 1,
2003, inclusive, and from July 1, 2011, to July 1, 2012

4.

Section 42238.06, subdivision (a), reads:

Commencing on July 1, 2013, except for Sections 42238, 42238.1,
42238.2, and 42238.5, or where the context requires otherwise, all of
the following shall apply:

(a) References to ‘revenue limit’ shall instead refer to the ‘local control
funding formula.’

5.

For convenience, section 44955.5, subdivision (a), may now be read:

(a) During the time period between five days after the enactment
of the Budget Act and August 15 of the fiscal year to which that
Budget Act applies, if the governing board of a school district
determines that its total local control funding formula per unit of
average daily attendance for the fiscal year of that Budget Act
has not increased by at least 2 percent, and if in the opinion of

7

the governing board it is therefore necessary to decrease the
number of permanent employees in the district, the governing
board may terminate the services of any permanent or
probationary certificated employees of the district, including
employees holding a position that requires an administrative or
supervisory credential. The termination shall be pursuant to
Sections 44951 and 44955 but, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Sections 44951 and 44955, in accordance with a
schedule of notice and hearing adopted by the governing board.
(Underlining added.)

6.

The obvious problem presented in this case is the movement from the old

funding system to LCFF, resulting in an inevitable “apples and oranges” conundrum. Under
the old system, it was clear that to determine the level of budget increase, if any, one would
look exclusively at the ADA component (“total revenue limit per unit of average daily
attendance”) and exclude from consideration the approximately 20 percent of categorical
funding. This was not only compelled by the plain language of the statute, but also logical,
based on the restrictions imposed for funds allocated for very specific categorical purposes.

7.

A literal reading of section 44955.5, as “amended” by section 42238.06, might

render its application unworkable, because the LCFF did not exist in the previous year, and
there is therefore no basis for comparison. To avoid this result, the parties have endeavored
to devise analytical methods comparable to the old distinction between ADA and categorical
funding to measure the budget increase for this school year. To this end, each side has
attempted to quantify amounts of money allocated that are “restricted” in a manner similar to
the restrictions imposed on the spending of categorical funds and exclude those amounts in
the calculation of the budget increase for this school year.

8.

This approach finds support in the language of section 42238.07, subdivision

(a)(1):

(a) On or before January 31, 2014, the state board shall adopt
regulations that govern the expenditure of funds apportioned on
the basis of the number and concentration of unduplicated pupils
pursuant to Sections 2574, 2575, 42238.02, and 42238.03. The
regulations shall include, but are not limited to, provisions that
do all of the following:

(1) Require a school district, county office of education, or charter
school to increase or improve services for unduplicated pupils in
proportion to the increase in funds apportioned on the basis of the
number and concentration of unduplicated pupils in the school district,
county office of education, or charter school. (Underlining added.)

8

9.

While the Board of Education has not yet promulgated the required

regulations, the underlined language of section 42238.07 reflects a clear legislative mandate
that the increase in funds apportioned for eligible7 students should be devoted to increased or
improved services for such students.

10.

The differences in the analyses of the budget increases between District and

respondents are easily explained by their interpretation of what the experts referred to as the
“proportionality” requirement. District’s expert viewed the requirement as providing a
rationale for restricting (and excluding from consideration for purposes of assessing the
amount of the budget increase) all funds attributable to eligible students. Respondents’
expert regarded only the 20 percent supplement as restricted funds and thus not to be
considered in calculating the budget increase. Respondents’ view correctly applies the
language of the proportionality statute, because the statute refers to the “increase in funds”
on the basis of the number of eligible students. There is no reference to apportionment of the
base amounts attributable to eligible students.

11.

Not only is this interpretation consistent with the plain language of the statute,

it achieves a logical result, whereas District’s interpretation creates an illogical situation.
The very name of the new formula connotes the increased flexibility the Legislature sought
to provide school districts in contrast to the limitations of the old categorical funding system.
This is spelled out in the Legislative Counsel’s Digest to Chapter 47: “This bill would
authorize local educational agencies to expend, for any local educational purpose, the funds
previously required to be spent for specified categorical educational programs, including,
among others, programs for teacher training and class size reduction.” District’s
calculations are premised on the proposition that all funds attributable to eligible students
should only be used to provide services to them. This interpretation would limit a school
district’s budgeting flexibility even beyond the limitations imposed by categorical funding, at
least where more than 20 percent of students are eligible. Moreover, it would mean that the
higher the percentage of eligible students and therefore the increase in a school district’s
target and actual funding, the lower the percentage by which District would calculate the
budget increase. Under this model, the increase would eventually be calculated as zero. This
scenario would clearly run counter to the obvious purpose of Education Code section
44955.5, to allow a school district with only a modest budget increase to affect a layoff after
the budget is passed because of too little money to pay all of the costs related to teaching
staff. Here, District’s budget increase was 3.52 percent, well above the 2 percent threshold,
and even if one deducts the supplemental allocation for eligible students, the increase
exceeded 3 percent. The expenditure of the funds to pay for teachers would obviously
benefit all students, eligible and ineligible.

12.

District did not establish the necessary precondition for resort to the layoff

process contemplated by section 44955.5, as modified by section 42238.06. District argued

7 “Unduplicated” students refers to the three categories of students for which a district

receives the supplement or concentration funding, and conveys that they are only to be
counted once, even if meeting more than one criterion. (Educ. Code. § 2574, subd. (b)(2).)

9

that the determination of whether the two requirements contained in section 44955.5 were
met was left to the sound discretion of the Board. That is only true for the second
requirement: that less than a two percent increase necessitates a layoff “in the opinion of the
governing board.” The first requirement must be supported by facts and those facts were not
established in this matter.

The Accusation is dismissed.
