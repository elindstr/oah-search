FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

The  ALJ  makes  the  following  Factual  Findings: 

1. 

On  March  3,  2005,  complainant  found  and  resolved  that  a  reduction  in 

particular  kinds  of  services  (PKS)  provided  by  the  Orange  County  ACCESS 
Community  School  Program!  for  the  2005-2006  school  year  due  to  a  decline  in  the 
average  daily  attendance  in  ACCESS  program’.  (Exhibit  3.)  The  resolution  called  for 
a  reduction  in  services  equaling  74  Full-Time  Equivalent  (F.T.E.)  positions.  The 
resolution  called  for  the  following  reductions  in  particular  kinds  of  services: 

Programs/Services  Reduction 

  

Contract  Learning  Classes 
Day  School  Classes 
Special  Education  Classes 

Total 

- 

. 

FTE 

-  Reductions 

57.0 
15.0 
2.0 

74.0 

The  parties  do  not  dispute  the  fact  that  the  services  listed  above  are particular 

kinds  of  services,  which  may  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of 
Education  Code  section  44955. 

2. 

Complainant’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  services  listed  in 
Finding  1,  above,  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious;  rather,  it  is  due  to  the  decline  in 
average  daily  attendance;  and  is,  therefore,  a  proper  exercise  of  complainant’s 
discretion. 

3. 

The  reduction  and  discontinuation  of  services  is  related  to  the  welfare 

of  the  Orange  County  school  system  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to 
decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  as  determined  by  complainant. 

4. 

All  respondents  affected  by  the  layoffs  received  written  notice,  on  or 
before  March  15,  2005,  notifying  them  that  complainant  had  recommended  they  not 
be  re-employed in  the  upcoming,  2005-2006,  school year. 

  

The  ACCESS  Program  is  an  alternative  education  program  for  at-risk  youths  which  consists  of  two 

> 
components:  Contract  learning;  and  Day  School  programs. 
2 
Average  daily  attendance  in  the  ACCESS  Program  fluctuates  due  to  factors  such  as:.  school  districts 
served  by  the  Orange  County  ACCESS  Program  implementing  their  own  alternative  education  programs; 
decline  in  referrals  from  law  enforcement  agencies;  and  change  in  demographics,  generally.

5. 

Respondents  timely  submitted  their  requests  for  a  hearing  to  determine  | 

if  cause  exists  for  not  re-employing  them. 

6. 

On  March  9,  2005  the  Orange  County  Department  of  Education 

Assistant  Superintendent,  Human  Resources  and  Support  Services,  timely  notified 
respondents,  pursuant  to  California  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955,  of  the 
district’s  intent  not to  reemploy  them  for  the  upcoming  school  year.  That  same  date, 
March  9,  2005,  respondents  were  also  served  with  a  copy  of  complainant’  s  resolution, 
a  blank  “Request  for  Hearing”  and  other  related  materials. 

7. 

Subsequently,  on  March  28,  2005,  the  Accusation  and  related  materials 

were  served  on  each  respondent. 

. 

8, 

Each  respondent  either  timely  filed  Notices  of  Defense;  or,  if  not, 

complainant  waived  his  objections  to  untimely  filings. 

Each  respondent v was  properly  noticed  of  the  date,  time  and  place  of  the 

9. 
instant  hearing. 

10. 

11. 

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met...  - 

At  the  commencement  of  the  hearing  the  Accusation  was  dismissed  as 

to  the  following  five  respondents:  Joey  V.  Bahash;  Terra  D.  Bernard;  Paul  A.  Pabian; 
Michael  A.  Kashdan;  and  John  M.  Wells.  Additionally,  the  number  of  F.T.E. 
reductions  was  reduced  from  74  to  54,  based  on  attrition  (retirements, non-reelects, 
etc.). 

12... 

Complainant  properly  elected  to  skip  all  respondents  who  were. 
specially  trained  to  teach  special  education  programs  due  to  valid  needs  of  the 
_  ACCESS  Program  to  continue  providing  special  education  programs  to  its  special 

needs  students. 

_ 

13. 

The  respondents  identified  in  the  seniority  list,  Exhibit  7,  have  been 

selected  for  notice  of  layoff  pursuant  to  the  list,  which  is  based  on  the  first  day  of  paid 
service  of  each  respondent.  The  respondents  were  ranked  for  layoff  in  the  inverse  — 
order  of  their  date  of  employment.  It  was  not  necessary  for  complainant  to  apply  any 
tie-breaking  criteria  to  rank  these  employees. 

14. 

One  respondent,  Richard  Berman,  questioned  the  date  used  by 

complainant  as  his  “Seniority  Date.”  Mr.  Berman  believes  that  he  should  have 

_  received  credit  for  the  time  he  worked  as  an  “Individual  Intern.” 

  

3.  An  “Individual  Intern”  equates  with  “the  old  emergency  credential.”  .

15... 

Mr.  Berman  did  not  receive  any  credit  for  the  time  he  worked  under  his 

Individual  Intern/emergency  credential. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

2. 

Jurisdiction  for  the  instant  proceedings  exists  pursuant  to  Education 

Code  sections  44949  and  44955,  and  all  notices  and  other  requirements  of  those 
sections  have  been  provided,  as  required. 

The  services  listed  in  Factual  Finding  1  are  each  determined  to  be  a 

_  particular  kind  of  service  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955. 

3. 

Based  on  the  Factual  F indings,  considered  in  their  entirety,  cause  exists 

to  reduce  the  number  of  certified  employees  of  the  District  by  54.0  full-time 
equivalent  positions,  for  budgetary  reasons.  (Finding  11.) 

4. 

Cause  to  reduce  or discontinue  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of 

the  Orange  County  school  system  and  its  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education 
Code  section  44949.  (Finding  3.) 

5. 

Complainant  was  correct  in  not  granting  respondent  Berman  credit  for 

For  example,  under 

the  time  he  worked  on  an  emergency  or  Pre-Intern  basis. 
-  Education  Code  section  44911  time  spent  teaching  under  an  emergency  credential 
cannot  be  counted in  computing  an  employee's  progress  toward  permanent  status  unless  . 
the  employee  was  credentialed  in  another  state  and  demonstrated  adequate  basic  skills.” 
proficiency  pending  successful  completion  of the  California  Basic  Educational  Skills 
Test  (CBEST).  By  analogy  it  seems  that  the  same  principles  should  apply  to  accruing  | 
seniority  while  working  under  emergency  and  Pre-Intern  credentials.  (See  also 
Summerfield  v.  Windsor  Unified  School  District  (2002)  95  Cal.App.4"  1026.)
