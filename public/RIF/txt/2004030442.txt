Samuel  D.  Reyes,  Administrative  Law  Judge,  Office  of  Administrative  Hearings,  heard 

this  matter  on  April  14,  2004,  in  Covina,  California.

Assistant 

Marianne  Reinhold  and  Kate  Phillips,  Attorneys  at  Law,  represented  Respondents. 

The  District  has  determined  to  lay  off  certificated  employees  following  its  decision  to 
reduce  particular  kinds  of  services  pursuant  to  Education  Code!  section  44955.  The  District 
issued  layoff  notices  to  62  individuals  who  hold  teaching  certificates  in  order  to  achieve  the 
reductions,  18  of  which  notices  it  subsequently  rescinded.  The  District  did  not  issue  any  layoff 
notices  to  individuals  employed  pursuant  to  temporary  contracts  because  in  its  view  state  law 
does  not  require  it.  Several  of  the  temporary  employees  nevertheless  requested  hearings  and  8 
(Volodymyr  Babcezenko,  Laurence  Beyer,  Kelly  Eisenbise,  Christopher  Long,  Kristina  Paulson, 
Noel  Lee  Robertson,  Christopher  Rubio,  and  Alejandro  Valenzuela)  appeared  at  the  hearing  — 
references  to  “Respondents”  in  this  decision  include  these  8  individuals.  Respondents  dispute 
the  District’s  assertion  that  cause  exists  to  discontinue  their  services  for  the  2004-05  school  year 
and  argue  that  the  District’s  alleged  failure  to  properly  classify  all  certificated  employees, 
including  those  serving  under  emergency  or  internship  authorizations,  vitiates  the  entire  layoff. 

The  parties  presented  oral  and  documentary  evidence,  and  argument,  at  the  hearing.  The 
record  was  left  open  for  the  submission  of  written  briefs.  The  District  filed  a  post-hearing 
supplemental  brief  on  April  21,  2004,  and  a  post-hearing  reply  brief  on  April  23,  2004,  which 
documents  have  been  marked  for  identification  only  as  Exhibits  17  and  18.  Respondents  filed  a 
post-hearing  brief  on  April  22,  2004,  which  document  has  been  marked  as  Exhibit  B.  The 
matter  was  therefore  submitted  for  decision  on  April  23,  2004.

The  Board  adopted  Resolution  Number  08-03-04  on  March  9,  2004,  approving 

the  Superintendent’s  recommendation. 

5. 

On  or  about  March  10,  2004,  the  District  gave  each  Respondent,  except 
Respondents  Babczenko,  Beyer,  Eisenbise,  Long,  Paulson,  Robertson,  Rubio,  and  Valenzuela 
and 
the 
Superintendent’s  recommendation  that  Respondents’  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2004- 
05  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  or  elimination  of  particular  kinds  of  services.

of 

Respondents  filed  timely  requests  for  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for 

not  reemploying  them  for  the  2004-05  school  year. 

The  District  filed  and  served  an  Accusation  on  each  Respondent,  except  for 

Respondents  Babczenko,  Beyer,  Eisenbise,  Long,  Paulson,  Robertson,  Rubio,  and  Valenzuela. 

8. 

Respondents,  with  the  exception  of  Respondents  Babczenko,  Beyer,  Eisenbise, 

Long,  Paulson,  Robertson,  Rubio,  and  Valenzuela,  filed  timely  Notices  of  Defense. 

9. 

The  District  did  not  issue  layoff  notices  to  employees  working  pursuant  to  one- 
year  contracts,  such  as  Respondents  Babczenko,  Beyer,  Eisenbise,  Long,  Paulson,  Robertson, 
Rubio,  and  Valenzuela,  or  serve  documents  required  by  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 
44955  on  them,  because  it  views  them  as  temporary  employees  not  entitled  to  the  protections  of 
these  sections.  Seventeen  of  these  designated  temporary  employees,  including  Respondents 
Babczenko,  Eisenbise,  Long,  Paulson,  Robertson,  Rubio,  and  Valenzuela,  and  employees 
Andrea  Baiseri,  Teddi  Breaux,  Elizabeth  Diaz,  Amy  Drake,  Patricia  Santiago,  Teresa  Seely, 
Shari  Shultz-Salgado,  Camille  Strycula,  Joseph  Strycula,  and  Gregory  Zampiello,  nevertheless 
requested  a  hearing.  On  April  1,  2004,  the  District  wrote  a  letter  to  these  employees  denying 
their  request  for  hearing,  stating,  in  essence,  that  as  temporary  employees  they  were  not  entitled 
a  hearing.  Only  Respondents  Babczenko,  Beyer,  Eisenbise,  Long,  Paulson,  Robertson, 
to 
Rubio,  and  Valenzuela  appeared  at  the  hearing. 

10. 

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met.

are  particular  kinds  of 

13. 

The  District  has  been  impacted  by  the  state’s  fiscal  crisis.  Its  anticipated  funding 
was  reduced  by  $2.4  million  before  the  2003-04  school  year  and  is  expected  to  drop  an 
additional  $1.9  million  before  the  2004-05  school  year.  The  District  was  able  to  avoid 
certificated  employee  layoffs  for  the  2003-04  school  year  but  has  concluded  it  can  no  longer 
avoid  them.  The  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  services  in  light  of  the  declining 
revenue  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious  but  is  rather  a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion. 

14. 

The  reduction  of  services  is  related  to  the  welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils, 
and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  by  47  FTE 
positions  as  determined  by  the  Board  and  its  designees. 

a. 

15. 

The  District  seeks  to  exempt  from  layoff;  or  “skip”  in  the seniority  order, 
certain  certificated  employees  deemed  to  possess  special  training,  experience,  or  credentials. 
These  individuals  hold  administrative,  special  education,  language-speech-hearing,  math, 
science,  English,  Spanish,  or  psychologist  credentials  or  authorizations.  In  addition  to  holding 
the  credentials  or  authorizations,  the  individuals  the  District  seeks  to  exempt  from  layoff 

 

worked  in  positions  requiring  the  credentials  or  authorizations  in  question  during  the  2003-04 
school  year  and  are  expected  to  again  hold  the  positions  during  the  2004-05  school  year.”  As  a 
precaution,  the  District  has  given  layoff  notices  to  the  following  Respondents  whom  it  actually 
seeks  to  exempt:  Glenda  Bangle;  Ana  Bernal;  Nicole  Bucka;  Dianne  Dunne;  Lani  Ellington; 
Brett  Hall;  Michelle  Klein;  Robert  Mancilla;  Frank  Martinez;  Nancy  Maynard;  Nathan  Nichols; 
Christopher  Pirraglia;  Michelle  Ronga;  and  Catherine  Strother.’ 

b. 

Respondents  did  not  challenge  the  exempted  teachers’  special  training, 
experience,  or  credentials,  or  the  District’s  need  for  such  experience.  Nor  did  any  Respondent 
establish  he/she  possessed  the  desired  special  training,  experience  or  credential. 

C. 

The  District  has  established  that  it  is  in  the  interest  of  the  District  and  its 
pupils  to  skip  the  individuals  in  question  because  they  possess  special  training  and  experience 
to  meet  a  District  need. 

16. 

The  District  has  taken  into  account  positively  assured  attrition  since  March  10, 
2004  (a  total  of  18  full-time  equivalent  positions),  and  rescinded  layoff  notices  issued  to  the 
following  individuals:  William  Austin;  Maria  Bernal;  John  Boyle;  Aubrey  Brinegar;  Jennifer 
Jennifer  Graves;  Margaret  Godinez;  David  Hedrick;  Emily 
Fetchik;  Deborah  Fillinger; 
Lambert;  Denise  Montes;  Selena  Patton;  Stacey  Burroughs  Ryan;  Karen  Tanaka;  Teresa 
Tiffany;  Sandie  Wilkerson;  Scarlett  Wingate;  and  Laurie  Zernickow. 

17. 

The  Board  has  adopted  criteria  to  break  ties  among  those  who  first  rendered  paid 
service  on  the  same  date.  Respondents  have  not  challenged  the  derivation  or  application  of  the 
criteria. 

It 

18. 

is  the  District’s  policy  to  hire  individuals  who  hold  emergency,  pre-intern, 
intern,  or  waiver  authorizations  (referred  collectively  as  provisional  credentials,  permits  or 
authorizations  in  this  Decision)  pursuant  to  temporary  employment  contracts.  It  used  four  form 
contracts  during  the  2003-04  school  year,  one  for  intern  credential  teachers,  one  for  pre-intern 
credential  teachers,  one  for  emergency  permit  teachers,  and  one  for  all  others  (referred  herein  as 
the  “generic”  temporary  contract).  The  first  three  contracts  are  intended  for  use  to  employ 
teachers  who  hold  provisional  contracts  and  all  four  refer  to  employment  limitations. 

  

Although  the  District  has  not  decided  which  of  its  employees  currently  working  pursuant  to  one-year  contracts  it 
will  reemploy  for  the  2004-05  school  year,  15  employees  in  the  exempted  services  hold  emergency  or  intern 
certificates  and  may  be  retained. 

*  Also  receiving  “precautionary”  notices  but  not  requesting  a  hearing  are  Cindy  Berglund,  Lois  Magdy  Zaki 
Daow,  Jennifer  Evans,  Sylvia  Jones,  Jimmy  Kuo,  Jennifer  Maletz,  Rebecca  McCauley,  Eileen  Romero, 
Rosario  Sabillo,  Luiza  Shamuradova,  and  Sharon  Zerpoli.

  

The  intern  temporary  contract  states  that  “Pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Ed.  Code 
Section  44466,  service  by  a  person  on  an  Intern  credential  shall  not  acquire  tenure”  and 
provides  that  employment  may  be  terminate  at  any  time.  The  pre-intern  contract  states  that 
“Pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Ed.Code  Section  44911,  service  by  a  person  as  a  temporary 
teacher  (pre-intern  certificate)  does  not  provide  status  toward  tenure”  and  that  “employment  is 
on  a  day  to  day  basis  and  subject  to  termination  during  the  school  year  at  any  time.”  The 
emergency  permit  teacher  contract  contains  the  same  tenure  limitation  quoted  with  respect  to 
the  pre-intern  teacher  contract,  except  that  the  reference  is  to  emergency  permit  teachers.  The 
generic  temporary  employment  contract  also  provides  that  “employment  is  on  a  day-to-day 
basis  and  subject  to  termination  during  the  school  year”  and  contains  the  following  language: 

The  generic  temporary  contracts  contain  the  following  statement: 

“The  Governing  Board  of  the  Charter  Oak  Unified  School  District  of  Los 
Angeles  County,  California  offers  you  employment  as 
a  temporary 
certificated  employee  due  to  one  or  more  of  the  following  circumstances: 
1)  It  has  been  determined  that  a  need  exists  for  additional  certificated 
employees  during  the  2003-2004  school  year:  2)  certificated  employees 
have  been  granted  leaves  of  absence;  3)

During  the  2003-04  school  year,  the  District  hired  49  certificated  employees  to 
temporary  contracts  -three  others  previously  hired  as  temporary  employees  were  on  leave 
during  the  school  year.  Respondents  Babezenko,  Beyer,  Eisenbise,  Long,  Paulson,  Robertson, 
Rubio,  and  Valenzuela  signed  their  employment  contracts  in  June  2003,  prior  to  the  start  of  the 
2003-04  school  year  and  prior  to  performing  work  for  the  District  for  the  2003-04  school  year. 
Respondents  Babczenko,  Long,  and  Rubio  entered  into  temporary  (intern  credential)  teacher 
contracts  and  Respondent  Robertson  entered  into  a  temporary  (emergency  permit  teacher) 
contract.  Respondents  Beyer, 
and  Valenzuela  entered  into  generic 
temporary  contracts, 
despite  holding  intern  (Valenzuela)  or  emergency  permits  (Beyer, 
Eisenbise,  and  Paulson).  All  8  contracts  were  for  full  time  employment.

Beyer  held  an  emergency  multiple  subject  permit,  which  expired  December  2003.  His 
credential  school  submitted  an  application  for  a  preliminary  credential  in  July  2003,  which  was 
received  by  the  Commission  of  Teacher  Credentialing  (“CTC”)  on  July  23,  2003.  The  CTC 
issued  a  preliminary  multiple  subject  credential  in  December  2003,  but  the  credential  has  not 
been  provided  to  the  District  or  registered  with  the  Los  Angeles  County  Department  of 
Education.

The  district  does  not  include  service  performed  pursuant  to  a  temporary  contract 
in  its  seniority  calculations.  Thus,  the  employees  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number  20  have  a 
“hire  date”  but  no  “seniority  date.”  Also,  employees  who  obtain  a  preliminary  or  clear 
credential  during  the  school  year  are  not  reclassified  as  probationary  or  obtain  a  seniority  date 
consistent  with  acquisition  of  the  new  credential.  Rather,  if  retained  for  the  following  school 
year,  the  certificated  employee  is  offered  a  probationary  contract  at  that  time  and  the  hire  date  at 

the  start  of  the  new  school  year  is  deemed  the  seniority  date.

held  by  these  two  employees  during  their  first  year  of  employment  or  the  type  of  assignment 
was  not  established  at  the  hearing.  Therefore,  it  was  not  established  that  Zernickow  or 
Burroughs  Ryan  worked  as  probationary  employees  during  the  2000-01  school  year  and, 
therefore,  their  seniority  dates  are  those  assigned  by  the  District.

1, 

Jurisdiction  for  the  subject  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  sections  44949  and 

44955,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  1  through  10.

Cause  exists  to  reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  by  47

that 

Section  44955  directs  that  certificated  permanent  and  probationary  employees 
are  to  be  laid  off  by  seniority,  consistent  with  their  qualifications  and  status.  Thus,  subsection 
(c)  provides,  in  pertinent  part, 
“the  governing  board  shall  make  assignments  and 
reassignments  in  such  manner  that  employees  shall  be  retained  to  render  any  service  which  their 
in  subsection  (b),  gives 
seniority  and  qualifications  entitle  them  to  render.”  The  statute, 
preference  to  permanent  employees:  “Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  statute,  the  services  of 
no  permanent  employee  may  be  terminated  under  the  provisions  of  this  section  while  any 
probationary  employee,  or  any  other  employee  with  less  seniority,  is  retained  to  render  a  service 
which  said  permanent  employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render.”  Districts  are  permitted 
to  disregard  seniority  in  two  specific  instances: 

“(d)  Notwithstanding  subdivision  (b),  a  school  district  may  deviate  from 
terminating  a  certificated  employee  in  order  of  seniority  for  either  of  the 
following  reasons: 

(1)  The  district  demonstrates  a  specific  need  for  personnel  to  teach  a 
specific  course  or  course  of  study,  or  to  provide  services  authorized  by  a 
services  credential  with  a  specialization  in  either  pupil  personnel  services 
or  health  for  a  school  nurse,  and  that  the  certificated  employee  has  special 
training  and  experience  necessary  to  teach  that  course  of  study  or  to 
provide  those  services,  which  others  with  more  seniority  do  not  possess.

The  parties  disagree  about  the  type  of  service  that  can  be  considered  in  determining 
seniority.  District  maintains  that  only  time  served  in  a  status  that  can  be  counted  toward  tenure 
can  be  considered.  Respondents  argue  that  any  time  served  in  a  probationary  capacity  should  be 
counted  for  the  purpose  of  sections  44949  and  44955.  Further  disagreement  exists  regarding  the 
definition  of  probationary  status.  District  states  that  only  those  employees  earning  credit  toward 
tenure  can  be  considered  probationary.  Respondents  counter  that  any  certificated  employee  not 
classified  as  temporary,  substitute,  or  permanent  must  be  classified  as  probationary.

The  Education  Code  establishes  four  possible  classifications  for  certificated 
employees:  permanent;  probationary;  temporary;  and  substitute.  Kavanaugh  v.  West  Sonoma

a  position  requiring

qualifications  are  established  by  or  pursuant  to  Sections  44000  to  44012,  inclusive,  Section

Service  pursuant  to  certain  credentials  may  not  be  counted  toward  permanent  status. 
Thus,  section  44911  provides,  in  pertinent  part:  “Service  under  a  provisional  credential  shall 
not  be  included  in  computing  the  service  required  as 
or 
a  permanent  employee  of  a  school  district.”  The  Court  in

Substitute  employees  as  “those  persons  employed  in  positions  requiring  certification

44917. 

Temporary  employees  are  those  not  hired  as  substitute  employees  to  serve  on  a  day  to 
day  basis  in  temporary  classes  (section  44919).  A  district  may  also  employ  temporary 
employees  to  fill  positions  of  certificated  employees  who  are  absent  because  of  a  leave  of 
absence  or  long-term  illness  (Section  44920).  No  statutory  provision  defines  temporary 
employees  in  terms  of  the  type  of  credential  held. 

In  interpreting  statutes  it  is  essential  to  ascertain  the  intent  of  the  Legislature  so  as  to 
effectuate  the  purpose  of  the  law.  California  Teachers  Association  v.  Governing  Board  of 
Rialto  Unified  School  District,  14  Cal.4"  627,  632  (1997);  People  v.  Hull,  1  Cal.4™  266,  271 
(1991);  Steketee_v.  Lintz,  Williams  &  Rothberg,  38  Cal.3d  46,  51  (1985).  In  determining 
intent,  courts  first  look  to  the  words  contained  in  the  statute,  giving  them  their  plain  meaning. 
Kavanaugh,  supra,  at  p.919;  Hull,  supra  at  p.  271;  Steketee,  supra  at  pp.  51-52;  Welch  v. 
Oakland  Unified  School  District,  91  Cal.App.4"  1421,  1430-31  (2002).  If  necessary,  canons 
of  statutory  construction  can  assist  in  discerning  the  correct  interpretation  of  statutory 
language.  Thus,  “[a]  statute  must  be  construed  in  the  context  of  the  entire  statutory  system  of 
which  it  is  a  part,  in  order  to  achieve  harmony  among  the  parts  [Citations].”  Hull,  supra  at  p. 
272;  Kavanaugh,  supra  at  p.  919.

Section  44915  must  be  read  with  the  foregoing  principles  in  mind.  Thus,  the  statute 
classifies  as  probationary  employees  those  “employed  in 
[a]  position  requiring  certification 
qualifications”  not  classified  as  “permanent”  or  “substitute.”  Section  44915  refers  to  the 
positions  held  by  the  employee  in  question,  not  to  the  type  of  credential  held.  Section  44001,  in 
turn,  broadly  defines  the  positions  to  include  all  those  for  which  CTC  issues  a  certificate  or 
permit.  There  is  no  dispute  that  all  Respondents,  including  those  holding  emergency  permits  or 
intern  credentials,  worked  in  positions  requiring  certification  qualifications;  they  in 
fact 
discharged  their  duties  while  holding  credentials,  permits,  and  authorizations  issued  by  CTC. 
Nor  is  there  disagreement  that  Respondents  did  not  work  as  substitutes  or 
as  permanent 
employees.  Accordingly,  giving  the  words  of  section  44915  their  plain  meaning  requires 
classification  of  Respondents  as  probationary  employees. 

District  argues a  literal  construction  of  section  41915  is  inappropriate.  In  Golden  Valley, 
98  Cal.App.4""  369  (2002),  however,  an  appellate  court  similarly  construed  the  plain  meaning  of 
section  44915  with  respect  to  emergency  permit  teachers  in  an  analogous  context.  In  so  doing, 
the  court  reviewed  the  history  and  context  of  section  44915  and  provisions  pertaining  to 
emergency  credentials. 

In  Golden  Valley,  a  teacher  who  had  worked  pursuant  to  an  emergency  permit  during 
the  1998-99  school  year  entered  into  a  probationary  contract  for  the  1999-00  school  year.  On 
August  3,  1999,  after  the  start  of  the  1999-00  school  year,  the  successor  district,  Golden  Valley 
Unified  School  District,  terminated  the  teacher  for  failing  to  have  a  preliminary  or  clear 
credential.  The  court  held  that  the  teacher  was  a  probationary  employee  under  section  44915 
entitled  to  the  protections  against  mid-term  termination  such  status  confers.  In  so  holding,  the 
court  rejected  the  argument  that  the  teacher  was  not  a  probationary  employee,  and  thus  not 
entitled  to  protection  from  midyear  dismissals,  because  she  held  an  emergency  permit. 

The  court  in  Golden  Valley  traced  the  inception  of  emergency  credentials  to  the  World 
War  II  period,  when  the  war  effort  created  a  shortage  of  qualified  teachers.  At  the  time,  a  statute 
required  employment  “in  positions  requiring  certification  qualifications”  for  an  employee  to  be 
classified  as  substitute,  probationary  or  permanent.  The  Legislature  enacted  a  provision  in  1943 
in  order  to  prevent  service  under  an  emergency  credential  from  counting  towards  attainment  of 
permanent  status.  As  the  Golden  Valley  court  observed,  enactment  of  the  exclusion  was 
“necessary  only  if  the  Legislature  believed  that  service  under  an  emergency  credential  could 
include  employment  ‘in  position[s]  requiring  certification  qualifications.’””  Golden  Valley, 
supra  at  p.  380.  The  court  noted  that  the  tenure  exclusion  was  the  only  one  enacted  and  that  the

The  language  in  present  section  44915  has  remained  the  same  despite  reenactment  of  the

Analogously,  just  as  the  Legislature  did  not  exclude  teachers  holding  emergency  permits 
from  the  midyear  dismissal  protections  probationary  teachers  enjoy,  it  did  not  exclude  these  or 
other  provisionally-credentialed  teachers  from  the  yearend  layoff  protections  afforded  by 
sections  44949  and  44955.  Thus,  giving  the  words  of  section  44915  their  plain  meaning  is

of  teachers  holding  provisional  credentials,  harmonizes  sections  44911,  44915,  44949  and 
44955,  and  is  in  accord  with  the  only  published  appellate  decision  to  have  construed  section 
44915. 

7, 

By  subsequent,  more  specific  statute,  the  Legislature  denied  layoff  protections  to 
a  group  of  individuals  holding  provisional  credentials,  namely,  those  holding  internship 
credentials  pursuant  to  sections  44450  through  44468.  These  individuals  are  typically  called 
“university  interns”  to  distinguish  them  from  “district  interns.”  The  District  only  employs 
university  interns,  including  Respondents  Babczenko,  Long,  Rubio,  and  Valenzuela.  Section 
44464  provides,  in  pertinent  part,  that  “the  rights  provided  by  Sections  44948  and  44949  shall 
not  be  afforded  to  interns.”*  Inasmuch  as  section  44464  is  a  more  specific  statute,  it  must  be 
construed  as  also  modifying  section  44915  with  respect  to  the  layoff  rights  of  interns.  See:  San 
Francisco  Taxpayers  Association  v.  Board  of  Supervisors,  2  Cal.4"  571,  577  (1992);  In re 
Michael  G.,  44  Cal  3d  283,  293  (1988);  In  re  Misener,  38  Cal.3d  543,  553,  fn  4  (1985); 
Bailey  v.  Superior  Court,  19  Cal.3d  970,  976-977,  fn  8  (1977).  By  analogy,  those  holding 
pre-intern  certificates  pursuant  to  section  44305  et  seq.  who  are  working  toward  an  internship 
certificate  should  be  excluded  from  the  protections  of  the  layoff  statutes.  Therefore, 
Respondents  Babczenko,  Long,  Rubio,  and  Valenzuela,  are  not  entitled  to  the  protection  of 
section  44949,  and  Respondents  who  provided  services  in  a  certificated  position  under  intern  or 
pre-intern  certificates  may  not  receive  credit  for  such  service  for  the  purpose  of  layoff  seniority. 

8. 

The  parties  also  disagree  regarding  the  impact  of  the  most  recent  reported 
appellate  case  pertaining  to  the  status  of  certificated  employees,  Fine,  supra.  District  argues  that 
Fine  held  that  emergency-permitted  teachers  are  not  probationary  employees.  Respondents,  on 
the  other  hand,  argue  that  Fine  affirms  the  holding  in  Golden  Valley  that  emergency  permit 
holders  are  entitled  to  the  benefits  of  probationary  classification  except  for  service  credit  toward 
seniority.  However,  Fine  did  not  involve  classification  of  probationary  employees  for  layoff 
purposes  and  is  not  as  helpful  as  the  parties  maintain. 

In  Fine,  an  employee  working  pursuant  to  an  emergency  permit  received  a  preliminary 
credential  in  late  February  2000,  which  was  valid  from  August  27,  1999  to  September  1,  2004. 
She  provided  the  credential  to  the  district  on  March  8,  2000,  and  signed  a  probationary 
employee  contract  on  that  date.  The  employee  had  been  working  pursuant  to 
a  one-year 
contract  as  a  provisional  teacher.  On  March  14,  2002,  the  district  issued  a  notice  of  non- 
reelection  pursuant  to  section  44921.21(b).  The  teacher  argued  that  the  notice  was  untimely  as 
she  had  worked  in  a  probationary,  or  alternatively,  temporary  capacity  from  the  effective  date 
of  her  credential;  in  either  case,  Fine  argued,  she  had  worked  as  a  probationary  employee  for 
almost  3  years  and  had,  in  effect,  become  a  permanent  employee.  The  court  stated  that  the 
matter  involved  construction  of  section  49911  and,  in  particular,  whether  service  between 
August  27,  1999,  and  March  8,  2000,  was  service  “under  a  provisional  credential”  not  entitled

to  tenure  credit  under  the  section.  The  court  answered  the  question  in  the  affirmative  and  denied 
tenure  credit.  The  instant  matter,  however,  involves  seniority  for  layoff  purposes,  not  seniority 
for  tenure  purposes.  Further,  Respondents  do  not  claim  they  are  permanent  employees  or 
otherwise  entitled  to  credit  toward  permanent  status  for  service  under  a  provisional  credential. 

The  court  in  Fine  quoted  section  44915  and  stated:  “Thus,  while  Fine  served  under  her 
emergency  permit,  she  was  apparently  entitled  to  classification  as  a  probationary  employee,  for 
purposes  other  than  attaining  tenure.  One  court,  construing  section  44915,  has  so  held.”  The 
court  thereafter  cited  Golden  Valley  and  discussed  its  reasoning.  The  Fine  court  did  not  adopt 
or  reject  the  Golden  Valley  holding,  neither  of  which  was  required  for  resolution  of  the  tenure 
issue  before  it. 

9. 

The  District  argues  that  only  employees  whose  probationary  service  counts 
toward  tenure  can  be  considered  probationary.  It  relies  on  section  44911  and  on a  recent 
95 
decision  construing  the 
Cal.App.4"  1026  (2002),  which  clearly  hold  that  service  under  a  provisional  credential, 
including  an  emergency  permit,  cannot  be  included  in  computing  the  time  required  for 
classification  as  a  permanent  employee.  Respondents  do  not  dispute  the  import  of  44911  or 
Summerfield,  but  maintain  that  inability  to  accrue  credit  for  tenure  does  not  prevent  the  accrual 
of  seniority  for  other  purposes,  such  as  layoff  under  sections  44949  and  44955. 

section,  Summerfield  _v.  Windsor  Unified  School  District, 

The  Court  in  Golden  Valley  noted  that  probationary  classification  provides  two  primary 
benefits:  employees  generally  receive  credit  toward  the  two-year  probationary  period  required 
before  an  employee  is  classified  as  permanent;  and  districts  are  restricted  in  the  ways  they  may 
end  the  employment  of  a  probationary  employee.  The  Court  held  that  termination  protections 
were  available  to  emergency-permitted  employees  even  if  the  other  primary  benefit  of 
probationary  status,  service  credit  toward  tenure,  was  not.  In  so  holding,  the  Golden  Valley 
court  properly  distinguished  Summerfield  on  the  basis  that  it  involved  a  different  benefit  of 
of 
probationary  classification. 
probationary  status,  namely,  certain  protections  in  the  event  of  termination  by  layoff.’  Neither 
section  44911  nor  Summerfield  preclude  probationary  classification  pursuant  to  44915  or  layoff 
protection  pursuant  to  44949  and  44955  for  teachers  holding  non-intern  provisional  credentials. 

case  involves  other  benefits 

As  in  Golden  Valley, 

this 

10. 

Respondents  were  not  hired  under  any  of  the  provisions  specifically  authorizing 
temporary  employees.  Thus,  Respondents  were  not  hired  for  temporary  classes,  as  section 
44919  permits  or  as  temporary  replacements  for  certificated  employees  on  leave  of  absence  or 
on  long  term  illness  leave,  as  section  44920  permits.  Rather,  Respondents  worked  full  time 
assignments  in  regular  classrooms.  Therefore,  they  are  not  temporary  employees. 

  

°  While  the  termination  benefit  involved  in  Golden  Valley  was  not  exactly  the  same  as  that  in  this  case,  i.e.,  mid- 
year  termination  for  cause  instead  of  layoffs  at  the  end  of  the  year,  this  difference  is  not  material.  Both  cases 
involve  rights  of  probationary  employees  in  the  event  of  termination. 

14  

The  court  in  Fine  reached  a  similar  conclusion  in  addressing  the  teacher’s  alternative 
argument.  The  employee  argued  that  even  if  her  1999-00  service  was  deemed  under  a 
provisional  credential,  she  was  nevertheless  a  temporary  employee,  whose  status  was  changed 
by  operation  of  law  upon  retention  as  a  probationary  employee  for  the  2000-01  school  year. 
The  court  reasoned  that  sections  44917,  44918,  44919,  and  44920  specifically  define  temporary 
employees  and  that  Fine,  as  a  teacher  working  under  a  provisional  credential,  was  not  covered 
by,  or  specifically  employed  pursuant  to,  any  of  these  statutes. 

11. 

The  District  nevertheless  argues  that  Respondents  may  properly  be  designated  as 
temporary  employees  by  contract,  a  classification  they  accepted  by  entering  into  the  contracts. 
However,  a  contract  may  not  be  used  to  abrogate  a  clear  legislative  mandate.  Fine,  supra  at 
76 
1079;  Santa  Barbara  Federation  of  Teachers  v.  Santa  Barbara  High  School  District, 
Cal.App.3d  223,  227-228  (1977).  In  this  case,  as  set  forth  in  legal  conclusion  number  6,  section 
44915  requires  classification  of  Respondents  as  probationary  employees,  which  legislative 
mandate  is  clear  and  may  not  be  contractually  abrogated. 

12. 

The  District  argues  that  granting  probationary  status  to  those  teaching  pursuant 
to  emergency  permits  would  lead  to  the  anomalous  result  of  retaining  these  individuals  over 
less  senior,  but  fully-credentialed  teachers.  This  would  be  the  case  has  the  Legislature  chosen  to 
define  probationary  employees  in  terms  of  type  of  credential  held  instead  of  type  of  work 
performed.  Given  the  language  used  in  section  44915,  and  the  lack  of  exception  with  respect  to 
layoff  proceedings,  it  is  not  anomalous  for  the  Legislature  to  permit  districts  to  lay  off  certain 
employees.  who  have  yet  to  attain  permanent  status  on  the  basis  of  seniority,  and  the  experience 
it  implies,  regardless  of  whether  the  credential  is  provisional,  preliminary,  or  clear. 

13. 

Respondents  Beyer,  Eisenbise,  Paulson,  and  Robertson,  who  hold  emergency 
permits,  are  therefore  probationary  employees  entitled  to  the  protection  of  sections  44949  and 
44955,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  18  through  31  and  legal  conclusion  numbers  6,  9, 
10,  11,  and  12.  Similarly,  Respondents  Cavasoz,  Cooper,  Cushman,  Guevara,  Lynch,  Swanson, 
and  Whittington,  were  improperly  classified  as  temporary  employees  during  a  portion  of  their 
employment  with  the  District. 

14.  |  Respondents  Cavasoz,  Cooper,  Cushman,  Guevara,  Swanson,  and  Whittington, 
who  are  presently  recognized  by  the  District  as  probationary  employees,  are  entitled  to  receive 
credit  as  for  service  as  probationary  employees,  for  the  purpose  of  layoff  seniority,  for  time 
served  under  the  incorrect  classification,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  18  through  31 
and  legal  conclusion  numbers  6,  9,  10,  11,  and  12.  Proper  classification  requires  recalculation 
of  these  Respondents’  seniority  dates.  Giving  them  credit  for  probationary  service  under  waiver 
or  emergency  permits  results  in  the  following  new  seniority  dates:  Cooper  (September  1,  1999); 
Cushman  (January  4,  1999);  and  Swanson  (September  1,  2000).  Respondent  Swanson  did  not 

15

receive  credit  for  one  year  worked  under  a  pre-intern  credential.° 

15. 

|  Respondents  Cooper,  Cushman,  and  Swanson  are  more  senior  than  Zernickow 
and  Burroughs  Ryan,  teachers  retained  to  perform  services  these  Respondents  are  certificated 
Therefore,  cause  does  not  exist  to  terminate  the  services  of  these 
and  competent  to  render. 
Respondents,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  24,  25,  26,  27,  28,  30,  and  33  and  legal 
conclusion  numbers  6,  9,  10,  11,  12,  13,  and  14. 

16. 

Respondents  Beyer,  Eisenbise,  Paulson,  and  Robertson,  who  were  incorrectly 
classified  as  temporary  employees,  shall  have  their  hire  dates  as  their  seniority  dates,  as  follows: 
Beyer  (August  27,  1997);  Eisenbise  (August  30,  1996);  Paulson  (August  30,  2000);  and 
Robertson  (August  30,  2000).

forth 

As  set 

legal  conclusion  number  5  above,  qualifications  must  be 
considered  along  with  seniority.  Section  44955  generally  refers  to  “qualifications”  in  subsection 
(c),  but  more  specifically  to  “certificated  and  competent”  in  subsection  (b).  In  this  case,  the 
District  did  not  establish  specific  criteria  for  defining  competence  in  a  particular  assignment. 

in 

In  Campbell  Elementary  Teachers  Association,  Inc.  v.  Abbott,  76  Cal.App3d  796,  814- 
15  (1978),  the  court  held  the  district  was  not  required  to  recognize  a  certificate  unless  it  had 
been  recorded  with  the  county  board  of  education  prior  to  March  15",  the  date  the  district  had 
to  issue  preliminary  layoff  notices.  In  this  case,  Respondent  Beyer  did  not  provide  the  District 
with  his  preliminary  credential  prior  to  March  15,  2004.  Likewise,  Respondents  Eisenbise, 
Paulson  and  Robertson,  have  not  established  that  prior  to  March  15,  2004  they  held  a 
credential,  permit  or  authorization  that  would  enable  them  to  teach  during  the  2004-05  school 
year;  on  the  contrary,  their  provisional  credentials  are  subject  to  renewal  on  a  yearly  basis  based 
on  a  demonstration  of  need  by  the  District,  which  need  issues  have  not  been  addressed  by  the 
District  or  CTC  for  the  2004-05  school  year. 

18. 

The  District  has  established  that  it  is  in  the  interest  of  the  District  and  its  pupils 
not  to  lay  off  the  following  individuals  because  they  possess  special  training  and  experience  to 
meet  a  District  need:  Glenda  Bangle;  Ana  Bernal;  Nicole  Bucka;  Dianne  Dunne;  Lani 
Ellington;  Brett  Hall;  Michelle  Klein;  Robert  Mancilla;  Frank  Martinez;  Nancy  Maynard; 
Nathan  Nichols;  Christopher  Pirraglia;  Michelle  Ronga;  and  Catherine  Strother. 

19. 

With  the  exception  of  Respondents  Cooper,  Cushman,  and  Swanson,  no 
certificated  employee  junior  to  any  Respondent  was  retained  to  render  a  service  for  which  the 
Respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

  

°Although  Respondents  Cavasoz,  Guevara,  and  Whittington  have  earlier  hire  dates,  it  was  not  established  at 
the  hearing  that  this  service  was  pursuant  to  an  emergency  or  waiver  permit,  as  opposed  to  intern  or  pre-intern 
credentials.

Cause  exists  to  terminate  the  services  of  Respondents  Babczenko,  Beyer, 
Cavasoz,  Dougherty,  Eisenbise,  Geibel,  Guevara,  Hadan,  Jensen,  Long,  Lynch,  McGhyghy, 
Moore,  Paulson,  Robertson,  Rubio,  Seagle,  Simpson-Harris,  Somerville,  Valenzuela,  and 
Whittington,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  20,  21,  22,  23,  26,  29,  31,  32,  34,  35,  and  36 
and  legal  conclusion  numbers  7,  16,  17,  and  19. 

21. 

Respondents  argue  that  the  District’s  failure  to  properly  classify  its  employees 
has  resulted  in  such  a  flawed  seniority  list  that  the  only  fair  and  equitable  result  is  to  dismiss  the 
Accusations.  Respondents  seek  an  extraordinary  remedy,  namely,  the  invalidation  of  a  layoff 
that  is  otherwise  lawful  because  of  errors  in  ranking  certain  certificated  employees  by  seniority. 
However,  they  have  presented  no  authority  for  such  broad  remedy.  Such  remedy  is  unwarranted 
where,  as  here,  Respondents  have  had  the  opportunity  to  adjust  their  seniority  date  at  the 
hearing  and  to  show  that  less  senior  employees  were  retained  to  perform  services  the  employee 
was  certificated  and  competent  to  render.  The  request  is  therefore  denied.
