BEFORE THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE
CAPISTRANO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

In the Matter of the Accusation Against:

CERTAIN CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES,

OAH Case No. 2011020901

Respondents.

PROPOSED DECISION

Daniel Juárez, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), Office of Administrative Hearings,

heard this matter on April 12, 2011, in San Juan Capistrano, California.

Atkinson, Andelson, Loya, Ruud & Romo, and Anthony P. De Marco, Esq.,

represented the Capistrano Unified School District (CUSD).

Reich, Adell, Crost & Cvitan, and Marianne Reinhold, Esq., represented

Respondents. Those Respondents are listed in Appendix A.

The Administrative Law Judge held the record open until April 29, 2011, to allow

each party to submit written closing briefs on designated days. The parties submitted closing
briefs timely; the briefs were marked for identification.

As the final brief was filed early, the parties submitted the matter for decision on

April 28, 2011.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

2.

Joseph M. Farley, Ed.D, CUSD Superintendent, filed the Accusations in his

official capacity. CUSD served the Accusations on all Respondents timely.

CUSD employs Respondents as temporary certificated employees. Many

though not all Respondents are certificated employees who had previously achieved
permanent or probationary status with CUSD and whom CUSD laid off during the 2010,
2009, and/or 2008 school years. However, for the 2010-2011 school year, CUSD employed
Respondents only as temporary employees.

3.

CUSD offered an exemplar of the temporary employment contracts agreed to

between Respondents and CUSD. The contract in evidence specifies a beginning date of
September 7, 2010, and an end date of June 23, 2011. The contracts contain the signatures of
CUSD’s Assistant Superintendent of Personnel Services and each Respondent. Respondents

1

did not object to the accuracy or authenticity of the exemplar in evidence or of the exemplar
nature of the document.

4.

When CUSD initially provided Respondents with their temporary contracts,
CUSD erroneously defined all of the contracts as being pursuant to Education Code section
44909, when in fact, some of the Respondents issued temporary contracts were temporary
employees pursuant to other Education Code sections. Education Code section 44909
pertains to categorically funded positions. It was unclear whether any of the evidence
accurately distinguished the statutory authority for the temporary contracts.

5.

All of the contracts were entitled, “Offer of Temporary Employment” and

contained additional wording offering temporary employment to Respondents.

6.

On February 22, 2011, pursuant to Resolution 1011-391, the CUSD Board of
Trustees (Board) determined to reduce and/or discontinue certain services within the school
district due to the financial constraints resulting from insufficient revenue. Resolution 1011-
39 proposed a reduction of 346 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. The Board determined
that, at the end of the 2010-2011 school year, because of the reduction of particular kinds of
services, it was necessary to terminate its temporary employees, including those temporary
employees in categorically funded positions, equal in number to the positions affected.2 The
Board directed CUSD’s administration to notify all temporary certificated employees of the
Board’s determinations and to inform these employees that if they claimed to be
probationary or permanent certificated employees, the notices would also serve to notify
them that their services would not be required for the 2011-2012 school year.

1 The Board adopted Resolution 1011-39 on February 22, 2011.

2 Resolution 1011-39 resolves to reduce or eliminate 346 FTE positions; however,

CUSD issued 348 notices to 348 temporary employees. CUSD seeks to terminate the
employment of all 348 employees. The names of all 348 individuals are listed in Exhibit 6;
Exhibit 6 was admitted into the record at hearing. This disparity (346 FTE positions
identified in the resolution, and 348 temporary employees noticed) is of no moment, as the
recipients of the notices, all 348, are temporary employees who may be released as provided
for in their temporary employment contracts, as determined in the Legal Conclusions, post.
Further, Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b) allows a governing board to
“terminate the services of not more than a corresponding percentage of the certificated
employees of the district, permanent as well as probationary, at the close of the school year.”
(Italics added.) Thus, while the Legislature intends for these proceedings to be limited in
scope by the number of particular kinds of services the governing boards resolve to reduce or
eliminate, that limitation in Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b) saliently relates
solely to permanent and probationary certificated employees, not temporary employees. As
such, nothing, including Resolution 1011-39, prohibits CUSD from releasing all 348
temporary employees it served with the Accusation.

2

7.

Pursuant to Resolution 1011-39, on approximately February 23, 2011, the

Assistant Superintendent of Personnel Services, Jodee Brentlinger, notified Respondents, in
writing, that Respondents’ services would not be required for the 2011-2012 school year.
The written notice stated the reasons for termination and informed each Respondent, that
while CUSD believed each Respondent was a temporary employee that could be released,
pursuant to Education Code section 44954, CUSD understood that under certain limited
circumstances, temporary certificated employees associated with categorical programs were
entitled to participate in layoff proceedings applicable to probationary and permanent
employees. For this reason, Brentlinger extended each Respondent the right to a hearing in
its written notice, although she emphasized that CUSD was not converting their temporary
employment positions into permanent or probationary positions by virtue of extending them
the right to a certificated layoff hearing.

8.

Brentlinger issued two versions of notices. Brentlinger sent the first version of

notice to temporary employees who were currently on a 39-month or 24-month
reemployment list due to the 2009 or 2010 layoff proceedings. In this first version of notice,
Brentlinger further informed Respondents that the instant proceeding would not and could
not affect their prior layoff status and that their intended release from temporary employment
would not negatively impact their rights to be rehired consistent with their established
seniority date as former permanent or probationary employees.

9.

Brentlinger sent the second version of notice to all other temporary employees,

those who were not currently on a 39-month or 24-month reemployment list as a
consequence of an earlier layoff. This second version contained all of the information noted
in Factual Finding 7, but did not contain the information delineated in Factual Finding 8.

10.

Approximately 164 temporary employees requested administrative hearings to

determine if there was cause for not reemploying them for the 2011-2012 school year.
Respondents whom CUSD served with Accusations are listed in Appendix B.

11.

The recommendation that Respondents be terminated from employment was

not related to their performance as teachers.

12.

The services at issue are “particular kinds of services” that could be reduced or
discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955. The Board’s decision to
reduce or discontinue these particular kinds of services was not arbitrary or capricious, but
constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

13.

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related to the

welfare of CUSD and its pupils. The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of CUSD, as
determined by the Board.

3

14.

The Board considered all known attrition, resignations, and retirements, at the
time, in determining the actual number of necessary termination notices to be delivered to its
employees.

15.

Respondents did not testify at hearing; they offered no evidence otherwise.3

Respondents instead chose to proffer solely legal arguments on their behalves. Respondents’
legal arguments are described in Legal Conclusion 9.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

CUSD met all notice and jurisdictional requirements set forth in Education

Code sections 44944 and 44945. Respondents requested hearings timely.

2.

The services identified in Resolution 1011-39 are particular kinds of services
that the Board can reduce or discontinue under Education Code section 44955. The Board’s
decision to reduce or discontinue the identified services was not arbitrary or capricious, and
was a proper exercise of its discretion. Cause for the reduction or discontinuation of services
relates solely to the welfare of CUSD’s schools and pupils within the meaning of Education
Code section 44949. CUSD identified the temporary certificated employees that the Board
directed to be released.

3.

A school district may reduce services within the meaning of Education Code

section 44955, subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to
students shall not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by
determining that proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are
made available to deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 167, 178-179.)

4.

Education Code section 44954 provides that governing boards of school

districts may release certificated temporary employees “at the pleasure of the board prior to
serving during one school year at least 75 percent of the number of days the regular schools
of the district are maintained” or after serving during one school year at least 75 percent of
the number of days the regular schools of the district are maintained “if the employee is
notified before the end of the school year of the district’s decision not to reelect the employee
for the next succeeding year.”

5.

The courts have held that categorically funded teachers may be treated like
temporary employees. (Zalac v. Ferndale Unified School District, (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th

3 At hearing, Respondents sought to present testimony of certain Respondents

regarding solely whether they properly possess rights to reemployment with CUSD. (See
Educ. Code §§ 44956 & 44957.) The ALJ granted CUSD’s motion in limine to exclude this
testimony on the basis that the issue of reemployment rights is not pertinent to a reduction in
force hearing, pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. (See Legal
Conclusion 8.)

4

838, 840-841 [A kindergarten teacher’s first two years of employment was as a temporary
employee in a categorically funded program pursuant to Education Code section 44909].) In
Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v. Bakersfield City School District (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 1260, the Court of Appeal found that teachers in categorical funded positions
“are treated in much the same way [as temporary employees] in that they may be dismissed
without the formalities required for probationary and permanent employees in the event the
program expires or is terminated, and their service does not count toward acquiring
permanent status (unless they are reemployed the following year in a probationary position).”
(Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v. Bakersfield City School District, supra, 145
Cal.App.4th at 1286; see Legal Conclusion 7 for the pertinent wording of Education Code
section 44909.)

6.

As long as the minimal requirements of Education Code section 44954 are

met, CUSD may release its certificated temporary employees. The evidence established that
Respondents’ circumstances meet those requirements. There was no evidence that any
Respondents were anything but temporary employees, or those who could be treated as
temporary employees (those in categorically funded positions), pursuant to contracts with
CUSD. CUSD may release Respondents in the manner allowed by law for temporary
employees. (Educ. Code, § 44954; see also Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v.
Bakersfield City School District, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at 1273, citing Educ. Code, § 44954
& Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma County Union High School District (2003) 29 Cal.4th 911,
917-918.)

7(a). Education Code section 44909 pertains to categorically funded positions.

7(b). Education Code section 44909 provides that the governing board of any school

district “may employ persons possessing an appropriate credential as certificated employees
in programs and projects to perform services conducted under contract with public or private
agencies, or categorically funded projects which are not required by federal or state statutes.
The terms and conditions under which such persons are employed shall be mutually agreed
upon by the employee and the governing board and such agreement shall be reduced to
writing.”

7(c). The Legislature further provided that persons employed pursuant to Education
Code section 44909, “may be employed for periods which are less than a full school year and
may be terminated at the expiration of the contract or specially funded project without regard
to other requirements of this [Education] code respecting the termination of probationary or
permanent employees.”

7(d). Of pertinence to Respondents’ arguments, as delineated post, Education Code

section 44909 further states, “[t]his section shall not be construed to apply to any regularly
credentialed employee who has been employed in the regular educational programs of the
school district as a probationary employee before being subsequently assigned to any one of
these programs.”

5

8.

Respondents’ legal arguments involved matters pertaining to the

administration of categorical programs or their rights to reemployment. As set forth in
Factual Finding 15, note 3, the issue of their right to reemployment is not an issue to be
determined within this proceeding. As CUSD correctly argued, the purpose of this
proceeding is “to determine if there is cause for not reemploying him or her [certificated
employees] for the ensuing year,” and the ALJ makes a “determination as to the sufficiency
of the cause.” (Educ. Code, § 44949, subds. (b) & (c)(3).) Except as necessary for a
determination of whether cause exists for not reemploying them for the 2011-2012 school
year, nothing in Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 provide for the determination of a
respondent employee’s status within this proceeding. Such determinations are outside of the
jurisdiction of this proceeding.

9(a). Respondents’ legal arguments are summarized as follows. First, that by

employing Respondents as temporary employees, CUSD cannot convert Respondents who
already achieved permanent and probationary status into temporary employees, pursuant to
their interpretation of Education Code section 44909. Respondents specifically argued that
the statutory language set forth in Legal Conclusion 7(d) specifically precludes Respondents
who already achieved permanent and probationary status from temporary employment in
categorically funded positions.

9(b). Second, CUSD has improperly identified various funding sources as
categorical funding. Specifically, Respondents pointed to the use of state lottery funding,
and special education funding that they assert cannot be categorical, due to the on-going
nature of those funds. Respondents rely on Zalac v. Governing Board of Ferndale Unified
School District, supra, 98 Cal.App. 838.

9(c). Third, CUSD has improperly used smaller categorical funds by placing or

“sweeping” those funds into a general fund account. As such, CUSD should not use these
“swept’ funds to support a temporary employment contract.

9(d). Fourth, CUSD improperly offered and classified Respondents as temporary

employees, pursuant to Education Code section 44920, when using partnership (job sharing)
positions.

9(e). Respondents contend that due to CUSD’s improper actions, as set forth
immediately above, CUSD has wrongly employed Respondents as, and effectively converted
Respondents into, temporary employees. Respondents further contend that a significant
consequence of temporary employment is that, upon release, their reemployment rights are
not extended as they would be if CUSD had laid off Respondents as permanent or
probationary employees. (See Educ. Code, §§ 44956 & 44957.) That is, if CUSD had
employed Respondents as permanent or probationary employees for the current school year,
and then laid them off pursuant to a certificated layoff proceeding, the Education Code
would extend their rights to reemployment by another 39 or 24 months, depending on
whether they were permanent or probationary employees. (Ibid.) Respondents argue, as
they are temporary employees, despite many of them having previously achieved permanent

6

or probationary status with CUSD, their release improperly affords them no such protection
to an extended reemployment period.

10.

CUSD argued that Respondents’ arguments fall outside the jurisdiction of this

proceeding, but nonetheless proffered written arguments in opposition to Respondents’
arguments, in case the ALJ determined to the contrary. In light of the conclusion that the
ALJ lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate issues regarding the operation of the categorical
programs or Respondents’ reemployment rights, neither CUSD’s nor Respondents’
arguments are addressed further.

11.

Nonetheless, the ALJ cautions CUSD to consider the First District Court of

Appeal’s analysis in California Teachers Association v. Vallejo City School District (2007)
149 Cal.App.4th 135, where in discussing the Vallejo City School District’s use of temporary
employees, it said, “[i]n establishing these narrow categories [of temporary employment], the
Legislature has sought to limit the ability of school districts to classify teachers as temporary
employees.” (California Teachers Association v. Vallejo City School District, supra, 149
Cal.App.4th at 146 [citing Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association, supra, 145
Cal.App.4th at 1280].) Of particular pertinence here, quoting Haase v. San Diego
Community College District (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 913, 918, the Vallejo Court wrote: “The
Legislature . . . has restricted the flexibility of a school district in the continued use of
temporary employees [citations], for otherwise the benefits resulting from employment
security for teachers could be subordinated to the administrative needs of a district.”
(California Teachers Association v. Vallejo City School District, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at
146.) Quoting Balen v. Peralta Junior College District (1974) 11 Cal.3d 821, 826, the
Vallejo Court further wrote, “[b]ecause the substitute and temporary classifications are not
guaranteed procedural due process by statute, they are narrowly defined by the Legislature,
and should be strictly interpreted.” (California Teachers Association v. Vallejo City School
District, supra, at 146-147.) It is noted that the Vallejo Court concluded that temporary
classifications should be strictly construed, due to their narrow statutory definitions, when a
certificated employee’s classification is factually unclear. In Vallejo, the school district had
not claimed that the teachers at issue fell into one of the statutorily defined categories of
temporary employment, but instead the Vallejo City School District had employed them
pursuant to a contract of “provisional/emergency employment,” the meaning of which was
unclear in regard to the teachers’ classifications. (Id., at 147.) Thus, the situation here is
distinguishable, where the nature of Respondents temporary employment was clear.

12.

Cause exists to sustain CUSD’s action to release all Respondents for the 2011-

2012 school year, because they are neither permanent nor probationary employees pursuant
to Education Code sections 44955, as set forth in Factual Findings 1-15, and Legal
Conclusions 1-10.

ORDER

The Accusations served on Respondents (those Respondents identified in

Appendix B), are sustained.
