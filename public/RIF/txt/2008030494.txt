2. 

On  or  about  March  10,  2008,  the  superintendent  gave  written  notice  to 

22  employees  that,  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955,  it  was being 
recommended  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or  eliminated  at  the  close  of  the  2007- 
2008  school  year.  Ten  employees  —  Eileen  Coll-Gieg,  Craig  Dauch,  Natasha  Flint-Moore, 
Maranda  Hanson,  Andrew  Jackman,  Michael  Lindberg,  Sandra  Medlin,  Wilbert  Perry, 
Christina  Petersen,  and  Sandra  Wade  ~ filed  timely  requests  for  hearing  and  were  then 
served  with  accusation  packets.  The  district  subsequently  withdrew  the  notices  sent  to 
Eileen  Coll-Gieg  and  Maranda  Hanson,  leaving  eight  respondents  in  this  proceeding. 

3. 

The  reductions  have  been  recommended  based  upon  a variety  of  budgetary 

considerations:  there  is  a  declining  enrollment  at  the  elementary  level;  there  is  some 
overstaffing  at  the  secondary  level;  there  are  some  secondary  classes  with  very  low 
enrollment;  there  is  overstaffing  in  the  elementary  prep  program  (teachers  covering  classes 
during  classroom  teachers’  prep  periods);  there  is  an  expected  reduction  in  funding  in  some 
categorical  programs,  which  would  lead  to  greater  encroachment  on  the  general  fund  since 
even  at  the  present  level  the  categorical  funds  reccived  do  not  always  cover  the  full  costs  of 
the  programs;  and.a 
school  currently  on  a  four-track  year-round  program  is  being  converted 
to  a  single-track  program.  The  reductions  are  in  the  interest  of  the  schools  and  their  students.

No junior  employee  is  being  retained  to  render a  service  that  any  of  the 

respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  provide.

5. 

Wilbert  Perry  is  a  1.0  FTE  Industrial  Technology  teacher  at  Vanden  High 
School.  He  teaches  the  0.2  FTE  Cisco  Academy  course  that  is  being  eliminated.  (At  the 
secondary  level,  each  class  equals  0.2  FTE.)  Perry  maintains  this  course  should  not  be 
eliminated  because  it  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  prepare  students  for  certification  in 
a  very  lucrative  field.  Vanden  is  the  only  high  school  in  the  area  that  offers  this  course. 
When  the  district  began  the  program  seven  years  ago,  it  paid  to  have  Perry  trained  to  teach 
the  program  and  it  made  an  investment  in  computer  hardware.  Just  last  year,  $30,000  was 
spent  to  upgrade  the  hardware  used  in  the  program.  Perry  contends  it  is  not  in  the  interest 
of  the  students  to  discontinue  the  Cisco  Academy  course. 

While  Perry’s  concerns  are  recognized,  district  governing  boards  are  given 
wide  discretion  in  managing  their  budgets  and  determining  what  courses  to  offer.  While 
climination  of  the  Cisco  Academy  course  may  well  have  a  negative  impact  on  some  students, 
when  viewed  in  the  broad  picture  of  budgetary  concerns  (this  is  one  of  the  courses  with  very 
low  enrollment),  it  cannot  be  found  that  the  board  abused  its  discretion  in  recommending  this 
reduction. 

6. 

Respondents  assert  that,  by  its  terms,  Resolution  No.  2007-08-28  does  not 
authorize  the  termination  of  employees  until  the  end  of  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The 
resolution  provides,  in  part: 

WHEREAS,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Travis  Unified  School 
District  has  determined  that  it  shall  be  necessary  to  decrease  the 
following  programs  of  the  District  no  later  than  the  beginning  of 
the  2008-2009  school  year;  and 

WHEREAS,  it  shall  be  necessary  to  terminate  at  the  end of  the 
2008-2009  school  year  the  employment  of  certain  certificated 
employees  of  the  District  as  a  result  of the  elimination  of  the 
programs;  ... 

(] 

THEREFORE,  BE  IT  RESOLVED  by  the  Governing  Board  of 
the  Travis  Unified  School  District  that  the  following  services 
shall  be  reduced  or  eliminated  no  later  than  the  beginning of  the 
2008-2009  school  year.... 

Viewed  in  the  context of  the  entire  resolution.  the  reference  in  the  second 
“whereas”  paragraph  to  the  2008-2009  school  year  is  clearly  a  typographical  error.  The 
reference  should  have  been  to  the  2007-2008  school  year.  Respondents’  assertion  is  without 
merit.

Any  other  contentions  made  by  respondents  at  the  hearing  that  were  not

discussed  above  are  found  to  be  without  merit.

Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  Cause  further  exists  to  give  respondents  notice  that,  to  the 
extent  shown  in  the  layoff  notices  sent  them,  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008- 
2009  school  year.  This  cause  relates  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof 
within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949, 

ORDER 

Notice  may  be  given  respondents  that,  to  the  extent  shown  in  the  layoff  notices  sent 

them,  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.
