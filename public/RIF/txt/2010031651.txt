All prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met. 

 
 
On  February  9,  2010,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  (Governing  Board) 
adopted Resolution number 2010-14, reducing 10 full-time-equivalent positions in Kindergarten 
through Sixth Grade classroom services for the 2010-2011 school year. 
 
 
Superintendent  Silberberg  thereafter  provided  written  notice  to  the  Governing 
Board that he recommended the termination of Respondents’ services for the 2010-2011 school 
year due to the reduction of particular kinds of services.  
 
 
On  March  10,  2010,  the  District  provided  notice  to  Respondents  that  their 
services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2010-2011  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of  particular 
kinds of services. Respondents filed timely requests for hearing.  
 
 
On  March  26,  2010,  the  District  filed  and  served  the  Accusation  and  other 
required  documents  on  Respondents.  Respondents  thereafter  timely  filed  a  Notice  of  Defense, 
seeking  a  determination  of  whether  cause  exists  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  2010-2011 
school year.  
 
 
 
 
which may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.  
 
 
The  Governing  Board  took  action  to  reduce  the  services  set  forth  in  factual 
finding  number  3  primarily  because  of  anticipated  declines  in  State  funding.  The  decision  to 
reduce  or  discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious  but  is 
rather a proper exercise of the District's discretion. 
 
The reduction of services set forth in factual finding number 3, in the context of 
 
reductions necessitated by the anticipated cuts in State funding, is related to the welfare of the 
District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated 
employees as determined by the Governing Board. 
 
 
11.  On February 9, 2010, the Governing Board adopted Resolution 2010-15, setting 
forth its tie-breaking criteria for employees with the same seniority date. Points were awarded for 
meeting  one  or  more  of  the  following  criteria:  credentialing;  experience;  extracurricular 
activities; special education credential; evaluations; CLAD certificate; BCLAD certificate; units 
earned beyond a Bachelor’s Degree; earned degree beyond a Bachelor’s degree. The criteria are 
reasonable as they relate to the skills and qualifications of certificated employees.  
 
 
Respondent  Wonderly  challenged  the  seniority  date  assigned  to  two  retained 
teachers, Lindsay Atchley (Atchley) and Michelle Turner (Turner), June 14, 2007 and June 7, 

The services set forth in factual finding number 3 are particular kinds of services

2007, respectively. Respondent Wonderly’s first date of paid service is June 26, 2007.  
 
The District has a practice of allowing certificated employees to start work during 
the Summer to prepare the curriculum they will use with students. Teachers are paid when they 
work on curriculum preparation, although the rate was not established at the hearing. Atchley, 
Turner,  and  Respondent  Wonderly  performed  curriculum  work  in  the  Summer  of  2007, 
pertaining to their elementary school teaching assignment. 
 
The  collective  bargaining  agreement  between  the  District  and  the  certificated 
 
employees’ representative, the Standard Teachers Association (STA), provides for 183 days of 
duty  for  returning  teachers  and  for  185  days  of  duty  for  teachers  in  their  first  year  of 
employment. Paula Woodard, STA President, testified without contradiction that the District has 
not consulted or bargained about extending the additional duty period for new teachers beyond 
the two days in the collective bargaining agreement.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Jurisdiction for the subject proceeding exists pursuant to Education Code sections 

 
 
44949 and 44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 7. 
 
 
The  services  listed  in  factual  finding  number  3  are  particular  kinds  of  services 
within the meaning of Education Code section 44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 3 
and 8.   
 
 
Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the reduction of 
the particular kinds of services set forth in factual finding number 3, which cause relates solely to 
the welfare of the District's schools and pupils, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 
14.  
 
The seniority date of a certificated employee is defined as the date the employee 
 
“first rendered paid service in a probationary capacity.” (§ 44845.)  These words must be given 
their  plain  and  commonsense  meaning  in  order  to  effectuate  the  legislative  intent.  (Hughes  v. 
Board of Architectural Examiners (1998) 17 Cal.4th 763, 775; California Teachers Assn. v. 
Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School District (1997) 14 Cal.4th 627, 632-633; Steketee v. 
Lintz,  Williams  &  Rothberg  (1985)  38  Cal.3d  46,  51-52.)    The  statute  requires  crediting  a 
certificated  employee  with  the  seniority  date  on  which  he  or  she  was  first  paid  to  render 
service in a probationary capacity. The statute does not expressly require a particular salary rate 
or  schedule,  a  particular  type  of  service  in  a  probationary  capacity,  or  that  the  service  be 
“mandatory,” in order for the paid service to be credited for seniority purposes. 
 
 
Atchley,  Turner,  and  Respondent  Wonderly  were  hired  to  render  services  in  a 
probationary capacity and the curriculum work they performed, for which they were paid, was 
part  of  the  teaching  services  they  were  hired  to  perform.  Respondent  Wonderly  nevertheless

argues that all teachers should be limited to the two days of additional seniority permitted by the 
collective bargaining agreement as days of duty. However, this limitation is not evident from the 
plain language of the statute. Nor did Respondent Wonderly present any authority or persuasive 
argument  for  such  statutory  construction.  Accordingly,  the  construction  suggested  by 
Respondent Wonderly would impermissibly modify the plain language of the statute and will not 
be  accepted.    Moreover,  to  the  extent  that  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  can  be  read  to 
modify the statute, it must yield. 
 
 
perform a service Respondents are competent and certificated to render. 
 
 
Cause exists to terminate the services of Respondents Taylor and Wonderly for 
the  2010-2011  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services,  by  reason  of 
factual finding numbers 1 through 14 and legal conclusion numbers 1 through 5.  
 

The  District  did  not  retain  any  certificated  employee  junior  to  Respondents  to

ORDER 

 
The  Accusations  are  sustained  and  the  District  may  notify  Respondents  Taylor  and 
 
Wonderly  that  their  services  will  not  be  needed  during  the  2010-2011  school  year  due  to  the 
reduction of particular kinds of services.
