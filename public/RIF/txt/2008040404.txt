FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

The  matter  was  submitted  on  May  5,  2008. 

Respondent  is  a  certificated  employee  of  the  district. 

Superintendent  of  the  Mojave  Unified  School  District. 

Larry  Phelps  made  and  filed  the  accusation  in  his  official  capacity  as 

On  March  11,  2008,  the  district’s  governing  board  adopted  Resolution  No. 

031108-2  reducing  particular  kinds  of  services  and  directing  the  superintendent  to  give 
appropriate  notices  to  certificated  employees  whose  positions  will  be  affected  by  the  action 
(PKS  resolution).

An  accusation  was  served  on  respondent.  Although  it  appears  that  respondent 

did  not  file  a  notice  of  defense,  he  was  granted  a  hearing.  All prehearing jurisdictional 
requirements  have  been  met. 

e 

In  its  PKS  resolution,  the  governing  board  took  action  to  reduce  the  following 

particular  kinds  of  service  for  the  2008-2009  school year: 

Particular  Kinds  of  Service 

  

FTE 

K-7  Elementary  Regular  Classroom 
Teaching  Positions  (Self-Contained) 

Continuation  School  Teaching  Positions 

Woods  Teaching  Position 

Director  of  Educational  Services  Position 

Vice  Principal  Positions 

Teachers  on  Special  Assignment  Positions 

Instructional  Technology  Specialist  Position

9. 

The  total  reduction  of  certificated  FTE  positions  in  the  PKS  resolution  is  14. 

Respondent  is  the  least  senior  employee  in  the  district.  His  first paid  date  of 

service  to  the  district  is  January  29,  2008. 

10. 

Respondent  contends  that  he  should  not  be  laid  off  when  the  district  is 

retaining  teachers  who  are  not  as  experienced,  as  well-trained,  or  as  well-credentialed  as  he 
is.  Before he  joined  the  district,  respondent  taught  for  eight  years  in  the  Palmdale  School 
District.  He  participated  in  the  BTSA  program  (Beginning  Teacher  Support  and  Assessment 
Project)  as  early  as  2000,  and  he  possesses  a  Clear  Multiple  Subject  Teaching  Credential, 
which  he  has  held  since  2003. 

Respondent’s  accomplishments  are  not  questioned.  However,  when a  district 
proposes  to  lay off certificated  employees  due  to  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  service, 
state  law  requires  (with  certain  exceptions  not  relevant  here)  that  the  employees  must  be 

  

 

  

terminated  in  the  inverse of  the  order  in  which  they  were  employed  by  the  district.  (Ed. 
Code,  §  44955,  subd.  (c).) 

11. 

No  permanent  or  probationary  employee  with  less  seniority  is  being  retained 

to  render  a  service  which  respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

Cause  for  the  elimination  of  14  FTE  exists  in  accordance  with  Education  Code 
sections  44949  and  44955.  Cause  further  exists  to  give  respondent  notice  that  his  services 
will  be  eliminated  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  This  cause  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of 
the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949. 

ORDER 

The  district  may  give  notice  to  respondent  Donald  Deputy  that  his  services  will  not  be 

required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.
