because it was necessary to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services.1 
 
 
Report Number 204-10/11 (Resolution), to reduce and discontinue particular kinds of 
services no later than the end of the 2010-2011 school year and to lay off a number of 
certificated permanent employees due to the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of 
services.  The Board authorized the District’s Human Resources Division to send notices to 
certificated permanent employees informing them that they would be laid off by June 30, 
2011, in accordance with Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.

was cause for not reemploying them for the 2011-2012 school year.2  The District served 
2974 of these individuals with Notices of Hearing on April 8, 2011, and served one of these 
individuals, Karina Pena (#739677), with a Notice of Hearing on April 18, 2011.  It was not 
established that this seven-day notice to Respondent Pena constituted a prejudicial error.3

known attrition in determining the number of layoff notices to be served on its employees.  
The District continued to consider positively assured attrition through March 15, and has 
continued to consider attrition occurring thereafter.7 
 
The decision to reduce the particular kinds of services was based on a fiscal 
 
solvency problem related to the current state budget crisis, due to which the District has an 
operating deficit in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  The Board has determined to reduce 
its budget next year, in part by reducing particular kinds of services.8

7  In a layoff proceeding like this, a governing board need only consider positively 
assured attrition that occurs prior to the March 15th layoff notice deadline, not thereafter.  
(San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 635.)   
 
8 This Factual Finding was established through stipulation of counsel.  Several weeks 
 
into the evidentiary hearing, Respondent’s counsel sought to withdraw this stipulation and to 
present contrary evidence, noting that the news outlets had reported that additional, recently 
discovered monies were available to the State which could be used to fund education.  
However, the ALJ denied the request to present such evidence because:  (1) there was no 
evidence that any of the discovered funds had been made available to the District yet, (2) the 
focus of this evidentiary proceeding is the propriety of the Resolution at the time it was 
adopted, and (3) any monies later provided to the District could affect rehiring, but do not 
impact the necessity of the Resolution, which is, in part, the subject of this layoff proceeding.

17(a).  The District currently employs 550 nurses.  Of that number, 92 permanent 

17(b).  Currently, every school site has nursing assistance.  However, a nurse is not 

Nursing -  Meeting Mandated Levels 
 
 
nurses and 26 non-permanent nurses (totaling 118) are subject to layoff.  Respondents argue 
that the District may not lay off nurses and continue to provide mandated State services.  
This argument was not persuasive.    
 
 
present at every school site on every school day; typically, a nurse will be at each school site 
for at least one day of the week.  This has been the norm for the past three years.   
 
 
17(c).  There are certain health screening requirements mandated by the State.  
Hearing testing is required for every student (Ed. Code, § 49452); vision appraisal is required 
upon enrollment and at least every three years thereafter until eighth grade (Ed. Code, §§ 
49452 and 49455); and scoliosis screening is required for seventh grade females and eighth 
grade males (Ed. Code, § 49452.5).  The District employs about 20 audiometrists who 
currently conduct the hearing screening, as authorized by statute.  (Ed. Code, § 49454.)   
Although nurses currently conduct vision screening, this can be done by other trained and 
authorized personnel.  (Ed. Code, § 49452.)  Scoliosis screening is conducted by nurses, but 
that screening occurs only once in a pupil’s enrollment in the District.  Additionally, scoliosis 
screenings may be conducted by physicians, by an outside contracted agency, or by other 
trained personnel supervised by a nurse, a physician or by an outside contracted agency.  (Ed. 
Code, § 49452.5.)      
 
 
administration of medication.  (Ed. Code, § 49423.)  Additionally, the District employs other 
health care professionals, such as 400 health care assistants who, under the supervision of 
nurses or physicians, can provide a number of interventions such as catheterization, gastric 
tube feeding, suctioning and other services that require medically-related training.  (Ed. Code 
§ 44923.5.)  Furthermore, the five physicians currently employed by the District may serve 
in a variety of roles including supervision of practitioners and other health care assistants.    
 
 
services after the reduction in the number of nurses.  The provisions creating mandates for 
health services (e.g., Ed. Code, §§ 49452 (sight and hearing assessments); 49455 (vision 
appraisal on enrollment and every third year until eight grade); and 49452.5 (scoliosis 
screening for seventh grade girls and eighth grade boys) do not require that the mandated 
services be provided exclusively by certificated nurses, and Respondents have not cited any 
provision of law that mandates employment of nurses for these services.  Additionally, 
Respondents have not shown that the delegation of duties would result in services falling 
below the mandated levels.  Services will continue to be provided by authorized individuals, 
some under the supervision of a nurse.  The hearing screening is already being conducted by 
audiometrists, and Respondents’ nurse representative admitted that many of the other 
mandated services can be provided by trained personnel or personnel with other health 
certifications, albeit under the supervision of a nurse or physician.  There was no evidence 

17(d).  Nurses perform other duties which other staff members also perform, such as 

17(e).  The District established that it will be able to provide all of the mandated 

7 

18(a).  The CBA defines an employee’s seniority date as “the employee’s initial 

that the supervision of these authorized personnel would be inadequate following the 
reduction in nurses.  Accordingly, the District has established that it will provide mandated 
health services for the 2011-2012 school year, and that such services will not fall below 
mandated levels.   
 
The Seniority List 
 
 
probationary service date,” which in turn is defined as “the actual beginning of the 
probationary assignment and not any date of a substitute or temporary assignment which was 
later deemed to be probationary service for purposes of acquiring permanent status.”  
However, the District’s permanent employees are laid off based on their “RIF” seniority 
dates, which the District defines as the employees’ first date of service under a contract of 
employment.9  In an effort to comply with Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v. 
Bakersfield City School District (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1260, the District determines RIF 
seniority dates by giving credit to employees who previously served under “provisional” 
contracts so that they receive credit for all time served under contracts of employment.   
 
 
District used RIF seniority dates.  The District’s Seniority List contains certificated 
employees’ names, employee numbers, RIF seniority dates, current assignments and 
locations, credentials and authorizations, and other pertinent information.  The Seniority List 
was developed using information from the District’s electronic database which contains 
official District personnel records.  Staff for the Human Resources (HR) Division maintains, 
regularly reviews and audits the information in the database.  Last year and this year, the 
District offered employees opportunities to review the information contained in the Seniority 
List and to verify its accuracy.  The District sent rosters to each school site, and the 
principals and/or supervisors reviewed the rosters with certificated employees to have them 
verify or correct the information and sign the roster.  The signed rosters were returned to the 
HR Division.   
 
 
information on the Seniority List is accurate. 
 

19.  With some exceptions noted below (Factual Findings 67, 68, 71 and 72), the 

 18(b).  In developing the Seniority List for layoff of its permanent employees, the 

20. 

The District used the Seniority List to develop a proposed layoff list of the 
least senior employees currently assigned in the various particular kinds of services being 
reduced.  The District also used the Seniority List to determine which employees were 
eligible to “bump” less senior employees assigned to provide services that the senior 
employees were certificated and competent to render.    

9 Because the CBA-defined seniority date would continue to be utilized for other 

                                                 
 
purposes under the CBA (e.g., transfer rights and matrix rights), the District uses the term 
“RIF” seniority date only when referring to the seniority date utilized for reduction in force 
purposes.   
 

8 

 
21(a).  The District determined that nobody less senior than Respondents was being 

21(b).  At the evidentiary hearing, the District admitted that Ramiro Gutierrez 

retained to render services which Respondents are certificated and competent to render.  
 
 
(#710330; RIF seniority date 10/24/06) was not provided with a layoff notice although he 
should have received one as a social studies teacher with low seniority.10  There are other 
Respondents who are social studies teachers more senior to Mr. Gutierrez and who have not 
had their layoff notices rescinded.  The most senior Respondent social studies teacher who 
has not yet had his/her layoff notice rescinded should have his/her notice rescinded.  (See 
also Legal Conclusion 8.) 
 
Tie-Breaking Criterion 

 
22(a).  The Board’s Resolution also established a tie-breaking criterion to determine 
the relative seniority of certificated employees who first rendered paid service on the same 
date.  According to the Resolution, the order of layoff in such situations will be based on the 
employees’ seniority numbers, as determined by Article XI, Section 6.2 of the CBA.   

 
22(b).  Pursuant to the CBA, the last five digits of an employee’s seniority number are 

22(c).  For layoff purposes, the District could have adopted tie-breaking criterion that 

computed by a specified formula utilizing the last four numbers of the employee’s Social 
Security Number.  When comparing employee numbers, the lower employee number is 
deemed to be more senior. 
   
 
differed from that set forth in the CBA.  However, there is no requirement that it do so, 
unlike the situation with seniority dates, where the RIF seniority dates differ from the CBA 
seniority dates in order to comply with Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Assn. v. Bakersfield 
City School District (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1260).  Although other districts may have tie-
breaking criteria which include consideration of the employees’ number of credentials and 
college degrees before a final criterion of a random lottery is used, the District is not required 
to utilize all of these criteria.  Due to the size of the District, there are often ties between 
hundreds of employees, so the numeric formula is used for efficiency, transparency and 
certainty.  Employees know their tiebreaker number at their time of hire, and their relative 
seniority is fixed so they can anticipate their standing in any layoff proceeding.  Given the 
foregoing, the tie breaking criterion, as agreed to in the CBA, was an objective and 

                                                 

10 Mr. Gutierrez was originally issued a layoff notice as an elementary school teacher, 

but the District later discovered that he was actually teaching social studies.  The District 
rescinded Mr. Gutierrez’s layoff notice, but did so erroneously and inadvertently, since he 
remained subject to layoff as a social studies teacher.    

 

9 

23.  Although the last five digits of employees’ seniority numbers were placed on the 

reasonable exercise of the Board’s discretion and is based on the needs of the District and its 
students.11      
   
 
Seniority List, the District did not apply the tie-breaking criterion to resolve ties among 
employees with the same seniority date because such a determination was not necessary to 
determine who was subject to layoff.  It was not established that any Respondent was 
included in this layoff proceeding based on the application of the tie-breaking criterion, and 
the District was not required to apply the tie-breaking criterion prior to the hearing.12      
 
Competency Criteria 
 
 
24(a).  The Board’s Resolution also established a definition of competency for 
purposes of allowing an employee currently assigned in a position subject to layoff to 
“bump” a less senior employee holding another position not subject to layoff.  For bumping 
purposes, an employee was “competent” to render a service if:  
 

the employee possesses an appropriate credential for 2011-2012 
assignment, and 

a. 

 
b. 

has at least one (1) year of full-time-equivalent experience 
within the District within  the preceding five (5) years serving in 
the subject area of the assignment.  For purposes of competency, 
“one (1) year of full-time-equivalent experience” shall mean  
having had an assignment in the subject area for at least 75 % of 
the days during the qualifying school year. 

24(b).  For purposes of calculating the “preceding five (5) years,” the District includes 

 
 
the current school year, since the assignment into which the employee may seek to bump 
would be for the 2011-2012 school year.  By way of stipulations of the parties, at least one 

                                                 
11  Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), provides that the order of 
 
termination (i.e. tie-breaking criteria) must be determined “solely on the basis of needs of the 
District and the students thereof.” 
  

12  Appellate courts have not required school districts to apply tie-breaking criteria 

prior to issuing layoff notices.  (Zalac v. Ferndale Unified School District (2002) 98 
Cal.App.4th 838, 855.)  One court approved the process of applying the tie-breaking criteria 
during the hearing when doing so became necessary.  (Bledsoe v. Biggs Unified School 
District (2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 127, 143-44.)   

 

10 

25. 

The District’s five-year recency requirement is deemed reasonable, and the 

employee has qualified to bump into a position for the 2011-2012 school year based on her 
serving in the subject area of the assignment during the current school year.13   
 
 
inclusion of the current school year in the five-year recency requirement is also deemed 
reasonable.  Therefore, the District’s definition of competency in determining bumping rights  
(i.e. whether Respondents who received layoff notices may exercise their statutory right to 
bump into a position held by a less senior employee not subject to layoff) is upheld.14

13 Kimberly Balala (#773219), assigned as a library media teacher, fulfilled the five-
year recency criterion to bump into a social studies position by virtue of the single period of 
social studies she is currently teaching.   

 
14 If a permanent teacher is “certificated and competent” to render a service provided 
by a more junior employee, the senior teacher is statutorily entitled to bump into the junior 
employee’s position and cannot be laid off.  (Ed. Code, § 44955, subd. (b).)  A school district 
has the authority and the discretion to establish competency criteria that relate to the skills 
and qualifications of a teacher for purposes of determining bumping rights.  (Duax v. Kern 
Community College District (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 555, 563-567.)  This discretion is 
limited only by a reasonableness standard (i.e. the district’s criteria must be reasonable, and 
not fraudulent, arbitrary or capricious).  (Campbell Elementary Teachers Association v. 
Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 808.)   Moreover, courts have held that this 
reasonableness standard permits “a difference of opinion on the same subject.”  (Id.)  A 
district’s competency criteria may include a recency requirement.  (Duax, supra, 196 
Cal.App.3d at 567 (approving a recency requirement of “one year of teaching in the last 
ten”).)  Additionally, a court has suggested, without directly addressing the point, that a 
recency requirement of one year experience within the past five years is a valid criterion for 
determining a teacher’s competency.  (Bledsoe v. Biggs Unified School District (2008) 170 
Cal.App.4th 127.)

26(a).  The Board’s Resolution also determined that it was necessary to retain the 

The Superior Court Judgment in Reed v. State of California – Skipping Reed Teachers  
 
 
services of certain classroom teachers at 45 specified schools for the 2011-2012 school year, 
regardless of seniority (also known as skipping), “pursuant to judicial orders issued in the 
matter of Sharail Reed, et al. v. State of California.”   
 
 
 

26(b).  The Resolution required:   

RIF notices that would have been sent to skipped teachers at [the 45 
specified schools] shall be redirected to teachers based on District 
seniority order at schools that would have otherwise received less than 
the district-wide average (by percentage) of RIF notices, but in no case 
shall redirected RIF notices cause a school to exceed  the district-wide 
average of RIF notices, per Court-approved terms in the Reed case.   

27.  On February 8, 2011, Judge William F. Highberger of the Superior Court of 

 
 
the State of California, County of Los Angeles, in Case Number BC 432420, issued a 
Judgment approving the terms of the settlement in Reed, et al. v. State of California, et al.  
(Reed Judgment) based on detailed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  In the Reed 
Judgment, the Court reserved “exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the Action, 
Plaintiffs, the Settlement Class Members, LAUSD, the Partnership, and [United Teachers of 
Los Angeles (UTLA)] for purposes of supervising the implementation, enforcement, 
construction, and interpretation of the Agreement, the Court’s Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law and this Judgment.”  According to the Reed Judgment, pursuant to 
Education Code section 44955, subdivision (d)(2), the District may not impose any budget-
based layoffs of classroom teachers at 45 specified schools (Reed schools).  The Reed 
Judgment was based on findings that the layoff of the certificated staff in question would 
deprive particular students of their constitutional right to a fair education.  In its Findings of 
Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Court noted that UTLA was a party to the case, 
participated in settlement negotiations and was given an opportunity to present its arguments 
and establish why the settlement should not be approved.  UTLA appealed the Reed 
Judgment and unsuccessfully sought a stay in the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal.  
The California Supreme Court denied UTLA’s request for review.   
 
 
28(a).  At a prehearing conference in this matter, the ALJ granted the District’s 
 
“Motion to Exclude Evidence or Argument regarding issued litigated in Reed v. State and to 
Follow the Court’s Final Order,” and denied Respondents’ “Motion to Prohibit Waiver of 
Respondents’ Rights under Education Code section 44924” and “Motion in Limine,” 
requesting that the Reed Judgment not be followed in this proceeding.   
   
 
has jurisdiction to issue the Reed Judgment approving the skipping of teachers at 45 specified 
Reed schools.  The District is bound to comply with the Reed Judgment, and the ALJ lacks 
jurisdiction to require the District to contravene the Reed Judgment.  Arguments regarding 

28(b).  As stated in the ruling at the PHC:  The Superior Court has determined that it 

12 

the application of Education Code section 44955, subdivision (d)(2), in relation to the 
skipping of teachers at the 45 Reed schools, and its effects on teacher seniority rights, were 
addressed by the Superior Court, and the ALJ declines to address any arguments regarding 
the propriety of the Reed Judgment.  Any issues regarding the District’s compliance with the 
Reed Judgment should be addressed to the Superior Court which has retained jurisdiction, 
and any issues regarding the propriety of the Superior Court’s judgment should be addressed 
to the Court of Appeal, not to the ALJ.  It is noted that, in addition to declining to contravene 
the Reed Judgment, this ALJ also declines to apply it beyond its scope.15   
 
 
29.  As required by the Reed Judgment, the District must deviate from seniority in 
a limited manner in that no classroom teachers at any of the 45 Reed specified schools shall 
be included in the 2011 layoff.  According to the Reed Judgment, to ensure that the skipping 
of the Reed teachers does not negatively affect students at other “vulnerable” schools, the 
redirected layoff notices were to be “sent on a seniority basis to teachers at LAUSD schools 
that would otherwise receive less than district-wide average [layoff] notices.”  Additionally, 
the Reed Judgment specified that, although the District was prohibited from imposing any 
“budget-based” layoffs of the Reed teachers, the mandated skipping did not apply to either 
displacements (i.e. elimination of a teacher’s position at a school site) as a result of district 
wide class size increase, declining enrollment or termination.     
 
 
30.  Given the District’s uncertainty regarding whether the ALJ would uphold the 
Reed Judgment and the uncertainty regarding possible issues of displacement, teachers at the 
Reed schools received “precautionary” preliminary layoff notices stating:     
 

 

As you may be aware, the Los Angeles Unified School District 
continues to face a dire financial situation. While the District hopes that 
solutions may be found to mitigate this crisis, it is with sincere regret 
that I must send you this letter at this time. 

The District has initiated formal proceedings to lay off a number of 
probationary and permanent employees based on a reduction or 
discontinuance of particular kinds of services. Pursuant to judicial 
orders issued in the matter of Sharail Reed, et al. v. State of California, 
et al., the District has determined to “skip” classroom teachers at forty-
five (45) qualifying District schools. This means that the District seeks 
to exempt these employees from layoff for the 2011-2012 school year 
regardless of seniority. 
 
You are assigned as a classroom teacher at a school affected by the 
Reed lawsuit. Therefore, the District has identified you as one of the 
employees to be “skipped” during this layoff process. You continue to 

15 Respondents have raised no new matter in their closing brief or closing argument 

                                                 
 
that would warrant a reversal of the ALJ’s prior ruling. 
 

13 

be subject to displacement as a result of District-wide class size 
increases, declining enrollment, or termination for cause.  
 
Although the District believes that the skipping criteria is valid, the 
District anticipates challenges to the skipping criteria.   
 
If for any reason the skipping criteria is held unenforceable you will be 
subject to layoff. Therefore, you are being given the following notice 
which applies to permanent employees who are to be released pursuant 
to the layoff provisions of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. 
You are also being offered all of the rights and duties set forth in the 
notice. However, some of those rights may be waived if you do not take 
timely action.  
 
If the skipping criteria is held valid, and you are not displaced and laid 
off from employment, the District will provide you with a notice of 
assignment prior to June 30, 2011. 
 

Layoff Notice 

 
This letter constitutes notice to you that the Governing Board of the 
Los Angeles Unified School District has authorized a reduction in force 
of personnel effective the close of June 30, 2011. 
 
Pursuant to Education Code Sections 44949 and 44955, you will be laid 
off effective the close of June 30, 2011. As an additional notification to 
you, there is no probationary or permanent certificated employee with 
less seniority who will be retained to render service which you are 
certificated and competent to render, unless otherwise permitted by 
law. 
 
In accordance with the provisions of Education Code Sections 44949 
and 44955, you may request a hearing to determine whether there is 
cause for the layoff. A request for a hearing must be in writing and 
must be received by the undersigned on or before March 22, 2011 by 
5:00 p.m., which is not less than seven days after this notice was sent to 
you. A form to request a hearing is enclosed for your convenience. 
Copies of Sections 44949 and 44955 are also enclosed for your 
information and reference. 
 
If you fail to request a hearing on or before March 22, 2011, your 
failure to do so shall constitute a waiver of your right to a hearing. You 
need not request a hearing or appear at the hearing in order to retain the 
reemployment rights guaranteed by Education Code Section 44956.  
 

14 

If you do request a hearing, future notices will be sent to you regarding 
your rights and obligations. Failure to timely respond to these notices 
may constitute a waiver of your right to a hearing or may otherwise 
adversely impact your rights. 

 
 
31(a).  At the PHC, the ALJ ordered the District, by April 18, 2011, to rescind the 
precautionary notices issued to any teachers protected from layoff by the Reed Judgment 
after any displacements were ascertained.  When the rescission order was made at the PHC, 
it was with the understanding that the District would be able to ascertain displacement 
information prior to the evidentiary hearing and dismiss Reed precautionary notices.   
However, the District was unable to ascertain which Reed Respondents would be displaced 
prior to the evidentiary hearing.  At the evidentiary hearing, the ALJ denied Respondents’ 
Motion to Dismiss the Precautionary Notices, noting that if junior Reed teachers were 
displaced, they became part of the pool of teachers subject to the budget-based layoff, where 
the seniority provisions of the Education Code control the order of layoff.   
 
 
31(b).  Since Respondent’s case-in-chief commenced before the District was able to 
ascertain which Reed teachers would be displaced, the ALJ ordered that:  (1) there would be 
a rebuttable presumption that no displacements would occur, and (2)  even if the presumption 
was rebutted, the District would not be allowed to present evidence regarding the need to 
skip any displaced Reed teachers.   
 
 
31(c).  The presumption was rebutted.  During the course of the evidentiary hearing, 
after receiving the budget information from all school sites, including the Reed schools, the 
District determined which of the junior Reed school teachers would be displaced to schools 
other than the Reed schools.  Since they would be outside the scope of the Reed Judgment, 
those teachers would remain subject to layoff, and their precautionary notices were not 
rescinded.     
 
Rescinded Layoff Notices  
 
 
layoff notice and Accusation served on Respondent Moises Flores (#760045), who was 
inappropriately noticed for layoff.   
 . 
33.  During the hearing, the parties stipulated that the District would rescind the 
 
layoff notice served on Respondent Victoria Overbey (# 803980), who was “over-noticed” 
for layoff.   
 
 
11 redirected layoff notices.  Denise Piscitello (#759977) received the eleventh and final 
redirected notice at Madison.  However, Patricia Baker, who is less senior than Respondent 
Piscitello, should have received the final redirected notice, but did not.  Since Respondent 
Piscitello should not have received a layoff notice, the District rescinded the layoff notice 
and Accusation served on Respondent Piscitello. 

32.  During the hearing, the parties stipulated that the District would rescind the

36(a).  After determining which of the junior Reed school teachers would be displaced 
to schools other than the Reed schools (and therefore subject to layoff), the District rescinded 
the redirected notices sent to 209 Respondents.  The District also rescinded the precautionary 
notices sent to the 310 teachers who would remain at Reed schools.

Melgar (#637063) terminated his employment with the District on June 30, 2002, and had a 
break in service until February 10, 2003.  His correct RIF seniority date is February 10, 2003.  
Thus, Mr. Melgar is less senior than Respondent Ingrid Villeda (#772433), who has a RIF 
seniority date of December 2, 2002.  In light of his lower seniority, Mr. Melgar, and not 
Respondent Villeda, should have been the recipient of a redirected layoff notice at Stanford 
Avenue Elementary School pursuant to the Reed Judgment.  As the appropriate remedy, the 
District agreed to rescind the RIF notice sent to Respondent Villeda.   
 
 
Stockwell and Ajay Upadhyay received rescissions of their redirected notices after testifying 
at the evidentiary hearing.  Given the rescission of their layoff notices, their issues will not be 
addressed in this decision.

37(c).  Alessaundra Mills, a Library Media teacher who appeared at the hearing and 
who entered into a partial stipulation without testifying, also falls within the list of Library 
Media teachers whose layoff notices will be rescinded.  

 
 
38(a).  During the hearing, the parties stipulated that the following Respondents are

Finding 42) which allowed her to bump into a social studies position, thus resulting in the 
rescission of her layoff notice.

Finding 39) which allowed her to bump into a English position, thus resulting in the 
rescission of her layoff notice.

Bumping Applied to Teachers 
 
 
42.    Phillip Koch and Janet Larson.  After the last day of testimony, but prior to 
oral argument, the District confirmed that, due to the rescission of Reed precautionary and 
redirected notices, the layoff cut-off date for social studies had moved. Therefore, the District 
agreed that both Respondent Phillip Koch (#545284) and Respondent Janet Larson 
(#790013) are certificated and competent, and have sufficient seniority, to bump into social 
studies (SST) positions.20 Consequently, the Accusations against Respondents Koch and 
Larson should be dismissed, and they should not be issued a final layoff notices. 
 

43.  Kathleen Hickman.  During the hearing, the parties stipulated that Kathleen 

44(a).  Walter Rodriguez.  In lieu of testimony, the parties stipulated to the following 

Hickman (#799782) meets the competency criteria to teach English, but does not have 
sufficient seniority to bump into an English position.  Respondent Hickman did not establish 
that she has sufficient seniority to bump into an English position. 
 
 
facts:  Walter Rodriguez (#780426) has a RIF seniority date of August 28, 2003.  He is 
assigned to Stephen White Middle School. He holds a clear multiple subject credential, a 
supplemental mathematics credential and a Cross-cultural, Language and Academic 
Development (CLAD) authorization.  He obtained his credential to teach mathematics and 
registered it with the District prior to March 15, 2011.   However, he has not taught 
mathematics in the District.  Respondent Rodriguez did not establish that he meets the 
competency criteria required to bump into a mathematics position. 

 
45(a).  Hector Hernandez.  Respondent Hector Hernandez (#706754) has been 

working for the District since 2008 as a counselor.  He seeks to bump into a mathematics 
position based on his prior experience teaching mathematics in another school district.  He 
has not taught mathematics in the District.   
 

45(b).  Respondent Hernandez argued that, because he was found competent to teach 
mathematics in the 2010 layoff proceeding, this finding is res judicata.  However, the 2010 
determination that Respondent Hernandez was competent to teach mathematics was based on 
the ALJ invalidating the District’s competency criteria (the 1-in-3 recency requirement) in 

20 Both Respondents Koch and Larson have RIF seniority dates of September 2, 2005. 

                                                 
 
The District originally stipulated that both Respondents Koch and Larson met the 
competency criteria to bump into a social studies position, but lacked sufficient seniority to 
bump into those positions.  Thereafter, the District rescinded all the Reed redirected layoff 
notices for the social studies teachers with a September 2, 2005 RIF seniority date.  The 
District also rescinded the Reed redirected RIF notices for Wilfrido Magana (#643805; RIF 
seniority date 9/6/05) and Nelson Obregon (#79834; RIF seniority date 9/9/05), both of 
whom had less seniority than Respondents Koch and Larson.  Respondents Koch and Larson 
are certificated and competent, and now have sufficient seniority, to bump into social studies 
positions.   
 

20 

that proceeding.  Respondent Hernandez does not meet the current competency criteria, 
which requires experience teaching in the subject area within the District.  Respondent 
Hernandez did not establish that he meets the competency criteria required to bump into a 
mathematics position. 

 
46. 

Roger Wilson.  Respondent Roger Wilson (#266015) is serving as a health 

teacher, but seeks to bump into a science position.  He has a life credential in physical 
education with a supplementary authorization in health science.  He previously held a 
supplementary authorization in general science, which he allowed to lapse many years ago.  
After being served with a layoff notice as a health teacher, he applied for reinstatement of his 
supplementary authorization in general science, and obtained reinstatement on June 2, 2011.  
However, he has not taught any science courses in the past five years.  Respondent Wilson 
did not establish that he is competent to bump into a science position. 
 
Bumping Applied to Counselors 
 

47(a).  The counselors who received layoff notices as elementary school counselors 

and as Pupil Services and Attendance (PSA) counselors sought to maintain their positions by 
virtue of their relative seniority to all counselors (including secondary counselors).  They 
argued that there is no distinction between counseling positions by virtue of their identical 
Pupil Personnel Services (PPS) credential authorizing them to provide counseling services in 
grades K through 12.  However, this argument was not persuasive.   

 
47(b).  While their credential may authorize them to perform certain services, this 

does not automatically mean that they are performing those services.  Based on the 
counselors’ testimonies, elementary counselors and PSA counselors do not perform all of the 
same duties as secondary counselors --  e.g. master scheduling; tracking graduation credits 
and A through G college entrance requirements; and advising students regarding the 
California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE) and the Scholastic Aptitude Test 
(SAT).  Several of the elementary counselors were unfamiliar with the duties of secondary 
counselors, and at least one elementary counselor and one PSA counselor did not know what 
the CAHSEE was.  Consequently, the District’s distinction in classification between 
elementary counselors, PSA counselors and secondary counselors was reasonable.   
 

47(c).  Given the distinction between the classifications, those counselors seeking to 
bump into secondary counseling positions must meet the District’s competency criteria.  All 
of the counselors who testified established that they were “certificated” to bump into 
secondary counseling positions.  However, the counselors’ possession of a PPS credential 
does not automatically render them competent to provide services as a secondary counselor.  
They are also required to meet the recency requirement of the District’s competency criteria; 
that is, they must have one year of full-time-equivalent experience within the District within 
the preceding five years “serving in the subject area of the assignment” (i.e. serving a 
secondary counseling position).

48.  Megan Brown.  During the hearing, the parties stipulated that Respondent 

Megan Brown (#690347) is a PSA counselor who meets the competency criteria for a 
secondary counseling position, but does not have sufficient seniority to bump into a 
secondary counseling position.  Respondent Brown did not establish that she has sufficient 
seniority to bump into a secondary counseling position. 
 

49.  Kathy Torres and Nicole Mitchell.  During the hearing, the parties stipulated 

that Respondents Kathy Torres (#754397) and Nicole Mitchell (#712268) meet the 
competency criteria for secondary counseling positions, but do not have sufficient seniority 
to bump into secondary counseling positions.  Respondents Torres and Mitchell did not 
establish that they have sufficient seniority to bump into secondary counseling positions. 
 

50. 

Linet Danoukh and Jennifer Rios.  During the hearing, the parties stipulated 

that Respondents Linet Danoukh (#779869) and Jennifer Rios (#809347) are PSA counselors 
who meet the competency criteria for secondary counseling (CMS) positions, but do not have 
sufficient seniority to bump into secondary counseling (CMS) positions.  Respondents 
Danoukh and Rios did not establish that they have sufficient seniority to bump into 
secondary counseling positions. 
 

51. 

Emilia Zarookian.  During the hearing, the parties stipulated that Respondent 
Emilia Zarookian (#769488) meets the recency requirement to bump into a Least Restrictive 
Environment (LRE) counselor position (Class Code 0506), but does not have sufficient 
seniority to bump into an LRE counselor position.  Respondent Zarookian did not establish 
that she has sufficient seniority to bump into an LRE counselor position.

Susan (Naber) De La Pena.  Respondent Susan (Naber) De La Pena (#760590; 

Brenda Rhue-Long (#771633; RIF seniority date 6/11/07) meets the competency criteria to 
bump into an LRE counselor position, but does not have sufficient seniority to bump into an 
LRE counselor position.  Respondent Rhue-Long did not establish that she has sufficient 
seniority to bump into an LRE counselor position. 
 
 
RIF seniority date 7/1/02) worked for the District as a secondary counselor from July 1, 
2002, until January 2006.  At that point, she began providing services as an elementary 
school counselor, and has continuously provided services as an elementary school counselor 
since the beginning of the 2006-2007 school year.  She did not establish that, as an 
elementary counselor, she has one year of full-time-equivalent experience within the District 
within the preceding five years serving in the area of secondary counseling.  Despite her 
prior experience, Respondent De La Pena did not establish that she meets the specified 
competency criteria required to bump into a secondary counseling position. 
 
 
54.  Margaret Mulder.  Respondent Margaret Mulder (#228657; RIF seniority date 
8/28/03) is currently assigned as an elementary counselor.  During the 2008-2009 school year 
(four days per week) and the 2009-2010 school year (2 to 3 days per week), she was assigned 
as a counselor at Utah Avenue School (Utah), which spans kindergarten through eighth

grade.  While working at Utah, she had some limited experience interacting with students in 
sixth, seventh and eighth grade (e.g. she helped with middle school students during a lock 
down; she participated in a college career day; and she conducted an anti-bullying survey, 
meeting with seventh and eighth grade students over 10 partial days to administer the 
survey).  However, her “major focus” was the elementary grades, and she generally worked 
with students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  She did not establish that she has one year 
of full-time-equivalent experience within the District within the preceding five years serving 
in the area of secondary counseling.  Respondent Mulder did not establish that she meets the 
competency criteria required to bump into a secondary counseling position. 
 
 
elementary school counselor for the District since November 2004.  During her employment 
with the District, she has never served as a secondary counselor.  She did not establish that, 
as an elementary counselor, she has one year of full-time-equivalent experience within the 
District within the preceding five years serving in the area of secondary counseling.  
Respondent Romero did not establish that she meets the competency criteria required to 
bump into a secondary counseling position.

October 2001.  She did not establish that, as an elementary counselor, she has one year of 
full-time-equivalent experience within the District within the preceding five years serving in 
the area of secondary counseling.  Respondent Armstrong did not establish that she meets the 
competency criteria required to bump into a secondary counseling position. 
 
 
of August 30, 2001.  She was originally hired as a secondary counselor, but has been 
assigned as an elementary school counselor for the past five years.  She did not establish that, 
as an elementary counselor, she has one year of full-time-equivalent experience within the 
District within the preceding five years serving in the area of secondary counseling.  
Respondent Friedkin did not establish that she meets the competency criteria required to 
bump into a secondary counseling position. 
 
 
58.  Martha Gonzalez-White.  Respondent Martha Gonzalez-White (#742701; RIF 
seniority date 9/14/00) has been an elementary school counselor since she began working in 
the District in 2000.  She did not establish that, as an elementary counselor, she has one year 
of full-time-equivalent experience within the District within the preceding five years serving 
in the area of secondary counseling.  Respondent Gonzalez-White did not establish that she 
meets the competency criteria required to bump into a secondary counseling position. 
  
 
3/9/01) has been an elementary school counselor in the District for the past five years.  
During the decade she has worked for the District, she has never been assigned to a

the area of secondary counseling.  Respondent Cooper did not establish that she meets the 
competency criteria required to bump into a secondary counseling position. 
 
Cynthia McKinnon-Spurling.  Respondent Cynthia McKinnon-Spurling 
 
(#260195) is an elementary counselor.  For the 2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009, and 
2009-2010 school years, she was assigned only to elementary schools.  She is currently 
assigned (for the 2010-2011 school year) to three schools:  Vernon Avenue Elementary, one 
day per week;  109th Street Elementary, two days per week; and Caroldale Learning 
Community, two days per week.  Caroldale Learning Community serves students from 
kindergarten through eighth grade.  Although she identifies herself in documents (resume 
and signature line for letters) as an elementary counselor, Respondent McKinnon-Spurling 
provides services to both elementary and secondary students at Caroldale (e.g. she deals with 
student behavior, curriculum, assigning classes, meeting parents and community referrals for 
both elementary and secondary students at Caroldale).  However, she only provides two days 
of counseling services per week at Caroldale, and during those days she provides counseling 
to elementary students (K -5) as well as secondary students (6-8).  This constitutes less than 
“75 % of the days during the qualifying school year” providing secondary counseling 
services.  Although Respondent McKinnon-Spurling asserts that she is responsible for the 
Caroldale students all of the days of the week because she sometimes fields calls regarding 
those students while at the two other campuses, this assertion was not persuasive and did not 
support her contention that she meets the requirement of providing secondary counseling 
services for “at least 75 % of the days during the qualifying school year.”  Respondent 
McKinnon-Spurling did not establish that she has one year of full-time-equivalent experience 
within the District within the preceding five years serving in the area of secondary 
counseling.  Consequently, she did not establish that she meets the competency criteria 
required to bump into a secondary counseling position. 
 

61.  Oma Ray.  Respondent Oma Ray (#756403) has an adjusted RIF seniority date 

 
62.  Angela Frierson.  Respondent Angela Frierson (#703816) has an adjusted RIF 

of August 13, 2001.  (See Factual Finding 71 regarding adjusted RIF seniority date.)  Since 
2001, she has worked in the District only as an elementary school counselor.  She did not 
establish that, as an elementary counselor, she has one year of full-time-equivalent 
experience within the District within the preceding five years serving in the area of 
secondary counseling.  Respondent Ray did not establish that she meets the competency 
criteria required to bump into a secondary counseling position 
 
 
seniority date of July 1, 1999 (See Factual Finding 72 regarding adjusted RIF seniority date.)  
Since joining the district, she has been assigned as an elementary teacher (July 1999 through 
June 2005) and as an elementary counselor (September 2005 through present).  She did not 
establish that, as an elementary counselor, she has one year of full-time-equivalent 
experience within the District within the preceding five years serving in the area of 
secondary counseling.  Respondent Frierson did not establish that she meets the competency 
criteria required to bump into a secondary counseling position

63.   Yvette Zavala.  Respondent Yvette Zavala (#632341; RIF seniority date 

 
1/25/05) has been assigned as a PSA counselor in a secondary school (Bret Harte Middle 
School) for over five years.  She holds a PPS credential with authorizations in both School 
Counseling and School Child Welfare and Attendance.  Her Child Welfare and Attendance 
authorization allows her to provide services as a PSA counselor, which involves addressing 
students’ attendance and truancy issues.  She initially testified that she performs the same 
services as a secondary counselor and that a PSA counselor’s and secondary counselor’s 
duties are interchangeable.  However, she later noted differences in their duties.  For 
example, secondary counselors answer students’ questions regarding class selection and 
scheduling, which she does not.  She has never prepared a master schedule or assigned 
students to classes.  She was unfamiliar with the CAHSEE examination and believed that, if 
students pass the CAHSEE, they do not have to finish high school.  Respondent Zavala did 
not establish that, as a PSA counselor, she has one year of full-time-equivalent experience 
within the District within the preceding five years serving in the area of secondary 
counseling.  Respondent Zavala did not establish that she meets the competency criteria 
required to bump into a secondary counseling position. 
 
Library Media Teachers 
 
 
64.  As indicated above (Factual Findings 37, 39 and 42), the District rescinded all 
but 10 of the library media teachers’ layoff notices, and also agreed that two of those 10 had 
the right to bump into alternate positions.  Respondents now argue that the remaining eight 
library media teachers should be retained if they are certificated and competent to bump into 
a subject area.  This assertion is correct.  However, while it was established that library 
media teachers are teachers, that they possess subject matter credentials in addition to their 
library media credentials, and that they engage in teaching various subjects at various times 
while discharging their library media teacher responsibilities, this does not mean that they 
automatically meet the District’s competency criteria.  The eight library media teachers who 
remain subject to layoff did not testify, and thus did not contradict evidence of the District’s 
determination that nobody less senior than Respondents was being retained to render services 
which Respondents are certificated and competent to render.  Therefore, the evidence did not 
establish that each of these individuals is certificated and competent to bump into specific 
positions.  Consequently, the remaining eight library media teachers have not established any 
basis for rescission of their layoff notices or dismissal of the Accusations against them.

65(a).  Jennifer Preuss.  Respondent Jennifer Preuss (#754705) sought to have her RIF 

65(b).  During Respondent Preuss’ testimony, the District moved to preclude her

seniority date adjusted from September 1, 2006, which is the effective date of her first 
probationary contract.   
 
 
testimony and documentary evidence based on the District’s prior Motion re: Res Judicata 
Effect of Final Layoff Notices.21  The motion was granted in part, and Respondent Preuss 
was precluded, by the doctrine of res judicata, from presenting any testimony or evidence 
regarding the effect of her attendance at an August 2006 training session on her RIF seniority 
date.  Any testimony and evidence regarding that issue will not be considered in this decision 
in determining her RIF seniority date.  However, the motion was denied with regard to her 
claim to adjust her seniority date to October 10, 2005, based on service during the 2005-2006 
school year, since this issue was not fully addressed in the 2010 layoff decision.   
 
   
following:   
 
 
attendance at an August 2006 new staff professional development should be considered in 
determining her RIF seniority date (ie. first date of paid probationary service).  She relied on 
a May 2010 letter from her principal stating that the August attendance was mandatory, and 
on sign-in sheets from the training.  In the 2010 Proposed Decision, the ALJ addressed this 
evidence and found that Respondent Preuss failed to establish a basis for adjusting her RIF 
seniority date by virtue of the earlier training days.  This finding was adopted, and the 
District’s decision was not challenged by Respondent Preuss through any mandamus action 
in superior court.  In this 2011 layoff proceeding, Ms. Preuss sought to testify and present 
identical evidence regarding whether her attendance at the August 2006 new staff 
professional development should be considered in determining her RIF seniority date.  She 
presented no new evidence regarding this issue.

21 At the Pre-hearing Conference, the District filed a Motion re: Res Judicata Effect of 

Final Layoff Notices Issued in 2010 (Motion  re: Res Judicata Effect, marked as OAH 4), 
seeking to prevent identified employees who received final notices of layoff in 2010 from re-
litigating their employment related issues, such as seniority rights, in this 2011 proceeding.  
The Motion re: Res Judicata Effect was denied without prejudice, because it was unclear at 
that point whether the issues that may be raised by the identified employees in this new 
proceeding would be a re-litigation of the same issues that arose in 2010, and that no new 
evidence had arisen or change had occurred.  Although not efficient as a blanket objection, 
the ALJ allowed the Motion re: Res Judicata Effect to be made on an individual basis, 
depending on the evidence that the employee sought to present.

The rule regarding exhaustion of judicial remedies “is a form of res 

California Supreme Court noted that the doctrine of res judicata “can be as important to 
orderly administrative procedure as to orderly court procedure,” but also noted that “greater 
flexibility is required in applying the doctrine of res judicata” to administrative 
determinations.  The doctrine of collateral estoppel does not necessarily bar a new hearing on 
a previously litigated issue, where there was a change of circumstances or new facts.

judicial remedy for reviewing administrative action.”  (Briggs v. City of Rolling Hills Estates 
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 637, 646.)   Respondent Preuss’ failure to challenge the adverse 2010 
findings through administrative mandamus in superior court now estops her from relitigating 
the same issue regarding the effect of her attendance at the August 2006 training on her RIF 
seniority date.   
 
65(d).  Respondent Preuss contends that her RIF seniority date should be October 10, 
 
2005.  On that date, she began serving as a Title I reading intervention specialist, three hours 
per day, Monday through Thursday.  Since she was not scheduled to work on Fridays, she 
was available to substitute on Fridays as needed.  The contracts she signed while serving in a 
categorical position as an intervention specialist also indicated her status as a substitute.  
Respondent Preuss did not establish a basis to adjust her RIF seniority date. 
 
 
January 28, 2005, when he signed his first probationary contract.  He contends that his 
correct seniority date is August 28, 2003, when he signed the first of two temporary 
contracts, under which he served until he signed his probationary contract.  He believes his 
service under those temporary contracts should be credited for purposes of his seniority date, 
pursuant to Education Code sections 44918.22  This argument is without merit.  Section 
44918 is not applicable to the District, since the District has an ADA above 400,000 
students.  Consequently, Respondent Shin has not established a basis to adjust his RIF 
seniority date.

2007.23  On May 25, 2007, she signed an Early Entry Program Offer of Contract 
Employment as a probationary teacher, to commence services on or before August 31, 2007.  
From August 4 through 7, 2007, as part of her duties as yearbook advisor, she attended a 
yearbook camp to chaperone six of her yearbook students and to complete yearbook advisor 
training.  Her attendance at the camp was discussed at the time she was hired, and the 
District paid the entrance fee for the camp.  As yearbook advisor for the entire 2007-2008 
school year, she was paid a stipend of $2200 (in at least two payments over the course of the 
year), which was to cover her duties as yearbook advisor including camp chaperone duties.  
Respondent Welsh established that she began providing probationary services as a yearbook 
advisor on August 4, 2007.  Consequently, her RIF seniority date should be adjusted to 
August 4, 2007.

listed her employee number, name, address, phone number, assignment and District’s 
assigned seniority date of September 4, 2007.  At the time she signed the document, she 
informed the person having her sign it that her designated seniority date was inaccurate, but 
she was not told what action she could take to correct the seniority date.  Nothing on the 
Verification Roster indicated that she was agreeing to the seniority date, nor that she was 
waiving her right to challenge her assigned RIF seniority date at this hearing.

Suzanne Waisbren.  Respondent Suzanne Waisbren (#737442) has been 

assigned a RIF seniority date of February 13, 2007.  She claims that her correct RIF seniority 
date should be November 14, 2005, when she began teaching in her own classroom at 
Reseda Elementary School (Reseda) under a 30-day permit.  She continued working in the 
same classroom for the rest of the 2005-2006 school year, and in the interim, on January 20, 
2006, she was issued a university internship credential.  The District retained her to teach in 
her own classroom for the 2006-2007 school year, and on February 13, 2007, she was issued 
a preliminary credential and entered into a probationary contract.  Respondent Waisbren’s 
prior contracts were not presented in evidence, and the District’s employment classification 
for her under those contracts was not established.  The District points to Respondent 
Waisbren’s initial 30-day permit and asserts that she was a temporary employee.  However, 
the District did not establish that, at any point prior to February 13, 2007, Respondent 
Waisbren was properly classified as a temporary or substitute employee.24  By default, 
Respondent Waisbren is presumed to have been serving as a probationary employee at that 
time.25  Consequently, her RIF seniority date should be adjusted to November 14, 2005.    
 
 
Curtis Wynkoop.  Respondent Curtis Wynkoop (#805880) has a RIF seniority 
date of October 3, 2006.  He asserts that his correct RIF seniority date is September 6, 2006.  
Respondent Wynkoop provided service as a substitute for the 2005-2006 school year.  On 
July 21, 2006, he signed documents indicating his availability for employment as a day-to-
day substitute for the 2006-2007 school year.  On September 6, 2006, he began working in a 
substitute capacity at Hesby Oaks School.  He taught for the entire 2006-2007 school year in 
the same assignment.  On October 2, 2006, he signed a probationary contract, and on 
October 3, 2006, he also signed a Verification of Seniority Date verifying that his first date 
of paid probationary contract service was October 3, 2006.  Respondent Wynkoop failed to 
establish a basis to adjust his RIF seniority date. 
 
 
of August 30, 2001.  She asserts that her correct RIF seniority date is August 1, 2001, 
because that is the date she believes she began providing services to the district around three 
weeks to a month prior to the first day of instruction.  She did not provide any evidence to

Cal.4th 911, 916-917, in which it was held that “probationary” is the default classification.  
School districts must classify all teachers as probationary who are not otherwise required by 
the Education Code to be classified as permanent, temporary, or substitute.  The Kavenaugh 
Court concluded that the relevant Education Code sections revealed the Legislature’s intent 
that teachers be informed of their classification sufficiently early in the process to enable 
them to make informed decisions regarding their future employment.  (Id., at 921.)

establish the specific day she began providing services.  However, she signed a probationary 
contract on August 15, 2001, for services to commence on or before October 15, 2001, and 
her fingerprint clearance (required for her to be allowed to begin working for the District) 
was not obtained until August 20, 2001.  Respondent Friedkin failed to establish a basis to 
adjust her RIF seniority date. 
 

71.  Oma Ray.  Respondent Oma Ray (#756403) has been assigned a RIF seniority 

date of August 29, 2001.  She asserts that her correct RIF seniority date is August 13, 2001, 
because that is the date she began working as a counselor for the District.  On that date, 
students and teachers were on campus, and she was required to come into work and perform 
counseling duties.  A Verification of Seniority Date for Respondent Ray confirms that her 
“first day of paid probationary or District Intern contract service” was August 13, 2001.  
Respondent Ray established that her RIF seniority date should be adjusted to August 13, 
2001.      
  
 
72.  Angela Frierson.  Respondent Angela Frierson (#703816) has been assigned a 
RIF seniority date of September 9, 2005.  She contends that her correct seniority date is July 
1, 1999, because that is the date she purportedly began working as a teacher for the District.  
On July 9, 1999, Respondent Frierson signed a “provisional” contract for services as an 
elementary teacher for the 1999-2000 school year.  She began working on July 1, 1999, at a 
year-round school.  She continued working full time as an elementary teacher for the District 
under “provisional” contracts for the 2000-2001, 2001-2002, 2002-2003, 2003-2004, and 
2004-2005 school years.  A provisional contract refers to the type of credential held by the 
employee, not the status or classification of the employee.26  It does not state whether the 
teacher is a substitute, temporary or permanent employee.  From 1999 through the end of the 
2004-2005 school year, Respondent Frierson was working under pre-intern and emergency 
multiple subject permits.  On September 7, 2005, Respondent Frierson signed a probationary 
contract as and elementary counselor.  However, the District did not establish that, at any 
point prior to September 7, 2005, Respondent Frierson was properly classified as a 
temporary or substitute employee.  By default, pursuant to the Kavenaugh and Bakersfield 
cases, it is presumed that Respondent Frierson initially began serving as a probationary 
employee on July 1, 1999.  Consequently, her RIF seniority date should be adjusted to July 1, 
1999.

July 2, 2007, and possesses a multiple subject credential with an authorization to teach 
English.  She served as an elementary school teacher for two years, and then began teaching 
middle school English for the 2010-2011 school year.  She received her layoff notice as an 
elementary teacher, but seeks to be laid off as an English teacher since that is her current

assignment.  She admits that her seniority date is lower than other English teachers who are 
subject to layoff and that, even if she was classified as an English teacher, she would still be 
subject to layoff.  Although she should have received her layoff notice as an English teacher,

employee.  However, she has filed an action in the Los Angeles Superior Court challenging 
her non-reelection.  In the event the Superior Court orders her reinstatement, the District 
served her with a layoff notice, since she would be one of the secondary counselors subject 
to layoff.  Respondent Cox did not testify at the hearing.  Consequently, she did not establish 
any basis to rescind her layoff notice or to dismiss the Accusation against her 
 

Erica Cox.  The District considers Respondent Erica Cox to be a former

2(a).  The services identified in the Board’s Resolution are particular kinds of 

2(b).  Respondents argued that the District’s reduction of services was a “reduction 

in all teachers,” and sought to invalidate this reduction, citing Burgess v. Board of Education 
(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 571.  This argument was not persuasive.  The reasoning in Burgess has 
been rejected.  (See, San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 636; 
California Teachers Assn. v. Board of Trustees (1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 32, 36.)   
Respondents have cited no valid authority to support their assertion that the reductions by the 
Board did not constitute particular kinds of service pursuant to Education Code section 
44955.

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), provides, in pertinent part:  

[T]he services of no permanent employee may be terminated . . . while 
any probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority,

is retained to render a service which said permanent employee is certif-
icated and competent to render.   

  

8(a).  Social studies teacher Ramiro Guiterrez is being retained, even though he is 

junior to several Respondent social studies teachers who were noticed for layoff and have not 
had their layoff notices rescinded.  Respondents argue that all social studies teachers with 
greater seniority than Mr. Guitierrez must be retained.  However, Respondents provided no 
authority to would mandate this action.   
 
 
8(b).  Respondents rely on a literal interpretation of Education Code section 44955, 
subdivision (b).  This “domino theory” remedy is not supported by relevant legal authority.  
Instead, it has been suggested that the proper remedy is for “a corresponding number of the 
most senior of the employees” who did not receive layoff notices to have their notices 
withdrawn.  (Alexander v. Delano Joint Union High School District (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 
567, 576.)  Furthermore, Education Code section 44949, subdivision (c) (3), provides that 
“non-substantive procedural errors committed by the school district . . . shall not constitute 
cause for dismissing the charges unless the errors are prejudicial errors.”  Thus, when a 
school district inadvertently fails to give notice to one employee, that procedural error should 
only result in one corresponding respondent having his/her layoff notice withdrawn, since 
that employee would be viewed as the one suffering prejudice.  The other respondents would 
not be viewed as suffering prejudice from the mistaken failure to give notice to the 
employee, since they would have been subject layoff even if he/she had been properly 
noticed.     
 

9(a).  Pursuant to stipulation between the parties, the layoff notices issued to the 

 8(c).  In this case, the failure to serve Mr. Gutierrez with a layoff notice was the 
result of inadvertence.  Therefore, the appropriate remedy is to withdraw the layoff notice for 
the most senior social studies teacher who has not yet had his/her layoff notice rescinded.  
Given the size of the Seniority list, compounded by the complexity of the Reed redirected 
notices and subsequent rescissions, the ALJ has insufficient evidence to determine the 
identity of this individual. Consequently, the District shall be ordered to determine the 
identity of the most senior social studies teacher who has not yet had his/her layoff notice 
rescinded; the layoff notice and any Accusation against that individual shall be dismissed.
