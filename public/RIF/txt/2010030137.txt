The resolution provided: 

That “competency” as described in Education Code section 44955(b) for the 
purposes of bumping shall necessarily include possession of: (1) a valid credential in 
the relevant subject matter area; (2) “highly qualified” status under the No Child Left 
Behind Act in the position to be assumed; and (3) an appropriate formal (not 
emergency) EL authorization (if required by the position).

Candice Newman (seniority date of August 15, 2008) has a single subject 

The District created a Seniority List which contains employees’ seniority dates 

 
(first date of paid service), site, job description, department, credential description, and 
subjects.  The District used the Seniority List to develop a proposed layoff and “bumping” 
list of the least senior employees currently assigned in the two services being reduced.  The 
District then determined whether the least senior employees held credentials in another area 
and were entitled to “bump” other employees.  In determining who would be laid off for each 
kind of service reduced, the District counted the number of reductions not covered by the 
known vacancies, and determined the impact on incumbent staff in inverse order of seniority.  
The District then checked the credentials of affected individuals and whether they could 
“bump” other employees. 
 
 
preliminary credential in biology, and single subject credentials in chemistry and geology.  
She teaches two classes of chemistry and three classes of integrated science at Rancho 
Cucamonga High School and has been noticed for layoff.  She testified at the hearing that 
she has 36 students in her chemistry classes, and there are two other chemistry teachers at 
Rancho Cucamonga High School.  She is concerned that if she is laid off, the remaining 
teachers will have in excess of 50 students in their classes and their chemistry labs.  She 
testified there are nine to ten work spaces in the labs, and currently, with 36 students in a 
class, there are more than three students at each work station, but if the class size increased to 
more than 50, there would be more than five students per work station in the labs.  She noted 
that there were health hazards that would be exacerbated by the increased size of the classes, 
and that currently, 36 students were difficult to supervise, but 50 or more would be “chaos.”  
She added that she learned from the fire marshal that the maximum number of students 
permitted in a lab was 49.  
 
 
preliminary credential in biology and teaches physical science and biology at Chaffey High 
School.  She testified there are six biology teachers at Chaffey High School, and while she 
and one other teacher will be laid off, another teacher with be moved into a BTSA position, 
which is full-time, and that will result in a reduction of three biology teachers.  Since she 
presently has 35 students in her class, a reduction of half the number of biology teachers 
could double the size of the classes.

School. 
 
 
15.  Dresden Hauck has a single subject credential in English and teaches English 
at Etiwanda High School.  She is also a cheer advisor.  Her seniority date is August 21, 2008 
but believes it should be July 16, 2008. 
 
As a cheer advisor, Ms. Hauck is paid a stipend by the District in addition to her 
 
regular salary.  She testified she receives the stipend twice a year and is not required to 
document the hours she works as a cheer advisor, and she spends a great deal of time with 
the cheerleaders.

Ms. Hauck testified that when she was hired, Thomas Mitchell, the principal at 
Etiwanda High School, called her and said she would be offered a job that would take effect 
after the Board approved her hiring.  That occurred on July 15, 2008.  According to Ms. 
Hauck, Mr. Mitchell called her that day and told her to report for an orientation on July 16.  
That involved completing relevant paperwork.  She then went to cheerleading practice from 
2:00 to 4:00 that afternoon.  She testified she continued attending practice four times a week. 
 
 
Ms. Hauck testified that on July 29, 2008, she attended a cheer camp at San Diego 
State University.  She believed her attendance at the camp was expected of her.  The camp 
ended on August 2.  She lived in a dormitory with the cheerleading students and other 
teachers, including teachers from the District.  After she returned from the camp, she 
continued cheerleading practice four times a week. 
 
The District did not pay for the expenses associated with the cheer camp at SDSU.  
 
Ms. Hauck assumed she was paid for the cheerleading work she did during the summer and 
for attendance at the cheer camp. 
 
After the hearing concluded, the District reviewed its records and submitted several 
 
documents relating to Ms. Hauck’s employment and pay.  The records were marked Exhibit 
18 and admitted into evidence.  The records relevant to Ms. Hauck’s seniority date include: 
 
 
Ms. Ditfurth requesting Ms. Hauck be employed at Etiwanda as an English teacher, filling a 
new position, and the date needed is August 21, 2008.  In the administration office use box, 
the effective date is indicated as August 21, 2008. 
 
 
Mr. Mitchell requesting Ms. Hauck be employed at Etiwanda as a Pep Squad Advisor, 
replacing Michelle Coffey, and the date needed is the 2008-09 school year.  In the 
administration office use box, the effective date is indicated as August 21, 2008. 
 
 
the 2008-09 school year.  Ms. Hauck signed it July 2, 2008.  The offer indicates a salary at 
the level of Class C, step 6.  There is no reference to an offer of employment as a Pep Squad 
Advisor. 
 
 
A Board Agenda Item reflecting that at a board meeting on July 15, 
2008, Ms. Ditfurth recommended the employments of a number of certificated teachers, 
including Ms. Hauck to teach English. 
 
 
the school year began on July 1, 2008 and ended on June 30, 2009.  It further indicates Ms. 
Hauck would be paid her annual salary as a teacher, class D, step 6, beginning on August 21, 
2008 until June 10, 2009.  The contract reflects her salary as a teacher and as a pep squad 
assistant.  The contract indicates she is classified as a probationary teacher.

Her two science positions will be reduced.  The District’s bump analysis shows that she 
would bump into a math vacancy by virtue of her math credential, and, therefore, would not 
be laid off.  Candice Newman, who is more senior to Ms. Graham, however, does not hold a 
math single subject credential and therefore will be laid off as part of the reduction of two 
F.T.E. positions in physical science and four F.T.E. positions in Life Science.

The District proposes to reduce math by seven F.T.E. positions.  The bump analysis 

Ms. Culp is more senior than any of the English teachers the District proposes to lay 

 
indicates there is one vacant position in math, and, consequently, six teachers will be laid off.  
Ms. Ditfurth testified the District did not skip any science teachers and her intention is for 
Ms. Graham to teach math, not science, and that Ms. Graham would not be placed in a 
science position ahead of Ms. Newman.  Ms. Ditfurth testified there are always math courses 
for Ms. Graham to teach such as math intervention for students who need assistance with the 
math curriculum.  She also testified that she believed there was a math vacancy into which 
Ms. Graham could be placed in addition to the one indicated on the bump analysis.  Finally, 
she testified that Ms. Graham’s foundational math credential permits her to teach beyond the 
ninth grade. 
 
Patricia Guerra (seniority date of September 1, 1989) teaches in the Parenting 
 
Child Care Department.  The District proposes to reduce that department by one F.T.E.  Its 
bump analysis shows that she will bump Bonnie Culp (seniority date of August 28, 1997), a 
less senior teacher who teaches Homemaking and Child Development.  Ms. Culp also holds 
an English credential and will bump into a vacant English position.

19.  Marilyn Irwin (seniority date of October 19, 1983) is a librarian and holds a 
single subject credential in social science and a supplemental authorization in Introductory 
English.  The District proposes to bump her into a social studies position held by Jaclyn 
Smits (seniority date of October 18, 2007), who holds a single subject credential in social 
science, and who is the most senior social science teacher to be laid off. 
 
 
Ms. Ditfurth testified that Ms. Irwin with her supplemental authorization in English 
could teach some English classes in the ninth grade, but could not teach beyond that, and it 
was the practice of the District not to staff teachers only at the ninth grade level.  She 
testified a single subject credential in social science was preferable to the supplemental 
authorization in English for that reason. 
 
Vanessa Ressa (seniority date of August 15, 2008) and Gina Cantelletta (seniority 
 
date of January 22, 2008) have single subject credentials in English.  The District does not 
propose to lay off either of them.  According to Ms. Ditfurth, both of these teachers can teach 
English at any level, while Ms. Irwin cannot.  In her view, it is preferable to have Ms. Irwin 
bump into a social science position than into an English position.  The result is that Ms. 
Smits, who is senior to both Ms. Ressa and Ms. Cantteletta, would be laid off. 
 
 
librarian with a single subject credential in fine arts.  She is the most senior librarian who is 
to be laid off.  Arthur Olivas (seniority date of September 3, 1998) has a multiple subject 
credential and teaches fine arts, photography, and video. 
 
 
he is highly qualified to teach upper division students.

help them prepare for college.  Classes teach study skills, writing, organizational skills, and 
so forth.  It has its own curriculum and is not connected to any subject.  A teacher who 
teaches AVID does not need a particular credential, but instead receives training in the 
program.  AVID teachers also teach other subjects. 
 
 
Ms. Ditfurth also testified that all freshmen take a success course, but it is not 
required.  It is a part of curriculum and generally, students at Chaffey High School take it. 
 
 
Claudia Mercado (seniority date of August 20, 2007) has a single subject 
credential in social science and a supplemental authorization in art history.  She teaches 
social studies and two periods of art history, and will be bumped by Graciela Cortez 
(seniority date of August 30, 2001), a librarian.  Ms. Cortez could not teach art history.  In 
order to teach AP art history, a teacher needs an art history credential or art credential. 
 
 
history is a discretionary, elective assignment each year, it is not required, and she was not 
sure if it would be offered for the 2010-11 school year.  
 
 
education.  Ms. Ditfurth testified he should not bump into a sixth period physical education 
class (called athletics by the District), because he would then only teach one class a day, and 
it was the District’s practice not to hire teachers to teach one class a day. 
 
 
24.  Karina Ramirez (seniority date of August 7, 2009) is a special education 
teacher serving as a resource specialist at Chaffey High School and will be laid off as part of 
the District’s reduction of five F.T.E. positions.  She testified she serves 24 students in small 
groups or one-on-one.  She did not have her own classroom, and she was not sure if there 
were other resource specialists.  She testified that she is concerned about the ability of the 
remaining special education teachers to provide the services that special education students 
need. 
 
 
reduction in services depended on the reduction in the number of students, or the way 
services would be provided.  She testified the District draws no distinction between a 
resource specialist and a classroom teacher.  She did not know what effect the elimination of 
a resource specialist would have. 
 
 
The District proposes to eliminate all of the eight librarian positions.  Ms. 
Ditfurth testified the District could operate a library without a certificated librarian but a

Regarding the camps that Ms. Hauck and Ms. Dane attended prior to the 

librarian has to have a credential.  She explained the elimination of all of the library positions 
was a budget proposal and the District was negotiating this with the teachers’ association.  
She further explained that the District planned to cover all the services libraries provided but 
she did not know how the District would accomplish this.  
 
 
commencement of school, Ms. Ditfurth testified that attendance at the camps and the other 
duties the teachers performed in connection with the additional duties as a cheer or yearbook 
advisor did not count toward seniority.  She noted there were duties the teachers performed 
that were outside the school day or school year, and that the teachers were paid twice a year 
for performing those duties, once during each semester.  She testified that the duties advisors 
perform are at their discretion, and the District did not verify what work was done or what 
hours the advisors worked.  
 
Ms. Ditfurth testified that there was no requirement that the advisor attend a camp or 
 
do anything with students prior to the first day of school.  She did not know what Ms. Dane 
or Ms. Hauck had been told regarding what duties they should perform prior to the beginning 
of school.  She added that the District did not pay the expenses for Ms. Hauck or Ms. Dane to 
attend the summer camps, nor did it pay for the students to attend the camps. 
 
 
Prior to the hearing, the District sent an e-mail to all certificated employees and asked 
for any corrections to the seniority list.  At the hearing for the layoffs regarding the 2009-10 
school year, Ms. Hauck had sought to have her seniority date advanced based on her 
attendance at an orientation, but the District in its final decision did not change her seniority 
date.  Ms. Hauck did not seek to have her seniority date changed on the basis of her duties as 
a cheer advisor prior to this hearing. 
 
 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction in this matter relating to the elimination of 84.2 full-time 

 
 
equivalent positions exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.  All notices and 
jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied. 
 

2. 

Education Code section 44955 provides in relevant part: 

 

 

. . .  

 
(b) 
[W]henever a particular kind of service is to be reduced or discontinued not 
later than the beginning of the following school year . . . and when in the opinion of 
the governing board of the district it shall have become necessary . . . to decrease the 
number of permanent employees in the district, the governing board may terminate 
the services of not more than a corresponding percentage of the certificated 
employees of the district, permanent as well as probationary, at the close of the 
school year.  Except as otherwise provided by statute, the services of no permanent 
employee may be terminated under the provisions of this section while any 

11

probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to 
render a service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to 
render. . .  As between employees who first rendered paid service to the district on the 
same date, the governing board shall determine the order of termination solely on the 
basis of needs of the district and the students thereof.  Upon the request of any 
employee whose order of termination is so determined, the governing board shall 
furnish in writing no later than five days prior to the commencement of the hearing 
held in accordance with Section 44949, a statement of the specific criteria used in 
determining the order of termination and the application of the criteria in ranking 
each employee relative to the other employees in the group.  This requirement that the 
governing board provide, on request, a written statement of reasons for determining 
the order of termination shall not be interpreted to give affected employees any legal 
right or interest that would not exist without such a requirement. 
 
(c) 
 
 
manner that the employees shall be retained to render any service which their 
seniority and qualifications entitle them to render. . . 

The governing board shall make assignments and reassignments in such a 

. . . 

. . . 

(d) 
Notwithstanding subdivision (b), a school district may deviate from 
terminating a certificated employee in order of seniority for either of the following 
reasons: 

(1) 

The district demonstrates a specific need for personnel to teach a 

specific course or course of study, or to provide services authorized by a services 
credential with a specialization in either pupil personnel services or health for a 
school nurse, and that the certificated employee has special training and experience 
necessary to teach that course or course of study or to provide those services, which 
others with more seniority do not possess. 

(2) 

For purposes of maintaining or achieving compliance with 

constitutional requirements related to equal protection of the laws. 
 
 
To put it more succinctly, a senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the 
right to transfer to a continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to fill.  
In doing so, the senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling 
that position.  See Lacy v. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469.  Junior 
teachers may be given retention priority over senior teachers if the junior teachers possess 
superior skills or capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack.  See Poppers v. 
Tamalpais Union High School District (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 399; see also Santa Clara 
Federation of Teachers, Local 2393, v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified School 
District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831.

Regarding Findings 15, 16 and 17, respondents argue the District treated 

Regarding Finding 19, respondents argue that Ms. Irwin who bumped into a 

The same is true in the English department.  Ms. Ditfurth testified there was a vacant 

 
vacancies in the math and English departments differently, and this impacted certain teachers 
differently.  In the math department, the District proposes to reassign Ms. Graham from 
physical and life science to math based upon her credential in foundational math, and thus 
she would be retained, over Ms. Newman, who is senior to Ms. Graham but who cannot 
teach math.  While the bump analysis indicates there is one vacant math position, Ms. 
Ditfurth testified there were positions to which Ms. Graham could be assigned for the 2010-
11 school year in addition to the vacant math position listed on the bump analysis.  There is 
no reason to disbelieve Ms. Ditfurth that Ms. Graham will be assigned a math position if 
there is such a position available, and that she will not be retained to teach science at the 
expense of a more senior science teacher. 
 
 
English position into which Ms. Culp would be placed, despite the absence of such a position 
listed on the bump analysis.  Ms. Culp is more senior than any of the English teachers to be 
laid off.  There is no reason to believe that there is not a position available for Ms. Culp, and 
consequently, no reason to set aside the layoff of the most senior English teacher, Laurette 
Ortiz.  Respondents’ arguments are rejected. 
 
 
social studies position by virtue of her single subject credential in social science should have 
been assigned to the English department, thereby allowing the District to retain Ms. Smits.  
The District had legitimate reasons to choose to bump Ms. Irwin into social studies rather 
than English.  By virtue of her social science credential, she could teach any social studies 
course but she was limited to teaching ninth grade English because of her English 
supplemental authorization. 
 
 
and reassignments that allows it to retain employees to render any service which their 
seniority and qualifications permit.  The District’s decision to retain Ms. Irwin in a social 
studies position is neither arbitrary nor capricious, but rather a decision based on sound 
reasons.  Respondents’ argument that the District should assign Ms. Irwin to teach English so 
that Ms. Smits would not be laid off is an example of what is called “inverse bumping.”  
Such a proposal was rejected in Duax v. Kern Community College District (1987) 196 
Cal.App.3d 555, 568-69.  Although that was a community college layoff under Education 
Code section 87743, the assignment and reassignment language is identical to the assignment 
and reassignment language in section 44955(c). Respondents’ arguments are rejected. 
 
 
positions (Finding 25), respondents argue the District must keep at least one credentialed 
librarian and cannot operate the libraries solely with aides.  Respondents point to Title 5, 
California Code of Regulations, section 16043, and Education Code section 45344. 
 

Section 44955, subdivision (c) gives the District the authority to make assignments 

Regarding the District’s proposal to eliminate all of the eight librarian

Section 16043 provides: 

Persons employed by a school district as school librarians, assisted by other 

certificated personnel where deemed necessary, are responsible to perform the duties 
assigned by the school district governing board, including, but not limited to, 
supplementing classroom instruction, helping and instructing pupils in the choice and 
use of library materials, planning and coordinating school library programs with the 
instructional programs of a school district, selecting materials for school libraries, 
and conducting a planned course of instruction for those pupils who assist in the 
operation of school libraries, subject to such policies, rules and regulations as may 
be established by the governing board for the operation and utilization of school 
libraries. Classified personnel assigned school library duties are to be under the 
supervision of certificated personnel; instructional aides assigned to school libraries 
are subject to the provisions of Education Code Sections 45340 through 45349; 
pupils are under the supervision of certificated personnel. 
 
Respondents recognize that Brough v. Governing Board (1981) 118 Cal. App. 3rd 

 
702, 715 addresses the issue.  The court there held: 
 
 

The term “certificated personnel” under the terms of this statute does not necessarily 
connote certificated librarians as appellants suggest. Nowhere within section 16043 
is “certificated personnel” defined as a certificated librarian. The clear language of 
the section refers to any and all certificated personnel. The trial court determined that 
the certificated librarian, Rosenberg, was properly reassigned to a classroom 
position; her vacancy was filled by a certificated teacher with supervisory 
capabilities. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 5, § 16043.)

At present, the District has no certificated personnel assigned to serve as librarians, 

 
 
Respondents argue Brough is distinguishable because after the librarian was 
reassigned to a classroom position, her vacancy was filled by a certificated teacher, while in 
this case, the District does not propose to assign any certificated personnel to perform the 
duties of a librarian.  According to Ms. Ditfurth, the District planned to cover all the services 
libraries provided but she did not know how the District would accomplish this, and 
indicated the District and the teachers’ association were negotiating this issue. 
 
 
but, according to Brough, such personnel need not be certificated librarians.  Thus, the 
District is free to assign any certificated personnel to perform the services of a librarian. 
While Karman Johnson-Vega, as the most senior librarian proposed for layoff would be the 
best choice, the District is not required to select her.  It is premature to consider whether the 
District has violated its obligations under section 16043. 
 
 
Mr. Olivas, while senior to her, should have been reassigned to teach courses within his 
credential such as core courses in the ninth grade, and that would allow her to be assigned to 
teach Fine Arts/Photography/Video courses to which Mr. Olivas has been assigned. 
 

Regarding Finding 21, Ms. Johnson-Vega also argues she should be retained because 

 
 

 

14

6. 

Francesco Macchia (Finding 23) argues as a physical education teacher, he 

Ms. Ditfurth testified that Mr. Olivas is appropriately teaching photography because 

 
he is highly qualified to teach upper division students.  As with Ms. Irwin (Legal Conclusion 
4), the District reasonably could assign Mr. Olivas to teach this subject, and was not required 
to reassign him to another position in order to create an opening for Ms. Johnson-Vega. Duax 
v. Kern Community College District (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 555, supra.  The layoff of Ms. 
Johnson-Vega must be upheld. 
 
Mr. Davis (Finding 21) and Ms. Mercado (Finding 22) argue they should be 
 
retained because they can provide other services to the District:  AVID in Mr. Davis’ case 
and art history in Ms. Mercado’s case.  Neither of these subjects is required, and the District 
is free to provide them in the exercise of its discretion.  Respondents’ argument is without 
merit and is rejected. 
 
 
could teach sixth period athletics, and should be retained at least to the extent of 0.2 F.T.E., 
and he points to other non-physical education teachers who teach sixth period athletics.  The 
District’s reason for not retaining him, that it is not its practice to hire teachers to teach only 
one athletics class a day, is a reasonable one.  Mr. Macchia’s argument must be rejected. 
 
Respondents argue that the District should not reduce the number of teachers 
 
teaching such subjects as chemistry, biology, and special education because such reductions 
are irrational and not in the best interests of the students.  (Findings 13, 14, and 24.)  A 
school district may reduce particular kinds of services so long as the decision is reasonable 
and not fraudulent, arbitrary, or capricious.  Campbell Elementary Teachers Assn., Inc. v. 
Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 808.  A school district may reduce its offerings as long as 
it does not reduce them below code-mandated levels.  Id. at 811.  Respondents’ arguments 
are without merit. 
 
 
 

Education Code section 44845 provides: 

9. 

8. 

Every probationary or permanent employee employed after June 30, 1947, 

 
shall be deemed to have been employed on the date upon which he first rendered paid 
service in a probationary position. 

Education Code section 44929.27 provides: 

 
No employee of a school district or districts, in which the average daily 
attendance of all the districts combined is in excess of 200,000, governed by the same 
governing board shall hereafter acquire permanent certificated tenure or permanent 
noncertificated status, or a combination of tenure and status, for more than one full-
time position. Any employee who hereafter acquires any combination of permanent 
certificated tenure or permanent noncertificated status or both which exceeds that for 
one full-time position shall have a choice which tenure or status to retain so long as 
that retained does not exceed one full-time position. 
 

 
 
 

 

15

It is the intent of this section that an employee holding permanent certificated tenure 
or permanent noncertificated status for a full-time position may not have permanent 
tenure or status protection for any additional time in either a certificated or a 
noncertificated position under any such school district governed by the same 
governing board. 

A review of the documentary evidence submitted by the District after the hearing 

10.  Ms. Dane (Finding 16) and Ms. Hauck (Finding 15) argue the services they 

By the terms of the tentative contract, both Ms. Dane and Ms. Hauck were hired as 

 
 
provided as advisors during the summer of 2008 prior to the beginning of school on  
August 21, 2008, and in particular the services they provided to students while they attended 
camps in Palm Springs and San Diego, should cause their seniority dates to be advanced to 
the time they began to provide these services.  Based upon the testimony of Ms. Ditfurth 
(Finding 26), the District does not believe their seniority dates should be changed. 
 
 
concluded shows that both teachers were paid a stipend for their work as advisors in addition 
to being paid a regular salary as a teacher.  In particular, the District Personnel Requisition 
forms requesting that Ms. Dane and Ms. Hauck be employed as advisors indicate an effective 
date of August 21, 2008 and their services were needed for the 2008-09 school year.  The 
payroll records indicate the teachers were paid a fixed amount for their services as advisors, 
with the earliest payments coming in December 2008 (Ms. Dane) and February 2009 (Ms. 
Hauck).  There is no evidence that the teachers were required to keep records of the time they 
spent advising the students either before classes began or after school, nor is there evidence 
as to how much time they were required to spend with their students. 
 
 
English teachers for the 2008-09 school year.  The Board approved their employment as 
English teachers and the District then notified the San Bernardino County Superintendent of 
Schools that both were hired as new employees to teach high school English.  Their contracts 
of employment indicate they were hired as probationary teachers and only Ms. Hauck’s 
contract refers to an advisor position in addition to a teaching position. 
 
 
time with their students before school began on August 21, 2008, including the time at the 
camps.  Both were justified in believing they would be paid for their services as advisors, and 
both should be commended for committing the time and energy they did to their students.  
The question is whether the time they spent serving as advisors affects their seniority dates 
pursuant to section 44845. 
 
 
Based upon the evidence presented, it appears that section 44929.27 should be 
considered in determining Ms. Hauck’s and Ms. Dane’s seniority dates.  That statute limits 
tenure to one full-time position, and in this case, the full-time positions Ms. Hauck and Ms. 
Dane were hired to fill were as English teachers.  They were not hired in probationary 
positions as advisors.  They could not acquire tenure as advisors.  Their work as advisors was 
over and above their work as English teachers and the only benefit they received from 
performing that work was the stipend.  The stipends were paid for their work throughout the 
course of the school year and were not paid on an hourly or per diem basis.  According to the 

There is no question but that Ms. Hauck and Ms. Dane spent considerable amounts of 

 

16

The requests of Ms. Hauck and Ms. Dane to advance their seniority dates must also 

Collective Bargaining Agreement (Exhibit D, pps. 82, 85), their work as advisors was paid as 
“Other Duty Assignments Stipends,” while their salary as teachers was determined by a 
“Certificated Salary Schedule.”  Thus, it must be concluded that the seniority dates for Ms. 
Hauck and Ms. Dane must be based upon their employment as English teachers, and their 
first dates of paid service to the District in probationary positions was August 21, 2008. 
 
 
be rejected because neither teacher established their services as advisors provided prior 
August 21, 2008 was mandatory or a condition of their employment.  Both testified they 
were expected to perform such services, but neither offered any evidence to corroborate their 
testimony.  Neither showed, for example, that if they did not attend the camps or participate 
in cheer or yearbook activities prior to school beginning, their stipends would be reduced.  
Neither offered the testimony of the administrators who hired them or any documents to 
describe what they were told.  On the other hand, Ms. Ditfurth testified that there was no 
requirement that the advisor attend a camp or do anything with students prior to the first day 
of school.  
 
 
are rejected.  
 
 
to discontinue particular kinds of services relating to 84.2 full-time equivalent positions.  The 
cause for the reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related solely to the 
welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof.  A preponderance of the evidence sustained the 
charges set forth in the Accusation.  It is recommended that the Board give respondents 
notice before May 15, 2010, that their services will no longer be required by the District.  
 
 

11.  Any additional arguments offered by respondents have been considered and 

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the District

ORDER 

The Accusations served on the respondents listed on Exhibit A are sustained.  Notice 

 
 
shall be given to each respondent before May 15, 2010 that his or her services will not be 
required for the 2010-11 school year pursuant to the Board of Trustee’s resolution because of 
the reduction of particular kinds of services.
