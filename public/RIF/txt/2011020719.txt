FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Dr. Vic Ramos is the Superintendent of the Wheatland Union High School
District (a single school school district) and also the Principal of Wheatland Union High
School.

2.

On March 7, 2011, the Governing Board of the Wheatland Union High School
District (Board) adopted Resolution No. 10.68 entitled “Reduction in Certificated Staff Due
to Reduction or Elimination of Particular Kinds of Services” (PKS Resolution.) Pursuant to
the PKS Resolution, the Board determined it was necessary to reduce or eliminate certain
particular kinds of services and to decrease a corresponding number of certificated District
employees at the close of the 2010/2011 school year for the 2011/2012 school year. In the

PKS Resolution, the Board directed the Superintendent, or his designee, to send appropriate
notices to all employees1 to be affected by virtue of the PKS reduction and elimination.

3.

The PKS Resolution identified the following particular kinds of services for

reduction or elimination:

Services

Full-Time Equivalent

ACE Coordinator
Counselor
English
Math
Music
Spanish

Total

1.0
0.8
1.6
0.4
0.2
1.0

5.0

In arriving at its determination, the Board considered anticipated certificated

employee attrition (resignation, retirements, non-reelections, temporary teacher releases, etc.)
but nevertheless found it necessary to terminate certificated full-time equivalent positions.

4.

On March 7, 2011, the Board also passed Resolution No. 10.69, “Concerning
Order of Seniority of Certificated Employees First Rendering Paid Probationary Service on
the Same Day” and established the following criteria to be applied, in the order listed, to
determine the relative seniority of those certificated employees who first rendered paid
probationary service on the same day:

Possession of a credential which meets an exceptional need of the school
program;
Subject matter experience in an area of exceptional need;
Breadth of credentials and certificates possessed in areas of need;
Advanced degrees;
Total years teaching; and
All other factors deemed equal, by lot.

a.

b.
c.
d.
e.
f.

5.

Resolution No. 10.69 also approved the exercise of judgment of the District

Superintendent, or designee, in applying the criteria set forth above.

1 Notices were also sent to James Achilles, Terri Dawn Arnold, and Paula Rogers. None of
these employees submitted a Request for Hearing or a Notice of Defense. Since no Requests
for Hearing or Notices of Defense were submitted, this is tantamount to a default proceeding
against these employees and will proceed accordingly.

2

6.

On or about March 10, 2011, Dr. Ramos, in his official capacity, sent out

precautionary notices that services will not be required for the 2011-2012 school year, along
with Resolution Nos. 10.68 and 10.69, copies of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955,
and the Request for Hearing form to five certificated employees, including Eric Valencia and
Theron Hopkins (respondents). On March 15, 2011, the District received Requests for
Hearing from respondents. On March 28, 2011, a Notice of Defense was filed on behalf of
respondents. On March 31, 2011, Accusations, copies of Resolution Nos. 10.68 and 10.69,
Notices of Defense, and Notices of Hearing were served upon respondents.

7.

Respondents are currently certificated employees of the District. Each

respondent was properly and timely served with a preliminary layoff notice and timely
requested a hearing. Each was also properly and timely served with the Accusation, copy of
Resolution Nos. 10.68 and 10.69, Notice of Defense, and Notice of Hearing and had filed on
their behalf a timely Notice of Defense.

8.

Respondent Valencia holds a Clear Single Subject Teaching Credential in the

subject he is authorized to teach, Spanish. Respondent began teaching for the District on
August 9, 2002, and currently teaches three periods of Spanish and two periods of Skills for
Living. Each period equals two-tenths of a Full Time Equivalent (FTE) position.

9.

Respondent Valencia has also taught the State Requirements class in the past,
which he believes a less senior teacher will be teaching next year. He also believes that if he
is laid off, the district will only have one Spanish teacher to serve all the students in the
district, which is comprised of approximately 650 to 700 students.

10.

Dr. Ramos stated that respondent Valencia was given a layoff notice because

of the need to reduce 1.0 FTE in Spanish. Dr. Ramos explained that the District has gone
from three FTEs to two FTEs in Spanish. Dr. Ramos explained that even though some
middle school students are coming to the high school for Spanish and geometry courses, the
enrollment for Spanish classes continues to drop. After the layoff, there will only be one
teacher left to teach Spanish who he believes can absorb respondent’s classes.

11.

Respondent Hopkins holds a Clear Single Subject Teaching Credential and is
authorized to teach English. He also holds a Clear Crosscultural, Language and Academic
Development Certificate. This certificate, when held in conjunction with a prerequisite
credential or permit specified in Education Code section 44253.3 authorizes respondent to
provide specific services to limited-English-proficient pupils. Respondent also holds a
Certificate of Completion of Staff Development (Registration only/not a CTC-document.)
This authorizes respondent to teach specially designed Academic Instruction in English.

12.

Respondent Hopkins began teaching for the District on September 8, 2005.
Respondent teaches English to approximately 115 students and he believes that less senior
teachers are being retained over him. Respondent received training in the Advancement Via
Individual Determination (AVID) in 1993, which is a national program for students, but has
not had any refresher training in AVID. He does not have a certificate for this training.

3

13.

Dr. Ramos explained that there will be five English teachers if respondent
Hopkins is laid off. These five English teachers will absorb respondent Hopkins classes.

Inverse Bumping

14.

Respondents contend that the more senior employees such as Patricia Agles

and Susan Kirby, should be reassigned in order to save the more junior employees from
layoffs. Ms. Agles and Ms. Kirby’s information is as follows:

15.

Dr. Ramos explained that Patricia Agles was in fact, reassigned because of the

need to reduce counseling services. Ms. Agles has a seniority date of September 1969, is
more senior than respondent Hopkins and has taught English in the past. It was determined
that Ms. Agles would be assigned to teach English and ACE English for the 2011-2012
school year and could best serve the district in this capacity. Dr. Ramos explained that Ms.
Kirby is the physical education teacher and is needed to teach physical education full time at
the Community Day School.

16.

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b) provides that whenever a

particular kind of service is to be reduced or discontinued the governing body, not later than
the beginning of the following school year may terminate the services of certificated
employees of the district at the close of the school year and subdivision (c) provides that the
governing board shall make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that employees
shall be retained to render any service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to
render. (Emphasis added.)

17.

The District has discretion as to whether additional assignments and

reassignments should be made to save other junior teachers consistent with their
qualifications. Its obligation to make assignments and reassignments under Education Code
section 44955, however, is “limited to attempting to place an employee who would otherwise
be terminated in a position being held by another employee with less seniority.” (Duax v.
Kern Community College District (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 555, 568.) The District is
therefore not obligated to reassign senior teachers who are not losing their positions in an
effort to save junior teachers. To the extent respondents are seeking “inverse bumping”, this
was not contemplated or required by the process in which the District exercised its discretion
in making assignments and reassignments.

Dr. Ramos explained that Casey Mara was trained last year in the
Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program and had two sections of AVID.
AVID is a national program that requires training in order to be able to serve as an instructor.
No credential is required, but training is necessary and anyone who is trained can teach the
course. Dr. Ramos explained that the program needs to meet the national standards and
certification for the program can be revoked. He explained that Wheatland’s certification
was pulled in the past and they only regained the certification for the program this past year.
Julie Winkel also taught AVID, but has a Clear Single Subject credential in Science:
Geosciences: CLAD. She was assigned to teach AVID and Earth Science and has been
assigned to teach both courses again in the 2011-2012 school year. Neither respondent,
however, has a credential in Science or Geosciences or Social Sciences. Further, Dr. Ramos
noted respondent Hopkins was trained in AVID 18 years ago and has not had any refresher
training.

20.

Dr. Ramos explained that Cylas Olsen has been assigned to teach World

History and Student Government for the 2011-2012 school year and that a Social Science
credential was required to teach the Student Government course. Neither respondent has a
Social Science credential.

7

21. Melissa Taylor has a Clear Specialist Instruction in Agriculture; Clear Single
Subject in Agriculture; and a Clear Single Subject in Biological Science; and CLAD. She is
assigned to teach Biological Science; Agricultural Construction; Construction Arts; and ACE
Science in the 2011-2012 school year. Neither respondent has a Biological Science
credential.

22.

Dr. Ramos explained that with respect to Ms. Landau and Ms. Freeman, both

were junior to respondent Hopkins, but both have special education credentials that allow
them to teach support English, which is a special education class. Neither respondent has a
special education credential which would allow them to bump into these positions. He also
explained the circumstances with respect to Paula Rogers, who is a probationary employee
and was given a precautionary notice. Ms. Rogers has a seniority date of January 3, 2011
and has a Preliminary Multiple Subject CLAD, Supplemental: English, Physical Education
and Intro Social Science credential. Ms. Rogers teaches all subjects and is the only
Community Day teacher. He stated respondents do not have the requisite credentials to
enable them to bump into the Community Day teacher position.

23.

Both respondents, however, agree that no one is being retained that has less

seniority or is otherwise not competent.

24.

Thus, the junior teachers with less seniority possess credentials in subjects that

respondents do not have and are assigned to courses for the 2011-2012 school year that
respondents are not qualified to teach. The District’s decision to retain these less junior
teachers with the appropriate credentials over respondents in order to serve the needs of the
students was proper.

New Seniority List Not Prejudicial to Respondents

25.

On March 22, 2011, the District provided to respondents a document entitled

“Modified Seniority List, Certificated Layoff 2011-2012.” This document was updated as of
April 25, 2011, and provided to respondents at the hearing. This document is the seniority
list and lists the 2010-2011 assignments as well as the 2011-2012 assignments. The only
difference between the March document and the April document is with respect to Patricia
Agles, in which the 0.4 ACE English course is assigned to her for the 2011-2012 year; Casey
Mara, in which the State Requirements assignment is no longer assigned to him for the 2011-
2012 year and in its place is an “AVID” course; and Melissa Taylor, in which the State
Requirements assignment is no longer assigned to her for the 2011-2012 year and in its place
is a Bio-Science course.

26.

Respondents contend that their case was prejudiced by the production of a new
seniority list dated April 25, 2011, at the hearing. The preparation of their case was based on
the seniority list provided to them earlier, rather than the list provided on April 25, 2011. In
particular, they claim the course entitled “State Requirements” was a course assignment on
the prior seniority list and has now been eliminated from the new list. Both argue they can

8

teach the State Requirements course. As a result, they claim their defense was prejudiced by
the production of the updated seniority list.

27.

Respondents, however, suffered no actual prejudice. The seniority list

provided to respondents at the hearing did not change the seniority status of the teachers
listed. The seniority list merely showed changes in assignments for the 2011-2012 year. The
document provided in March shows Mr. Mara was assigned to teach U.S. History and State
Requirements for the 2011-2012 school year and Ms. Taylor was assigned to teach State
Requirements; Agricultural Construction; Construction Arts; and ACE. Both Mr. Mara and
Ms. Taylor have less seniority than respondents. Unlike respondents, however, Mr. Mara
holds a Clear Single Subject Social Science Credential and Ms. Taylor holds a Clear
Specialist Instruction – Agriculture credential; a Clear Single Subject – Agriculture
Credential; and a Clear Single Subject – Biological Science credential.

28.

The only changes cited by respondents on the April seniority list were the fact

that the State Requirements course was eliminated from the assignments for 2011-2012 for
both Mr. Mara and Ms. Taylor. Mr. Mara is still assigned to teach U.S. History and the
AVID course replaced the State Requirements course. With respect to Ms. Taylor, the
Biological Science course replaced the State Requirements course. Neither respondent
Valencia nor Hopkins holds the requisite credentials to teach U.S. History or Biological
Science; Agricultural Construction; Construction Arts; or ACE-Science.

29.

The fact that the State Requirements course is not on the list of assignments

for the 2011-2012 year did not preclude respondents from arguing the fact that they can teach
that course. Indeed, Dr. Ramos testified that three courses of State Requirements will be
taught but he does not know who will be teaching those courses. Thus, there was no actual
prejudice suffered by respondents.

30.

Dr. Ramos described the State Requirements course as a one semester course

that teaches study skills and health. He stated the course could be taught by anyone with a
credential and stated that respondent Valencia taught the course before. Dr. Ramos
explained that because of the way in which the master schedule is developed, the State
Requirements course cannot be assigned to one teacher because several of these courses
could be offered at the same time. It is considered to be a “singleton” in scheduling parlance
and singletons are placed wherever they fit on the master schedule. The State Requirements
course is required by the District and Dr. Ramos does not know who will be teaching the
course next year. He believes there will be three sections of the State Requirements course.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

The District employees receiving notices that their services would not be

required next year have rendered valuable services to the District.

All of the notice and jurisdictional requirements set forth in Education Code

sections 44949 and 44955 were met. (Findings 4, 5, and 6.) The notices sent to respondents
indicated the statutory basis for the reduction of services and, therefore, were sufficiently
detailed to provide them due process. (San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144
Cal.App.3d 627; Santa Clara Federation of Teachers v. Governing Board (1981) 116
Cal.App.3d 831.) The description of services to be reduced, both in the Board Resolution
and in the notices, adequately describe particular kinds of services. (Zalac v. Ferndale USD
(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838.).

3.

Respondents claim the District’s layoff is improper, unlawful and the need for

the layoffs has not been proven. They claim they should be allowed to bump into positions
assigned to less senior teachers. Respondents, however, do not have the specific credentials
that would allow them to bump into these positions. (Findings 8, 11, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22
and 23.) As previously noted, Education Code section 44955 subdivision (c) provides that
the governing board shall make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that
employees shall be retained to render any service which their seniority and qualifications
entitle them to render. (Emphasis added.)

4.

The Board may reduce, discontinue or eliminate a particular kind of service

and then provide the needed services to the students in another manner. (Gallup v. Board of
Trustees (1996) 41 Cal.App. 4th 1571; California Teachers Association v. Board of Trustees
of Goletea Union School Dist. (1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 32.) A school board may reduce
services within the meaning of the statute either by determining that a certain type of service
shall not be performed at all or by reducing the number of district employees who perform
such services. (Rutherford v.Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976)
64 Cal.App.3d 167.)

The services identified in the Resolution are particular kinds of services that may be
reduced or discontinued under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. (Findings 2 and
3.) The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the identified services was neither
arbitrary nor capricious and was a proper exercise of its discretion. Cause for reduction or
discontinuance of services relates solely to the welfare of the school and the pupils in the
District within the meaning of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.

5.

The District is under no obligation to cobble together portions of classes to

create a teaching position for respondents.2 There is no obligation on the part of the District

2 Respondents cite to OAH Case No. N2007030785 for the proposition that they should be
allowed to bump into portions of a FTE that already exist where they are competent as the
junior employee being retained to teach the assignment in the upcoming year. This case is

10

to combine the State Requirements courses, the Skills for Living courses and the AVID
courses for respondents. Further, there is no basis to establish the teachers assigned to those
courses next year should be laid off. (Findings 8, 11, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23.)
Respondents do not have the requisite credentials to bump Ms. Winkel, Mr. Mara, Mr. Olsen
or Ms. Taylor and the District is under no obligation to create positions for respondents.

RECOMMENDATION

Notice shall be given to respondents that their services will not be required for the
2010-2012 school year because of the reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of
services.

Dated: May 4, 2011

inapplicable to the instant case because respondents seek to bump into full-time slots for
which they are not competent to teach or, in the alternative, they seek to have the district
create a slot consisting of State Requirements courses and AVID courses in order to allow
them to retain their positions. As previously stated, the District has the discretion in making
assignments and reassignments and is not required to make the reassignments sought by
respondent into other positions.
