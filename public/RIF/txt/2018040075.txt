to California Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, of the district’s intent not to 
re-employ them for the upcoming school year.  On the same day, respondents were 
served with copies of SMUSD resolution number 44-17/18, blank Notices of

first day of paid service of each respondent.  Respondents were ranked for layoff in 
the inverse order of their date of employment and the tie-breaking criteria, set forth in

dates of employment.

1. 

The services listed in Factual Finding 1 are a PKS within the meaning

Code sections 44949 and 44955.  All notices and other requirements arising out of 
those statutes were provided as required.

Based on the Factual Findings, considered in their entirety, cause exists 
to reduce the number of certified employees of the district by 22.0 FTE1 positions, for 
budgetary reasons.  The SMUSD’s decision to reduce or discontinue the identified 
services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and was a proper exercise of its 
discretion.
