3(b).  On March 10, 2010, the Board adopted a resolution (Resolution 10-15a), 

which added 1.0 FTE Preschool Special Day Class Teacher to the list of particular kinds of 
services to be reduced or discontinued.  This brought the total FTE reduction to 63.70 FTE.   

4. 

The Board further determined that the reduction in services necessitated a 

decrease in the number of certificated employees at the close of the 2009-2010 school year 
by a corresponding number of FTE positions, and directed the Superintendent/designee to 
notify the appropriate employees to implement the Board’s determination.  The Board also 
authorized the Superintendent/designee to issue additional notices to afford employees whose 
rights may be affected the opportunity to be heard.  
 

 

5. 

On or before March 1, 2010, the District gave notice to each Respondent of the 
potential elimination of his/her position for the 2010-2011 school year.  On March 15, 2010, 
the District served the Accusation on Respondents who requested a hearing.  

 

6. 

All Respondents served with the Accusation filed requests for hearing and 

Notices of Defense to determine if there was cause for not reemploying them for the 2010-
2011 school year. 3   

7. 

The services set forth in Factual Finding 3 are particular kinds of services 

 
which may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code  section 
44955.  The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the identified particular kinds of 
services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and constituted a proper exercise of discretion.  
 

                                                 

3  All employees served with preliminary notices of layoff timely filed requests for 
hearing, except Tomeika Carter, Leonard Cheung, and Heidi Wilson.  However, Tomeika 
Carter and Heidi Wilson, but not Leonard Cheung, were served with the Accusation.   

4 

8. 

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services was related 

 
solely to the needs and welfare of the District and its pupils.   
 
The Board considered all known attrition, resignations, retirements and 
 
requests for transfer in determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices to be 
delivered to its employees. 
 

9. 

10. 

In Exhibit B to Resolutions 10-15 and 10-15a, the Board established tie-

breaker criteria for determining the relative seniority of certificated employees who first 
rendered paid service on the same date.  According to Exhibit B, the order of termination 
shall be based on the needs of the District and its students in accordance with the following 
points system:  
 

Two (2) points for an earned Doctoral degree. 

[1] 
 

 

 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

e. 

f. 

 

[¶] . . . [¶] 
 
4. 

 

 

Two (2) points for an earned Masters degree.  

One (1) point for each additional current, valid 
credential held (excluding credential used by unit 
member in their 2009-2010 assignment). 

One point (1) for possession of National Board 
certification.    

One-half (1/2) point for each supplemental 
subject matter authorization.   

One-half (1/2) point for possession of BCLAD or 
BCC certification.   

Employees who receive a notice and who share the same date of 
service shall be ranked by point totals.  Low point totals will  
indicate low seniority for that seniority date. . . .   

5. 

If the criteria listed above do not break a tie, the District shall 
hold a lottery prior to April 1, 2010.  Each group of tied 
employees shall have the right to attend the lottery and pick a 
lottery number.  In the absence of the employee, the 
Superintendent or designee will select a lottery number on 
behalf of the employee.  The teachers association shall have a 
representative in attendance at the lottery.   

 

 

5 

6. 

As between tied employees, low lottery numbers will indicate 
low seniority for that seniority date.   

 
The District maintains a Seniority List which contains employees’ seniority 

11. 

 
dates, current assignments, and credential and certificate information. 
 

The District used the Seniority List with seniority dates to develop a proposed 

 
12. 

layoff list of the least senior employees currently assigned in the various services being 
reduced.  The District also considered each teacher’s credentials and certifications.   

 
13(a).  The District used information from the District’s Seniority List to apply the tie 

breaking criteria of Exhibit B to Board Resolutions 10-15 and 10-15a.     

 
13(b).  No Respondent established that the tie breaking criteria were improperly 

applied or that his/her placement on the Seniority List after application of the tie breaking 
criteria was incorrect.    

 
14. 

 

The District determined that nobody less senior than Respondents was being 

retained to render services which Respondents are certificated and competent to render.  

Respondent Lynne Dee Newton – Permanent / Probationary Status 
 

15. 

Respondent Lynne Dee Newton contested her status as a probationary em-
ployee, asserting instead that she should be classified as permanent.  Although she is the 
most senior elementary school teacher among Respondents, her current probationary status 
places her in the first position for layoff.     

 
16(a).  Respondent Newton appeared at the 2009 layoff hearing in OAH Case 
Number 2009030192, after which the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), dismissed the 
Accusation against her based on lack of proper notice.  In the 2009 Proposed Decision, the 
ALJ made the following factual findings, which are set forth verbatim, as follows: 
 

17.     a.    Respondent Lynne Dee Newton is a first-grade teacher. She 
originally worked full-time with the District from 1971 through 1978, 
when she resigned.  Respondent Newton returned to the District on 
August 31, 1999, as a temporary employee.  In the 1999-2000 school 
year, she worked full-time.  Thereafter, from 2000 [-2001 school year] 
through 2008 [- 2009 school year], Respondent Newton worked part-
time in a job share assignment, working at 60 percent of the school 
days.  

 
   b.    The District provided Respondent Newton with a 
temporary contract for the 1999-2000 school year.  The following year, 
2000, Respondent Newton’s contract stated that she was a “certificated 
employee in a regular position.”  It did not indicate that she was a 

6 

temporary employee.  Each year thereafter, including the 2008 school 
year, Respondent Newton’s contracts noted that she was employed in a 
“regular position” or that she was tenured; none indicated that she was 
a temporary employee.  

 
c.    Upon review of her personnel file several days before the 

[2009] hearing, Superintendent Collins realized that the District’s 
classification of Respondent Newton as “tenured” had been a mistake.  
The District concluded that since her re-hire in 1999, Respondent 
Newton had not worked for two complete consecutive years; i.e., at 
least 75 percent of the days in a school year; and thus, she was not 
tenured.  The District believed that Respondent Newton was a 
temporary employee, and as such, she was not entitled to notice of the 
layoff proceeding.  With sincere regret, Superintendent Collins 
informed Respondent Newton, two days prior to the hearing, that she 
would be laid off.  

16(b).  The evidence at the instant hearing corroborated the findings set forth above in 

 
 
Factual Finding 16(a), and those findings are adopted herein.    
 

17. 

The evidence at the instant hearing further established the following:   

 

(a). 

For the 1999-2000 school year, Respondent Newton was first hired under a 

temporary contract teaching third grade at 40 percent.  From October 25, 1999, until the end 
of the 1999-2000 school year, her temporary contract was changed to include a 60 percent, 
newly-open first grade teaching position, thus becoming a full-time (100 percent) temporary 
contract.  Respondent Sandra DeSurra took the remaining 40 percent of the first grade 
teaching position on a temporary contract.  Respondent Newton worked 60 percent of the 
school days for the school years 2000-2001 through 2008-2009. 
 

(b). 

For the 2000-2001 school year, Respondent Newton’s contract stated that she 
was a “certificated employee in a Regular position,” with a handwritten notation of “Prob II” 
at the top of the contract.  For the 2001-2002, 2002-2003 school years, Respondent Newton’s 
contract again stated that she was a “certificated employee in a Regular position.”  This was 
reiterated in her contracts for the 2003-2004 through 2008-2009 school years, with the added 
notation that she was “Tenured.”   
 

(c). 

From the 2000-2001 school year and thereafter, prior to the commencement of 

each school year, the District required that Respondent Newton complete a Request for 
Unpaid Leave of Absence, requesting a 40 percent leave of absence in order to “job share” 
with Respondent Sandra DeSurra.  Respondent Newton was told she had to request a leave of 
absence for the time she did not want to work because she was employed as a regular teacher 
at 100 percent.   
 

7 

(d).  Based on the notations in her contracts, she believed that she was tenured 

beginning at the commencement of the 2001-2002 school year.  Respondent Newton first 
learned that the District did not consider her tenured last year just prior to the 2009 layoff 
hearing.    

 
(e). 

 
19. 

 
20. 

Following the 2009 layoff hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) 

dismissed the Accusation against Respondent Newton based on the inadequate notice given 
to her as a probationary employee.  
 

(f). 

For the 2009-2010 school year, the District offered, and Respondent Newton 

accepted, a Probationary II contract under which she is working 75 percent, in order to obtain 
tenure.   
 

Elementary and English Teachers 
 

18. 

Following the adoption of Resolution 10-15a, the District determined that 
several of the reduced FTEs would be addressed by way of positively assured attrition.  
These included three FTE K-5 Elementary Classroom Teachers and two FTE 9-12 English 
Teachers.  Consequently, the number K-5 Elementary Classroom Teachers to be 
reduced/discontinued was decreased to 15 FTE, and the need to decrease two FTE 9-12 
English Teachers was eliminated.    

 Given the facts set forth in Factual Finding 18, only 15 K-5 Elementary 

Classroom Teachers are subject to elimination of his/her K-5 Elementary Classroom teaching 
position for the 2010-2011 school year.  They include probationary employee, Respondent 
Lynne Dee Newton (#155, seniority date 9/2/1999; see Factual Findings 15, 16 and 17 and 
Legal Conclusions 4 through 14), three permanent employees who received preliminary 
notices of layoff,4 and permanent employees as follows:  Respondents Sharon Socha (#265, 
seniority date 8/28/06), Stacy Wilkins (#264, seniority date 8/28/06; but see Factual Finding 
16, below), Megan Esquer (#263, seniority date 8/28/06), Rachael Rodriguez (#262, seniority 
date 8/28/06), Chloe Hamlow (#253, seniority date 8/21/06), Jeffrey Crowell (#245, seniority 
date 8/29/05), Susan Rubio (#195, seniority date 8/22/02; but see Factual Finding 16, below), 
Teresa Macias (#194, seniority date 8/22/02; but see Factual Finding 16, below), Rochelle 
Brown (#187, seniority date 10/1/01), Jennifer Tubbs (#184, seniority date 8/23/01), and Ann 
Casey (#183, seniority date 8/23/01).  More senior Respondents, including, Kelly 
Montgomery (#182, seniority date 8/23/01), Heather Povinelli (#175, seniority date 8/23/01), 
and Erin Iler (#173, seniority date 8/23/01) should not be issued final notices of layoff.     

Since the need to need to decrease 2 FTE 9-12 English Teachers was 

eliminated, the two 9-12 English Teachers who received preliminary notices of layoff, 
including Respondent Melissa Lazarian (#242, seniority date 8/22/05), should not be issued 
final notices of layoff.    
                                                 

4 Bhavini Bhakta (#254, seniority date 8/21/06), Pamela Gibba (#201, seniority date 
8/22/02) and Edward Gibba (#199, seniority date 8/22/02) did not file requests for hearing.

Bumping of Junior Employees 

 

 
21. 

 Respondent Stacy Wilkins (#264, seniority date 8/28/06) teaches K-5 

Elementary, and is subject to layoff due to reduction in those particular kinds of services.  
However, in addition to her multiple subject credential, Respondent Wilkins holds an 
authorization in Business (K-9), which allows her to “bump” junior employee, Cynthia Hine 
(#302, seniority date 2/15/09), teaching Middle School Computers.  Consequently, the 
Accusation against Respondent Wilkins should be dismissed.      

 
22(a).  Respondent Susan Rubio (#195, seniority date 8/22/02) teaches K-5 
Elementary, and is subject to layoff due to reduction in those particular kinds of services.  
However, in addition to her multiple subject credential (deemed “highly qualified” per the 
California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC)), Respondent Rubio holds an 
authorization in Introductory English (“highly qualified” per CTC), which allows her to 
“bump” junior employee, Respondent Jennifer Maljian (#256, seniority date 8/21/06), 
teaching Middle School English/College Prep.   

 
22(b).  By virtue of her single subject credential in English and her experience 
teaching Middle School English/College Prep (“highly qualified”), Respondent Maljian in 
turn “bumps” junior employee Katie Woodrick (#291, seniority date 8/20/08), teaching 
Alternative Education English.   

 
22(c).  Consequently, the Accusations against Respondents Rubio and Maljian should 

23. 

Respondent Teresa Macias (#194, seniority date 8/22/02) teaches K-5 

be dismissed.      
 
 
Elementary, and is subject to layoff due to reduction in those particular kinds of services.  
However, in addition to her multiple subject credential (deemed “highly qualified” per the 
CTC), Respondent Macias holds an authorization in Introductory English (“highly 
qualified”), which allows her to “bump” junior employee, Respondent Arabelle Aguirre 
(#299, seniority date 8/25/08), teaching Middle School Language Arts.  Consequently, the 
Accusation against Respondent Macias should be dismissed.      

 
24(a).  At the administrative hearing, Respondent Marita McCarthy spoke on behalf 

of teachers assigned to alternative education settings who had received notices of layoff.  She 
pointed out that “highly qualified” includes one’s experience and training at specific grade 
levels, not just their credentials. 

 
24(b).  Pursuant to Respondent McCarthy’s request, official notice was taken of the 
arguments made in the 2009 layoff hearing regarding the special training and experience of 
teachers at the District’s continuation high school.  Factual Finding 12 of the 2009 Proposed 
Decision is forth verbatim as follows:         

 

9 

12.   Respondent Filiberto Lujan is a health science teacher at the 
District’s continuation high school.  He testified on behalf of himself 
and Respondents . . . Annette Frietas . . .  regarding their special 
training and experience.  This includes the Respondents’ “highly 
qualified” status, as defined by 34 C.F.R. § 200.56, under the No Child 
Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001 (Pub.L. No. 107-110 (Jan. 8, 2002) 
115 Stat 1425). The continuation school recently received accreditation 
by the Western Association Schools and Colleges (WASC), which 
provides college education opportunities, including funding and 
admission assistance, to minority students.  The WASC accreditation 
was based in part on the District’s retention of highly qualified 
teachers; if the District does not have highly qualified teachers, it risks 
losing its WASC accreditation.  Although Respondents Lujan, . . . [and] 
Frietas . . . , the District seeks to “skip” them from the layoff order 
because they possess special training and experience, including their 
highly qualified designation.  No employees with higher seniority dates 
possess this qualification, or the same special training and experience.  
The District has demonstrated a specific need to retain Respondents 
Lujan, [and] Frietas  . . . and the employees have the special training 
and experience to provide the needed services.  

 

24(c).  At the current hearing, the District did not seek to skip any junior teachers 

teaching at the alternative settings.  Moreover, although the junior teachers from the 
alternative settings collectively established that they may have specialized experience by way 
of their assignments, no individual Respondent established that he/she should be skipped by 
virtue of his/her individual training or experience.  Additionally, at hearing, the District 
established that the senior Respondents were certificated and competent to render services of 
the junior Respondents, and the junior Respondents did not provide evidence which 
contradicted the competence of the senior Respondents.  Although the senior Respondents 
may be moving from other school sites and may not have identical experience to the junior 
Respondents, the evidence did not establish that this rendered the senior Respondents 
incompetent to provide services for which they are certificated and have been providing 
instruction.       
 
Seniority Dates  
 

25. 

Respondent Megan Esquer (#263, seniority date 8/28/06) challenged the sen-

iority date assigned to her by the District.  Respondent Esquer began working for the District 
under a temporary contract during the 2005-2006 school year.  She was employed under a 
temporary contract for the 2006-2007 school year, and then employed as a Prob II for the 
2007-2008 school year, having received probationary credit for her temporary service in 
2006-2007.  Therefore, the District properly determined the seniority date for Respondent 
Esquer. 
 

10 

26. 

Respondent Stacy Wilkins (#264, seniority date 8/28/06) challenged the 

seniority date assigned to her by the District.  She began working in the District in August 
2004, attending new teacher training.  She then taught under a temporary contract for the 
2004-2005 school year.  She also taught under temporary contracts for the 2005-2006 and 
2006-2007 school years.  She was employed as a Prob II for the 2007-2008 school year, 
having received probationary credit for her temporary service in 2006-2007.  She argued that 
she should have been notified of the 2006 new teacher training so that she could have 
attended that training to move her seniority date back to the first date of the training.  
However, since she had already attended new teacher training in 2004, the 2006 training was 
not mandatory, and she was not entitled to receive credit for the 2006 training.  Therefore, 
the District properly determined the seniority date for Respondent Wilkins. 
  

27.  Although her PKS was not being reduced/discontinued, Respondent Yvonne 

Koskela (#912, seniority date 8/22/02) was issued a precautionary layoff notice, in case a 
more senior teacher subject to layoff asserted that he/she could bump into Respondent 
Koskela’s position as a Program Advisor.  The District anticipated that, if Respondent 
Koskela was bumped, her single subject credential in Science/Biological Sciences, and her 
authorization in Geosciences would allow her, in turn, to bump junior teacher, Ana 
Madariaga (#316, seniority date 8/25/009), teaching Middle School Physical Sciences.  
However, none of the Respondents asserted that he/she could bump Respondent Koskela.  
Consequently, the Accusation against Respondent Koskela should be dismissed.    
 
Temporary Employees  
 

28. 

The District established that Respondents Ilin Magran (whose position is 

primarily categorically funded), Sandra DeSurra (who is covering the 40 percent leave of 
absence for Respondent Newton), Joy Dunn, Theresa Peterson and Tasha Seibert were 
properly classified as temporary employees.  

 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

2. 

1. 

All notice and jurisdictional requirements set forth in Education Code sections 

 
 
44949 and 44955 were met.   
 
 
Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees in the District due 
to the reduction and discontinuation of particular kinds of services.  Cause for the reduction or 
discontinuation of services relates solely to the welfare of the District’s schools and pupils 
within the meaning of Education Code sections 44955.   
 
  
 

 
3(a).   Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), provides, in pertinent part:  

[T]he services of no permanent employee may be terminated . . . while 
any probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, 
is retained to render a service which said permanent employee is 
certificated and competent to render.   

11 

  

 

 

 

 

[¶] . . . [¶] 
 
As between employees who first rendered paid service to the district on 
the same date, the governing board shall determine the order of 
termination solely on the basis of needs of the district and the students 
thereof. 

 
 
3(b).  The language of this statute is clear that a probationary employee, even if more 
senior, cannot be retained to perform a service that a permanent employee is certificated and 
competent to render.   
 

4. 

Education Code section 44915 provides:   

Governing boards of school districts shall classify as probationary 
employees, those persons employed in positions requiring certification 
qualifications for the school year, who have not been classified as 
permanent employees or as substitute employees. 

5. 

Education Code Section 44916 provides, in pertinent part:  

[A]t the time of initial employment during each academic year, each 
new certificated employee of the school district shall receive a written 
statement indicating his employment status and the salary that he is to 
be paid.  If a school district hires a certificated person as a temporary 
employee, the written statement shall clearly indicate the temporary na-
ture of the employment and the length of time for which the person is 
being employed.  If a written statement does not indicate the temporary 
nature of the employment, the certificated employee shall be deemed to 
be a probationary employee of the school district, unless employed with 
permanent status. 

6. 

Failure to provide notice of temporary employment as required by Section 

44916 results in probationary service as a matter of law.  (Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma 
County Union High School Dist. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 926; See also, Vasquez v. Happy 
Valley Union School Dist. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 969, 983; and Bakersfield Elementary 
Teachers Assn. v. Bakersfield City School Dist. (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1279-1281 and 
1299.)  
 
7. 

Education Code section 44918 (substitute or temporary employee deemed 

probationary employee; reemployment rights) provides, in pertinent part: 

 

 (a) Any employee classified as a substitute or temporary employee, 
who serves during one school year for at least 75 percent of the number 
of days the regular schools of the district were maintained in that 

12 

school year and has performed the duties normally required of a 
certificated employee of the school district, shall be deemed to have 
served a complete school year as a probationary employee if employed 
as a probationary employee for the following school year.  (Emphasis 
added.)

9(b). 

In the case at hand, Respondent Newton’s contract for the 2000-2001 school 

year indicated that she was a “certificated employee in a Regular position,” with a 
handwritten notation of “Prob II” at the top. These facts, along with Education Code 44915 
and 44916, establish that Respondent Newton was a probationary employee at the 
commencement of the 2000-2001 school year.  Furthermore, pursuant to Education Code 
section 44918, Respondent Newton should have been given credit for a full year (1999-2000) 
of probationary service, thus making her a Probationary II employee at the commencement 
of the 2000-2001 school year.  Thereafter, Respondent Newton was required to meet 
statutory requirements to obtain permanent status.    

 
9(a).  The District may not waive statutory tenure requirements if a teacher does not 

meet the specifications of Education Code.  (Fleice v. Chualar Union Elementary School 
Dist. (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 886, 890-894.)   

In Fleice, the teacher taught the Spring 1985 semester, and then taught the full 

1985-1986 school year.  The District offered to rehire her for the 1986-87 school year as a 
permanent employee, and she signed a contract reflecting her tenured classification.  
However, in March of 1987, Fleice was notified that her tenure had been erroneously granted 
and that she had been reclassified as a second-year probationary employee.  Fleice served the 
remainder of her second full year, but the District did not elect to retain her for the next 
school year.  (Id. at 888-889.)   

 
9(c).  The Fleice Court held that the District acted beyond its statutory power in 

granting tenure, stating: 

 

[T]enure statutes, like all statutes, reflect a balance of interests.  In 
Turner v. Board of Trustees (1976) 16 Cal.3d 818, 129 Cal.Rptr. 443, 
548 P.2d 1115, the Supreme Court identified the competing interests 
that this State’s tenure statutes have sought to balance. The Court 
wrote: “In considering the student’s need for education, the teacher’s 
need for job security, and the school board’s need for flexibility in 
evaluating and hiring employees who may remain 40 years, the 
Legislature may determine whether a teacher’s vested right shall be 
granted, postponed or denied. [Citation omitted.]  Our school system is 
established not to provide jobs for teachers but rather to educate the 
young.  Establishing a test period for teachers to prove themselves is 
essential to a good education system.” (Turner v. Board of Trustees, 
supra, 16 Cal.3d 818, 825, 129 Cal.Rptr. 443, 548 P.2d 1115.) . . . 

 

13 

[I]f the tenure statute does reflect a legislative decision to “[e]stablish[ ] 
a test period for teachers to prove themselves” (16 Cal.3d at p. 825, 129 
Cal.Rptr. 443, 548 P.2d 1115), school boards must respect that 
decision. . . .   

 
(Id. at 891-892.)   
 
9(d).  The Fleice Court concluded that its holding “that the District acted beyond its 
statutory power in granting tenure leaves no room to apply the estoppel doctrine.”  The Court 
stated that “the common-law doctrine of equitable estoppel does not authorize us to rewrite 
the Education Code,” and reasoned:   

 

To be sure, “ ‘[t]he doctrine of equitable estoppel may be applied 
against the government where justice and right require it.’” ( City of 
Long Beach v. Mansell (1970) 3 Cal.3d 462, 493, 91 Cal.Rptr. 23, 476 
P.2d 423, quoting from U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. State Bd. of Equal. 
(1956) 47 Cal.2d 384, 388-389, 303 P.2d 1034.)  This general 
principle, however, has two important qualifications. The first is “the 
well-established proposition that an estoppel will not be applied against 
the government if to do so would effectively nullify ‘a strong rule of 
policy, adopted for the benefit of the public....’ ” ( City of Long Beach 
v. Mansell, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 493, 91 Cal.Rptr. 23, 476 P.2d 423, 
quoting from County of San Diego v. Cal. Water Etc. Co. (1947) 30 
Cal.2d 817, 829-830, 186 P.2d 124.)  The second qualification is the 
rule that estoppel cannot expand a public agency’s powers. Thus, 
principles of estoppel are not invoked to contravene statutes and 
constitutional provisions that define an agency’s powers. [Citations 
omitted.] 

 

Both qualifications apply here. The tenure statute, as already discussed, 
limits the District’s powers by establishing a mandatory two-year 
probationary period. The probationary period itself serves the strong 
policy articulated in Turner: “[e]stablishing a test period for teachers to 
prove themselves is essential to a good education system.” ( Turner v. 
Board of Trustees, supra, 16 Cal.3d 818, 825, 129 Cal.Rptr. 443, 548 
P.2d 1115, emphasis added.)  

 
(Id. at 893-894.)   
 
10. 
 

Education Code section 44929.1 provides, in pertinent part: 

(b) Every employee of a school district of any type or class having an 
average daily attendance of 250 or more who, after having been 
employed by the district for two complete consecutive school years in a 
position or positions requiring certification qualifications, is reelected 

14 

for the next succeeding school year to a position requiring certification 
qualifications shall, at the commencement of the succeeding school 
year be classified as and become a permanent employee of the district. 
 
The governing board shall notify the employee, on or before March 15 
of the employee’s second complete consecutive school year of 
employment by the district in a position or positions requiring 
certification qualifications, of the decision to reelect or not reelect the 
employee for the next succeeding school year to the position. In the 
event that the governing board does not give notice pursuant to this 
section on or before March 15, the employee shall be deemed reelected 
for the next succeeding school year. 
 
This subdivision shall apply only to probationary employees whose 
probationary period commenced during the 1983-84 fiscal year or any 
fiscal year thereafter. 
 
Education Code section 44908 provides:  

A probationary employee who, in any one school year, has served for at 
least 75 percent of the number of days the regular schools of the district 
in which he is employed are maintained shall be deemed to have served 
a complete school year.  In case of evening schools, 75 percent of the 
number of days the evening schools of the district are in session shall 
be deemed a complete school year. 

11. 

12. 

Education Code section 44975 states:   

No leave of absence when granted to a probationary employee shall be 
construed as a break in the continuity of service required for the 
classification of the employee as permanent. The time during which the 
leave of absence is taken shall not be considered as employment within 
the meaning of Sections 44882 to 44891, inclusive, Sections 44893 to 
44900, inclusive, Sections 44901 to 44906, inclusive, and Sections 
44908 to 44919, inclusive. 

 

 
 
 

 

13(a).  Education Code section 44929.21 is read in conjunction with Education Code 
section 44975.  (Griego v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 515, 517-
521.)   

 
13(b).  In Griego, the teacher taught a complete school year (more than 75 percent of 

the number of days regular school was maintained) in 1989-1990 as a probationary 
employee.  In the 1990-1991 school year, Griego’s second year as a probationary employee, 
she taught slightly less than 75 percent of the days, due to a work-related injury for which 
she was on approved industrial leave of absence.  In the 1991-1992 school year, Griego again 

15 

taught a complete school year as a probationary employee.  In concluding that Griego had 
served “two complete consecutive” years, the Court determined that Griego’s middle year 
with a leave of absence maintained her “continuity of service,” and that her first and third 
years must be treated as “consecutive” within the meaning of section 44929.21.  (Id.)   
 
 
14.  Here, Respondent Newton was employed at 100 percent during the 1999-2000 
school year; this constituted her first complete year of probationary service.  In order to meet 
the requirements of Education Code section 44929.21, Respondent Newton must have been 
employed for another “complete consecutive” year.  The District acted beyond its statutory 
power in designating Respondent Newton as tenured prior to completion of that second 
“complete consecutive” year.  Although Respondent Newton served nine consecutive years 
of employment (2000-2001 through 2008-2009), they did not constitute “complete” years, as 
defined by Education Code section 44908, since she served less than 75 percent.  
Nevertheless, as in Griego, Respondent Newton’s leaves of absence were not construed as a 
break in the continuity of her service.  Consequently, her 75 percent service in the current 
school year (2009-2010) constitutes her second “complete” year within the meaning of 
Education Code section 44929.21.  However, this service comes too late to avoid the current 
layoff based on her probationary status.       
 

15(a).  Respondent Newton contends that the District should be estopped from 

revoking her previously granted tenure because justice requires it and because it will not 
contravene public policy.  Respondent Newton asserts that, by virtue of her ten years of 
service, she has sufficiently met the two-year “test period” for teachers to prove themselves.  
These arguments, while well-principled, cannot overcome the mandates of the Education 
Code and the holdings in Fleice.   

 
15(b).  Despite the unfortunate consequence of the late discovery of its error, the 
District, just as in Fleice, cannot act in contravention to the Education Code by granting 
tenure without satisfaction of the statutory requirements.  Although her nine years of service 
at 60 percent come to a total of 5.40 years of cumulative teaching, there is no statute or case 
law authorizing the District to calculate a teacher’s probationary period in this cumulative 
manner.  Nor is there any authority for the District to consider substantial compliance with 
the statutorily-prescribed “testing period.”  To the contrary, Education Code section 44908 
specifically defines a “complete” year as 75 percent of the days “in any one school year.”  
Consequently, Respondent Newton’s nine years at 60 percent service cannot be counted 
toward satisfaction of her second year of “complete” (i.e. 75 percent) service.       

 
15(d).  As the Fleice Court pointed out, “the common-law doctrine of equitable 
estoppel does not authorize us to rewrite the Education Code.”  (Fleice, supra, at 893-894.)  
As such, the doctrine of equitable estoppel cannot be applied to grant Respondent Newton 
permanent status for purposes of this layoff proceeding.

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), provides, in pertinent part: 

     
 

[W]henever a particular kind of service is to be reduced or discontinued 
not later than the beginning of the following school year . . . , and when 
in the opinion of the governing board of the district it shall have 
become necessary by reason of any of these conditions to decrease the 
number of permanent employees in the district, the governing board 
may terminate the services of not more than a corresponding 
percentage of the certificated employees of the district, permanent as 
well as probationary, at the close of the school year.   

 
 
17.  No certificated employee junior to any Respondent is being retained to 
perform any services which any Respondent is certificated and competent to render.
