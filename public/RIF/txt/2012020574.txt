FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

2.

Craig Wells is the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources for the

District. He made and filed the Accusations against respondents in his official capacity.

On February 28, 2012, the Governing Board of the District (Board) adopted

Resolution No. 11-40, reducing or eliminating particular kinds of services (PKS) no later

1

than the beginning of the 2012-2013 school year (PKS Resolution). The Board further
determined that it is necessary by reason of the reduction of services to decrease the number
of permanent and/or probationary certificated employees at the close of the 2011-2012
school year by a corresponding number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions, and directed
the Superintendent or his designee to proceed accordingly by notifying the appropriate
employees to implement the Board’s determination.

3.

On March 15, 2012, District Superintendent Carl Toliver gave written notice

to the Board of his recommendation that notice be given to certificated employees occupying
143.50 FTE positions, including respondents, pursuant to Education Code section 44949 and
44955, that their services will not be required for the ensuing school year, and stating the
reasons therefor.

4.

On or before March 15, 2012, the District served 132 certificated employees,

including respondents, with a written notice that it had been recommended, pursuant to
Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, that their services would not be required for the
next school year (Notice). Each Notice set forth the reasons for the recommendation.

5.

Requests for hearing were timely filed by 105 certificated employees,

including respondents, pursuant to Education Code section 44949, to determine if there is
cause for not reemploying them for the ensuing school year.

Accusations and notices of hearing were served on all certificated employees

who filed timely requests for hearing, either individually or through their legal counsel.

Notices of defense were timely filed by or on behalf of 101 certificated

employees, including respondents.1

6.

7.

8.

Except as set forth in the stipulations below, any unrepresented certificated
employee (i.e., not listed on Exhibit A) who failed to file a request for hearing or notice of
defense, or who failed to appear at hearing, has waived his or her right to a hearing, and may
be laid off by the District.

9.

Each respondent is presently a certificated probationary or permanent

employee of the District.

10.

The PKS Resolution called for the reduction or elimination of the following

particular kinds of services for the 2012-2013 school year:

1 Two certificated employees, Carol Becker and Michael Hall, withdrew their requests

for hearing on April 11, 2012. The following individuals who were not represented by Mr.
Driscoll filed notices of defense, but did not appear at the hearing: Elisa Galvan, Regina
Gearheard, Sharon Greene, Nathan Haley, Karina Lee, Marvin Muela, Michelle Munoz,
Deanna Neeley, Phuong Nguyen, and Erin Pressler. The matter proceeded as a default as to
those respondents pursuant to Government Code section 11520.

The above-described services are “particular kinds of services” that can be reduced or

discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.

11.

On February 14, 2012, the Board adopted Resolution No. 11-38, which set

forth criteria to be applied to determine the relative seniority of those certificated employees
who first rendered paid probationary service to the District on the same date (Tiebreak

4

Criteria). The Tiebreak Criteria were based upon the Board’s determination of the needs of
the District and its students, as required by Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b).

12.

On February 14, 2012, the Board adopted Resolution No. 11-39, which set

forth the criteria defining “competency” for purposes of Education Code section 44955,2 to
be applied in instances where a senior certificated employee slated for layoff who seeks to
displace a junior certificated employee (Competency Criteria).

13.

The District maintains a seniority list which contains pertinent information

such as employees’ date of first paid service, current assignment, and credentials on file. The
District used the seniority list to develop a proposed layoff list. The District considered
whether senior employees currently assigned in the various services being reduced or
eliminated could displace, or “bump,” more junior employees. Employees with the same
date of hire were identified for layoff according to the needs of the District and its students.

Stipulation Re: Lisa White

The parties stipulated that Ms. White’s seniority date is 09/01/1993.

The parties stipulated that Ms. White will be reassigned as a counselor as a

result of the 2012 layoff. Consequently, the Notice issued to Ms. White is rescinded, and she
shall be retained for the 2012-2013 school year.

Stipulations Re: Changes to Seniority List

16.

The parties stipulated that the District’s seniority list accurately reflects the

seniority dates and status of the following certificated employees: Elizabeth Collette
(07/09/2008, probationary); David Maxwell (09/10/2007, permanent); and Kathleen Litts
(10/23/2008, probationary).

17.

The parties stipulated to changes in the District’s seniority list affecting the

following certificated employees, who remain subject to layoff::

Joan Leone Maury: change from 12/10/2007 to 08/21/2006 (probationary).

Silvia Paniagua: change from 11/14/2011 to 07/27/2010 (probationary).

Jennifer Wheeler: change from 11/28/2011 to 11/15/2011 (probationary).

14.

15.

A.

B.

C.

2 Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part: “the

services of no permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions of this section
while any probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to
render a service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.”

5

18.

The parties stipulated that Beatrice Ressa’s seniority date shall be changed

from 07/25/2007 to 02/20/2007. As a result, she is more senior than the most senior multiple
subject credentialed teacher and, consequently, her Notice is rescinded and she shall be
retained for the 2012-2013 school year.

Stipulations Re: Rescission of Layoff Notices

19.

The District issued precautionary Notices to permanent certificated employees
Heather Fernandes (11/01/2007) and Susan Lockman (07/09/2008), in the event a respondent
asserted a right to bump into their assignments in alternative programs. No respondent
asserted such a right. Therefore, the precautionary Notices are rescinded, and Ms. Fernandez
and Ms. Lockman shall be retained for the 2012-2013 school year.

20.

The District rescinded the Notices issued to the following permanent

certificated employees, who shall be retained for the 2012-2013 school year: Shelese
Douglas (09/02/2008); Jill Harden (10/13/2009); and Hung Nguyen (09/22/2009).

21.

The District rescinded the Notices issued to the following permanent multiple
subject-credentialed teachers, all of whom share the same seniority date (07/25/2007): Kim
Almarez; Tracy Brennan; Matthew Burt; Joanna Cahill; Maria Calderon; Brianna Clegg;
Rebecca De La Cruz; Kathryn Dugo; Betsabe Elizalde; Chekesha Frazier; Aurora Guyton;
Nathan Haley; Erin Knief; Staci Kormen; Karina Lee; Philip McGill; Debbie Mingua;
Michelle Munoz; Rachel Navarrete; Chelsea Nickols; Erin Northcutt; Jennifer Pettitt; Anh
Thu Pham; Aimee Pichford; Shannon Potter; Hollie Rahe; Crystal Rizzuto-Rodriguez;
Kourtney Scott; Stacey Shankel; Maria Stevenson; and Soua Xiong.

22.

The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the particular kinds of services

identified in the PKS Resolution was not arbitrary or capricious, but constituted a proper
exercise of discretion.

23.

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related to the
welfare of the District and its pupils. The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the District as
determined by the Board.

24.

No certificated employee junior to any respondent was retained to perform any

services which any respondent was certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Jurisdiction for the subject proceeding exists pursuant to Education Code

sections 44949 and 44955, and all notices and other requirements of those sections have been
provided as required.

6

2.

Unified School District due to the reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services.
