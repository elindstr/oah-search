FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

William  R.  Chiment  (Chiment)  made  and  filed  Accusation,  dated  March  28, 

2008,  against  Respondents  Cora  Bagley,  Mindy  Bailey,  Jeffrey  Blankman,  Christina 
Cambra-Adamson,  Rebecca  Carter,  Edith  Corbell,  Kelly  Correa,  Michelle  Derksen,  Cynthia 
Gavin,  Keith  Jain,  Robert  Medina,  Jerilyn  Padua,  Amy  Peck,  Danielle  Schelhorse,  Heidi 
Uyloan,  Ella  Whitehead  and  Colin  Young,  and  Precautionary  Respondents  Norma  Lucey  and 
Katherine  Serrano.  Chiment  filed  the  Accusation  in  his  official  capacity  as  Associate 
Superintendent,  Personne!  Support  Services  (Associate  Superintendent),  Poway  Unified 
School  District  (District)  and  designee  of  Donald  A.  Phillips,  Superintendent 
(Superintendent)  of  the  District. 

Respondents  are  certificated  employees  of  the  District. 

2. 

3. 

The  Superintendent  notified  the  Board  of  Education  of  the  Poway  Unified 

Schoo!  District  (Board)  and  Respondents  that  he  recommended  that  notice  be  given  to 
Respondents  that  their  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

On  March  10,  2008,  the  Board  adopted  Resolution  Number  48-2008  that  reduced  or 

eliminated  particular  kinds  of  services  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  and  set  forth  the  criteria 
for  skipping  certain  employees  and  the  tie-breaker  criteria  to  be  used  for  employees  with  the 
same  seniority  date. 

Respondents  were  served  with  a  written  notice of  termination  on  March  14,  2008. 

  

 

  

The  written  notice  of  termination  stated  that  Respondents’  services  would  not  be 
required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  and  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation. 
The  recommendation  that  Respondents  be  terminated  from  employment  was  not  related  to 
competency.  In  addition,  the  notice  advised  Respondents  of  the  right  to  hearing,  that  the 
request  for  hearing  must  be  delivered  to  the  Associate  Superintendent’s  Office  no  later  than 
March  24,  2008,  not  less  than  seven  days  after  the  date  the  notice  of  termination  was  served 
and  that  the  failure  to  request  a  hearing  would  constitute  waiver  of  the  right  to  a  hearing. 

Some  but  not  all  Respondents  filed  a  timely  Request  for  Hearing  and/or  Notice  of 

Defense. 

An  Accusation  was  served  on  Respondents  in  a  timely  manner. 

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  were  satisfied.

There  was  no  appearance  by  or  on  behalf  of  Respondents  Christina  Cambra- 

Adamson,  Rebecca  Carter,  Michelle  Derksen,  Keith  Jain,  Robert  Medina  and/or  Colin 
Young. 

6. 

Respondents  Christina  Cambria-Adamson,  Michelle  Derksen,  Keith  Jain, 

Robert  Medina  and  Colin  Young  filed  a  Request  for  Hearing  but  failed  to  file  a  Notice  of 
Defense,  waiving  the  right  to  a  hearing. 

Respondent  Patricia  George  did  not  file  a  Request  for  Hearing  but  filed  a  late 

Notice  of  Defense.  Respondent  Patricia  George  waived  her  right  to  hearing. 

Respondents  Mindy  Bailey,  Kelly  Correa  and  Danielle  Schelhorse  did  not  file 

a  Notice  of  Defense  in  a  timely  manner.  The  District  requested  a  ruling  that  the  foregoing 
Respondents  had  waived  their  right  to  a  hearing.  Having  considered  the  arguments  of 
counsel,  it  is  determined  that  Respondents  Mindy  Bailey,  Kelly  Correa  and  Danielle 
Schelhorse  waived  their  right  to  hearing. 

Respondent  Amy  Peck  withdrew  her  Notice  of  Defense. 

On  March  10,  2008,  the  Board  adopted  Resolution  Number  48-2008  and  took 

action  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  particular  kinds  of  certificated  services,  listed  on  attached 
Exhibit  “A”,  commencing  in  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  proposed  reductions  total 
185.24  full  time  equivalent  (FTE)  positions. 

11. 

|  The  Associate  Superintendent  was  responsible  for  implementation  of  the 

technical  aspects  of  the  layoff.  The  District  developed  a  seniority  list  that  contained,  among 
other  matters,  each  employee’s  name,  seniority  date,  current  assignment,  credential  (s)  and 
authorization(s). 

 

The  seniority  date  was  based  on  the  first  date  of  paid  service  rendered.'  A  teacher 

hired  as  a  probationary  employee  who  worked  as  a  substitute  or  temporary  employee  for  at 
least  75  percent  of  the  school  days  during  the  previous  year  and  had  performed  the  duties 
normally  required  of  a  certificated  employee  of  the  school  district,  was  deemed  to  have 
served  a  complete  school  year  as  a  probationary  employee  if  employed  as  a  probationary 
employee  for  the  following  school  year.  The  teacher  was  entitled  to  have  that  earlier  year 
counted  as  a  year  of  probationary  service.  The  prior  year  was  “tacked”  on  for  seniority 
purposes,  ?  but  only  one  year  could  be  tacked. 

12. 

Respondents  Jeffrey  Blankman,  Edith  Corbell,  Cynthia  Gavin,  Heidi  Uyloan 

and  Cora  Bagley  each  sought  modification  of  the  seniority  date  on  file  with  the  District  based 
on  a  prior  temporary  contract  or  contracts  that  each  had  with  the  District.  There  was  no 
evidence  that  a  modification  of  the  seniority  date  of  any  Respondent  named  in  this  Factual 
Finding  impacted  whether  the  employee  should  have  received  a  layoff  notice  even  though  it 
may  have  had  an  impact  for  the  purpose  of  re-employment.  This  proceeding  was  not  the 
forum  to  determine  the  proper  seniority  date  for  re-hire. 

13. 

Respondent  Jerilyn  Padua  (Respondent  Padua)  challenged  the  seniority  date 

that  the  District  has  on  file  for  her. 

Respondent  Padua  holds  a  Pupil  Personnel  Services  (PPS)  Credential.  During  2007  — 

2008  school  year,  she  served  as  a  counselor  with  the  District.  The  District  reported  her 
seniority  date  as  September  5,  2006.  Two  of  her  colleagues,  George  Pantano  (Pantano)  and 
Carol  Ochoa  (Ochoa),  had  the  same  seniority  date,  same  credential  and  provided  counselor 
services  during  the  2007  —  2008  school  year. 

According  to  Resolution  Number  48-2008,  the  District  was  required  to  reduce 
counselors’  services  by  8.50  FTEs.  Respondent  Padua,  Pantano  and  Ochoa  were  considered 
for  the  final  2.50  counselors’  services  FTEs.  Because  these  certificated  employees  had  the 
same  seniority  date,  the  District  was  required  to  apply  the  tie-breaker  criteria  adopted  by  the 
Board,  attached  as  Exhibit  “B.”  According  to  the  evidence,  after  application  of  the  District’s 
tie-breaker  criteria,  Pantano  was  ranked  number  one  because,  in  addition  to  his  PPS 
Credential,  he  held  a  Single  Subject  Credential  with  a  Special  Education  Authorization; 
Neither  Respondent  Padua  nor  Ochoa  held  or  have  any  other  credential,  supplemental 
authorization  or  authorization  on  file  with  the  District.  After  application  of  the  District’s  tie- 
breaker  criteria,  Respondent  Padua  and  Ochoa  were  ranked  equally;  therefore  it  was 
necessary  to  break  the  tie  by  lot;  for  purposes  of  layoff,  Respondent  Padua  was  ranked 
number  two  and  Ochoa  number  three.  Pantano  was  retained  for  the  .5  FTE  counseling 
position,  and  he  will  serve  .5  FTE  in  a  special  education  assignment;  Respondent  Padua  and 
Ochoa  received  a  layoff  notice.  Irrespective  of  ranking,  Ochoa  and  Padua  would  receive  a 
layoff  notice.  For  purposes of  re-employment,  Ochoa  has  been  ranked  number  one  and 
Respondent  Padua  number  two.  Respondent  Padua  asserted  that  ranking  should  be  the  same 

' 

Education  Code  section  44845. 

Education  Code  section  44918. 

 

  

  

on  both  the  seniority  and  re-employment  lists.  As  the  ranking  at  issue  is  for  the  purpose  of 
re-employment,  not  layoff,  this  is  not  the  appropriate  forum  to  determine  these  Respondents’ 
ranking  for  purposes  of  re-employment. 

14. 

The  District  used  the  Seniority  List  to  develop  a  proposed  layoff  and 

“bumping”  list  to  determine  the  least  senior  employees  currently  assigned  in  the  various 
services  being  reduced.  The  District  then  determined  whether  the  least  senior  employees 
held  credentials  in  another  area  that  would  entitle  him  or  her  to  “bump” other  junior 
employees.  In  determining  who  would  be  laid  off  for  each  kind  of  service  reduced,  the 
District  counted  the  number  of  reductions  and  determined  the  impact  on  incumbent  staff  in 
inverse  order  of  seniority.  The  District  then  checked  the  credentials  of  affected  individuals 
and  whether  they  could  “bump”  other  employees. 

15. 

In  compliance  with  Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (d)(1),  by 

adoption  of  Resolution  No.  48-2008,  dated  March  11,  2008?,  the  Board  elected  to  skip  and 
retain  all  teachers  who  served  in  the  District’s  dual  language  immersion  program  during  the 
2007-2008  school  year.  Any  and  all  teachers  currently  serving  in  the  dual  language 
immersion  classes  should  be  skipped  and  retained  for  2008-2009  schoo!  year  and  should  not 
receive  a  layoff  notice. 

16. 

Respondent  Cora  Bagley  (Respondent  Bagley)  challenged  her  release  from  her 

position  as  an  administrator  with  the  District’s  Partners  in  Education  program.  She  offered 
no  evidence  regarding  her  seniority  date  and/or  the  credentials  that  she  holds.  However,  she 
acknowledged  that  she  held  the  administrative  position  using  her  administrative credential. 
Education  Code  section  44951  describes  the  procedure  that  the  District  must  follow  in  order 
to  release  an  administrator  from a  position  that  requires  an  administrative  credential;  the 
statute  does  not  entitle  the  administrator  to  a  hearing.  An  administrator  attains  no  tenure  and 
serves  at  the  pleasure  of  the  appointing  power.  (Hentschke  v.  Sink  (1973)  34  Cal.App.3d  19, 
22.) 

Given  the  foregoing,  Respondent  Bagley  had  no  right  to  a  hearing  regarding 
termination  of  her  position  as  a  District  administrator  in  accordance  with  Board  Resolution 
No.  48-2008: 

ai 

- 

Respondent  Bagley  asserted  that  she  holds  a  credential  that  authorizes  her  to  provide 

teaching  services.  However,  she  acknowledged  that,  based  on  her  seniority  date  and 

Resolution  No.  48-2008  provides,  in  pertinent  part: 

“Deviations  from  the  order of  seniority  in  terminating  a  certificated  employee  of  this  district  may  be  made 

and  are  directed  to  be  made  in  accordance  with  Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (d)(1): 

(A)  Teachers  of  dual  language  immersion  classes  constitute  a  special  and  specific  need  in  the  District  and 
shall  be  considered  for  this  purpose  as  personnel  teaching  a  specific  course  of  study  and  employees 
currently  serving  in  dual  language  immersion  classes  shall  be  considered  as  having  special  training  and 
experience  necessary  to  teach  dual  language  immersion  classes  for  purposes  of  Education  Code  section 
44955(d)(1);  such  teachers  shall  not  be  “bumped”  or  displaced  by  more  senior  employees  unless  such 
more  senior  employee  has  previously  served  in  such  classes  in  this  district;  . 

nae 

.

credential,  she  had  no  bumping  rights.  Nevertheless,  Respondent  Bagley  argued  that  the 
statutory  scheme  that  governs  this  layoff  proceeding  violated  her  due  process  rights  in  that 
she  had  inadequate  time  to  retain  an  attorney  to  assist  in  the  retention  of  her  position,  i.e.,  her 
livelihood.  The  District  questioned  whether  Respondent  Bagley’s  argument  was  reasonable 
in  that  the  statutory  scheme  related  to  this  proceeding  has  been  in  place  for  many  years,  and 
numerous  teachers  have  defended  their  rights  under  these  laws.  Both  Respondent  Bagley 
and  the  District  acknowledge  that  the  Administrative  Law  Judge  has  no  authority  to  rule  on 
her  constitutional  objection. 

17. 

Between  the  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  District  on  the 

same  date,  the  Board  determined  their  order  of  termination  solely  on  the  basis  of  needs  of  the 
District  and  the  students.  The  Board  adopted  specific  criteria  and  provided  clear  instructions 
for  implementation  of  the  criteria.  The  order  of  termination  was  based  on  the  needs  of  the 
District  and  its  students.  The  tie-breaker  criteria  were  fairly  applied  to  rank  those  employees 
hired  on  the  same  date. 

18. 

The  services  that  the  District  proposes  to  reduce  were  “particular  kinds  of 

services”  that  can  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section 
44955.  The  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  these  particular  kinds  of  services  was 
not  arbitrary  or  capricious,  but  constituted  a  proper  exercise  of  discretion. 

19. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  relates  to  the 

welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils.  The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of 
services  was  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  as 
determined  by  the  Board. 

20. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  to  any  Respondent  was  retained  to  perform 

any  services  which  any  Respondent  was  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 

44955.  All  notices  and  jurisdictional  requirements  contained  in  these  sections  are  satisfied. 

2. 

A  District  may  reduce  services  within  the  meaning  of  section  44955, 

subdivision  (b),  “either  by  determining  that  a  certain  type  of  service  to  students  shall  not  be 
performed  at  all  by  anyone,  or  it  may  ‘reduce  services’  by  determining  that  proffered 
services  shall  be  reduced  in  extent  because  fewer  employees  are  made  available  to  deal  with 
the  pupils  involved.”  (Rutherford  v.  Board of  Trustees  (1976)  64  Cal.App.3d  167,  178-179.) 

3. 

Cause  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  Poway 
Unified  School  District  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  cause  for 
the  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of  services  is  related  solely  to  the  welfare 
of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof. 

 

  

  

4. 

A  senior  teacher  whose  position  is  discontinued  has  the  right  to  transfer  to  a 

continuing  position  which  he/she  is  certificated  and  competent  to  fill. 
employee  may  displace  or  “bump”  a  junior  employee  who  is  filling  that  position.  (Lacy  v. 
Richmond  Unified  School  District  (1975)  13  Cal.3d  469.) 

In  doing  so,  the  senior 

5. 

Junior  teachers  may  be  given  retention  priority  over  senior  teachers  if  the 

junior  teachers  possess  superior  skills  or  capabilities  which  their  more  senior  counterparts 
lack.  (Poppers  v.  Tamalpais  Union  High  School  District  (1986)  184  Cal.App.3d  399;  Santa 
Clara  Federation  of  Teachers,  Local  2393  v.  Board  of Santa  Clara  Unified  School  District 
(1981)  116  Cal.App.3d  831.) 

6. 

No  employee  with  less  seniority  than  any  Respondent  was  retained  to  render  a 

service  which  any  Respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

ORDER 

1. 

The  Accusation  served  on  any  Respondent  serving  in  the  dual  language 

immersion  program  during  2007  —  2008  school  year  shall  be  dismissed.  These  Respondents 
shall  be  retained  for  the  2008  —  2009  school  year. 

2. 

Except  as  provided  in  Paragraph  one  of  this  Order,  the  Accusations  served  on 
Respondents  are  sustained.  Except  as  provided  in  Paragraph  one  of  this  Order,  notice  shall 
be  given  to  Respondents  before  May  15,  2008  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the 
2008-2009  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of 
services. 

3. 

Notice  shall  be  given  in  inverse  order  of  seniority.
