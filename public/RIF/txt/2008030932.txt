FACTUAL  FINDINGS

On  March  11,  2008,  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Fortuna  Union  High  School 
District  adopted  Resolution  No.  7,  in  which  the  board  resolved  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the 
following  particular  kinds  of  services  at  the  end  of  the  2007-2008  school  year: 

0.20

The  resolution  directed  the  district’s  superintendent,  or  his  designee,  to  initiate 

procedures  to  not  reemploy  the  equivalent  of  18.20  full-time  equivalent  certificated 
employees of the  district  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955. 

2. 

On  March  12,  2008,  District  Superintendent  Dave  Moss  sent  notice  to  23 

certificated  employees  of  his  recommendation  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or 
discontinued  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  notice  was  withdrawn  for  one  employee  on 
March  14,  2008.  Fifteen  of  the  remaining  employees  requested  a  hearing  to  determine  if 
there  was  cause  to  not  re-employ  them.  Prior  to  hearing,  the  district  withdrew  accusations 
against  two  additional  employees,  Jennifer  Garcia  Jauregui  and  Jonathan  Souza.  The 
remaining  respondents  in  this  proceeding  are  Heather  Brown,  Elizabeth  Buchanan,  Michael 
Chatfield,  Amy  Conley-Samuelson,  Gregory  Diaz,  Sara  Dixon,  Kathy  Harrison,  Jennifer 
Hayes,  Rachel  Heavilin,  Bruce  Johnson,  Elizabeth  McHugh,  and  Tara  Nuth. 

3. 

The  parties  stipulated  that  the  district  has  complied  with  all  procedural 

requirements  of  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955. 

4. 

5. 

The  board’s  decision  to  reduce  18.20  full-time  equivalent  positions  was  based 
on  a  combination  of  declining  enrollment  and  an  anticipated  ten  percent  loss  of  revenue  from 
the  State  of  California  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  All  possible  avenues  other  than 
layoffs  were  considered,  but  the  district  was  unable  to  meet  projected  budgetary  reductions 
without  reducing  certificated  staff.  Superintendent  Moss  planned  for  the  worst  case scenario, 
in  order  to  provide  the  board  and  the  district  with  the  most  flexibility  in  staffing  for  the  2008- 
2009  school  year.  The  board  has  yet  to  make  decisions  regarding  continucd  participation  in 
class-size  reduction  and  the  manner  in  which  services  will  be  delivered.  The  number  of 
students  enrolling  the  district  for  the  school  year  is  still  in  flux.  The  district  has  not  made 
class  assignments  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  Nevertheless,  Superintendent  Moss  is 
satisfied  that  the  district  has  retained  a  sufficient  number  of  certificated  staff  to  meet  the 
district's  projected  staffing  needs  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

Teachers  were  given  notices  based  on  seniority.  Although  tie-breaking  criteria 
were  developed,  there  was  no  need  to  apply  the  criteria  in  order  to  determine  seniority  order. 
Respondent  Bruce  Johnson  was  noticed of  a  partial  (.4  FTE)  reduction  in  his  full-time 
Industrial  Technology  position,  and  he  therefore  will  retain  a  .6  FTE  position.  No 
certificated  employee  junior 
perform  services  that  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

   

respondent)  is  a  full-time  Math  teacher.  Heather  Brown  is  a  full-time  Math  and  Science 
teacher.  They  cach  argue  that  the  district  has  not  retained  a  sufficient  number  of  teachers  in 
order  to  meet  the  number  of  sections  that  will  be  required  in  2007-2008  school  year,  based 
on  their  projection  of  enrollment.  Diaz  also  argues  that  increasing  class  sizes  will  cause  the 
district  to  be  in  violation of  building  and  fire  codes. 

Gregory  Ryan  Diaz  is  a  full-time  English  teacher.  Eric  Helms  (who  is  not  a 

in  seniority  to  respondents  is  being  retained  by  the  district  to

The  teachers’  concerns  are,  at  this  time,  speculative.  The  district  believes  it  has 
retained  a  sufficient  number of teachers  in  order  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  district,  based  on  its 
projected  enrollment.  The  enrollment  number,  however,  is  still  in a  state  of  flux.  Many 
additional  decisions  will  need  to  be  made  by  the  board  and  the  district  before  an  accurate 
assessment  of  staffing  needs  can  be  made.  Because  of  the  financial  uncertainties of the 
district.  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  eliminate  services  is  either 
arbitrary  or  capricious.  (Campbell  Elementary  Teachers  Assn.  v.  Abbott  (1978)  76 
Cal.App.3d  796,  808.)

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  is  related  to  the 

welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof.

1. 

Jurisdiction  for  this  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections 

44949  and  44955,  and  all  notices  and  other  requirements  of  those  sections  have  been

Cause  exists  because of the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services  pursuant 

to  Education  Code  section  44955  to  give  notice  to  all  respondents,  except  Bruce  Johnson, 
that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  cause  relates 
solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  its  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code
