FACTUAL FINDINGS

4. 

The services set forth in the Resolution are particular kinds of services 

that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 

44955.  

5. 

Pursuant to Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), when a 

governing board reduces particular kinds of services resulting in a decrease in the 

number of certificated, permanent employees, the services of a permanent employee 

 

3 

may not be terminated if another employee with less seniority is retained to render a 

service that the more senior employee is “certificated and competent to render.”  

6. 

The seniority date of certificated employees is determined in accordance 

with Education Code section 44845, which provides: “Every probationary or permanent 

employee employed after June 30, 1947, shall be deemed to have been employed on 

the date upon which [s]he first rendered paid service in a probationary position.”  

7. 

Prior to March 15, 2020, Superintendent Mucetti provided written 

Notifications of Recommendation that Services May Not Be Required (Preliminary 

Notices) to certain certificated employees of the District, notifying them that their 

“services may not be required for the 2020-2021 school year,” pursuant to Education 

Code sections 44949 and 44955. 

8. 

The parties stipulated that all respondents: (1) were properly and timely 

served with a Preliminary Notice and timely requested a hearing; (2) were properly and 

timely served with a statement to respondent, the statement of reduction in force, 

copies of relevant Education and Government Code sections, a notice of participation 

and a notice of hearing; and (3) timely filed a First Amended Group Notice of 

Participation. All prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.  

Respondent Jennifer Veilleux 

9. 

Prior to hearing, the parties narrowed the scope of the hearing to the 

limited issue of employee seniority involving respondent Jennifer Veilleux. 

10. 

Veilleux is a permanent full-time (1.0 FTE) certificated teacher at the 

District. She has worked as a third grade teacher at Bel Aire Park Elementary School 

 

4 

since August 2015, when she was hired as a temporary employee. Veilleux has a 

multiple subject credential.  

11. 

For the 2015-2016 school year, Veilleux was hired in a temporary position 

as a third grade teacher to “backfill” for a permanent teacher who was on special 

assignment as a reading specialist. Veilleux also worked in the same temporary 

position for the 2016-2017 school year. 

12. 

For the 2017-2018 school year, on May 30, 2017, Veilleux was offered the 

same temporary position as a third grade teacher. However, due to the resignation of 

a permanent teacher at the start of the school year, in August 2017,3 Veilleux was 

offered the third grade teaching position as a probationary level 2 employee.  

13. 

The District’s seniority list reflects that Veilleux has a seniority date of 

August 15, 2016. Her initial date of hire, as a temporary employee with the District, was 

August 21, 2015. She became a probationary employee on August 14, 2017. To 

establish Veilleux’s seniority date of August 15, 2016, the District “tacked” on one year 

of seniority because she met the qualifications of Education Code section 44918, 

subdivision (a), which provides:  

Any employee classified as a substitute or temporary 

employee, who serves during one school year for at least 75 

percent of the number of days the regular schools of the 

district were maintained in that school year and has 

performed the duties normally required of a certificated 

employee of the school district, shall be deemed to have 

                                              

3 The specific date was not established at hearing. 

 

5 

served a complete school year as a probationary employee 

if employed as a probationary employee for the following 

school year. 

14. 

Dana Page, Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, testified at 

hearing. Page explained that seniority is ordinarily established when a teacher attends 

the paid mandatory teacher training/orientation at the beginning of the school year. 

The “new” teacher training/orientation is for certificated employees who are new to 

the District and primarily covers the District’s policies and procedures. The start of the 

new teacher training/orientation is counted as the first day of hire for a teacher for 

seniority purposes. 

Veilleux’s Evidence and Contentions 

15. 

Veilleux described herself as a competent teacher who has taught 

valuable skills to her students over the past five years. She has “built a home” at her 

school, and has “given her all” to her students and the District. She questions why the 

District did not ask her students’ parents about her competency as a teacher. She 

believes that the District did not recognize her outstanding performance. 

16. 

Veilleux has three contentions. First, she contends that 20 other teachers 

were hired at the same time that she was hired in 2015 for a temporary position, and 

they were arbitrarily assigned and randomly scattered throughout the District. She 

asserts that these other 20 teachers were allowed to have their first year of service 

count toward seniority and that their layoff notices were rescinded, and believes that 

she should be treated the same.  

 

6 

At hearing, Page acknowledged Veilleux’s concerns about the appearance of 

arbitrary assignments. Page explained that individual teachers, such as Veilleux, are not 

made aware of the reasoning behind teaching assignments made throughout the 

District. It is not uncommon or unlawful for employees who are hired as temporary 

employees to become junior in seniority to those hired as probationary employees in 

the same year. Here, Veilleux failed to provide evidence to establish that she is entitled 

to a higher seniority date than the other 20 teachers. 

17. 

Veilleux also contends that when she was placed in a probationary 2 

position in her third year of teaching in 2017-2018, the District should have considered 

her second year of teaching in school year 2016-2017 retroactively as a probationary 1 

position, and her seniority date should be August 21, 2015. 

Her second argument is not persuasive. As established above, pursuant to 

Education Code section 44918, Veilleux is only entitled to the maximum one year of 

tacking to her seniority for the year she worked prior to her probationary assignment. 

This places her seniority date as August 15, 2016, as correctly calculated by the District. 

Here, Veilleux failed to provide a legal basis for the District to consider the 2016-2017 

school year, when she worked as a temporary employee, to be retroactively considered 

to be her first year of working as a probationary employee. 

18. 

Veilleux further contends that she should be placed higher on the 

seniority list than 11 other teachers who were hired after her in 2016. These 11 other 

new teachers attended a mandatory teacher training/orientation before the start of 

the 2016-2017 school year. Veilleux was not given the opportunity to attend the 

mandatory training/orientation because she had already been teaching within the 

District. This caused her seniority to be lower than the 11 other teachers. Veilleux seeks 

 

7 

to have her seniority date changed to the same date as the start of the mandatory 

teacher training/orientation that the other 11 teachers attended in early August 2016, 

which was before her current seniority date of August 15, 2016.  

Whether pre-service training days constitute the first date of paid probationary 

service is an important consideration, because seniority establishes the relationship 

among all certificated employees. (Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v. 

Bakersfield City School District (2006) 145 Cal. App. 4th 1260, 1293, fn. 20.)  

In this case, Veilleux did not attend the paid mandatory training/orientation 

which establishes seniority among all certificated employees within the District. At 

hearing, Page explained that because respondent Veilleux was a late hire for the 

2015-2016 school year, she did not attend the mandatory new teacher 

training/orientation in 2015. Additionally, she did not attend the mandatory teacher 

training/orientation prior to the start of the 2016-2017 or the 2017-2018 school years. 

According to Page, it was unlikely that respondent Veilleux would have been offered 

an opportunity to attend the mandatory “new” teacher training/orientation in August 

2017, because she had already been working in the District since 2015.  

Ultimately, respondent Veilleux did not submit sufficient evidence to establish 

that her seniority date with the District should be changed from August 15, 2016. Her 

request for a change to her seniority date must therefore be denied. 

19.  No permanent or probationary certificated employee with less seniority is 

being retained to render a service which respondent Veilleux is certificated and 

competent to render.

20. 

The reduction or discontinuation of the particular kinds of services set 

forth in Resolution No. 20-21 is related to the welfare of the District and the students 

thereof within the meaning of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. The decision 

to reduce or discontinue these services is neither arbitrary nor capricious, but rather a 

proper exercise of discretion of the District. The reduction or discontinuation of 

particular kinds of services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated 

employees, as determined by the Governing Board. 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

The District complied with all notice and jurisdictional requirements set 

forth in sections 44949 and 44955.  

2. 

The services referenced in the Resolution set forth in Factual Finding 2 

are the kind which may be reduced or discontinued in accordance with applicable 

statutes and case law. (See Ed. Code, § 44955; Campbell Elem. Teachers Assn., Inc. v. 

Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796; Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 

167.) The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the services is neither arbitrary nor 

capricious, but rather a proper exercise of the District’s discretion.  

3. 

The evidence established that no certificated employee with less seniority 

than Veilleux is being retained to render services which she is certificated and 

competent to perform. (Factual Findings 16-19.)  

4. 

Veilleux did not establish that her seniority date should be changed 

under Education Code section 44845. (Findings13-14, 16-19.) 

 

9 

5. 

In accordance with Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, cause 

exists for reduction of particular kinds of services of the District, beginning no later 

than the commencement of the 2020-2021 school year, as established in Factual 

Findings 2 through 8. The cause relates solely to the welfare of the District and the 

pupils thereof within the meaning of Education Code section 44949. (Factual Finding 

20.)  

the 2020-2021 school year.  

6. 

Notice may be given to Veilleux that her services will not be required for 

Notice may be given to respondent Jennifer Veilleux that her services will not be 

required for the 2020-2021 school year.
