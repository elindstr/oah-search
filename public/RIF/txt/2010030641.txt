for not reemploying respondents for the ensuing school year.  In the opinion of the 
Governing Board, it will be necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees in 
the District on account of the above reduction or discontinuance of services.  As a 
consequence, the Board has determined that the services of a corresponding number or less 
of the certificated employees of the District shall be terminated at the close of the current 
2009-2010 school year. 
 
 
2010, has further determined that, as between employees who first rendered paid service on 
the same date, the order of termination listed on the seniority list has been based solely on the 
basis of the needs of the District and the students thereof.  One of the subsections of the 
listed criteria was not applied.  However, the Governing Board ratified the application of the

who is one of the performing arts teachers whose position is being eliminated, is bumping 
into Ms. Ayer’s position.  Ms. Wong is senior to Ms. Ayer.  However, there has been an 
additional retirement since March 15, 2010, of a music teacher in the district.  The District 
was not required to take that into account for the March 15, 2010 notices, but is required to 
take it into account for the final layoff notices.  The District is only authorized to reduce 
music by 1.0 FTE.  The vacant position left by the retirement must be filled by the most 
senior teacher qualified to teach in that position. 
 
 
District is only authorized to reduce the multiple subject positions by a specific number.

respondents argued that the District could not meet its mandated services if this reduction is 
implemented.  The District indicated that it could meet its mandated services and presented a

1.0 FTE Psychologist.
