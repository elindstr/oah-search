General Findings Concerning Statutory Requirements

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Education Code sections 44949 and 449554 provide for two notices to be given

in connection with terminating certificated employees. The first notice, which will be
referred to as the Preliminary Layoff Notice, is given by the superintendent. It is given to the
governing board and to the employees the superintendent recommends for layoff. The
Preliminary Layoff Notice gives the board and the employees notice that the superintendent
recommends that those employees be laid off. The superintendent must give the Preliminary
Layoff Notice no later than March 15. There is no requirement that a governing board take
any action in March. But while it is unnecessary, governing boards usually adopt a
resolution ratifying the superintendent’s recommendations.

2.

The second notice is a notice of a governing board’s decision to terminate an
employee. That notice is provided for in Section 44955 and must be given before May 15.
That notice advises a teacher that the district will not require his or her services for the
ensuing school year. That notice will be referred to as a Termination Notice.

3.

In this case, not later than March 15, 2010, the superintendent notified the

governing board and the respondents that he recommended that the respondents not be
retained for the ensuing school year.

The Preliminary Layoff Notice stated the reasons for the recommendation.

The recommendation was not related to respondents’ competency.

A Preliminary Layoff Notice was delivered to each respondent, either by

personal delivery or by depositing the notice in the United States mail, registered, postage
prepaid, and addressed to respondent’s last known address.

4.

5.

6.

The Preliminary Layoff Notice advised each respondent as follows: He or she
had a right to a hearing. In order to obtain a hearing, he or she had to deliver a request for a
hearing in writing to the person sending the notice. The request had to be delivered by a
specified date, which was a date that was not less than seven days after the notice was

4 All references to the Code are to the Education Code unless otherwise specified.

served.5 And the failure to request a hearing would constitute a waiver of the right to a
hearing.

7.

Respondents either timely filed written requests for a hearing or obtained a

waiver of their failure to file. An accusation was timely served on respondents. Respondents
were given notice that, if they were going to request a hearing, they were required to file a
notice of defense within five days after being served with the accusation.6 Respondents
either filed timely notices of defense or obtained a waiver of their failure to file. All
prehearing jurisdictional requirements were either met or waived.

8.

The governing board of the district resolved to reduce or discontinue particular
kinds of services. Within the meaning of Section 44955, the services are “particular kinds of
services” that can be reduced or discontinued. The decision to reduce or discontinue these
services was not arbitrary or capricious but constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

Services the District Intends to Reduce or Discontinue

9.

The governing board of the district determined that, because particular kinds

of services are to be reduced or discontinued, it is necessary to decrease the number of
permanent or probationary employees in the district by 90.0 full time equivalents (FTE).7

10.

The particular kinds of services the governing board of the district resolved to

reduce or discontinue are:8

Services

Number of Full-Time
Equivalent Positions

1. Teacher – Elementary Grades

57.0 FTE

5 Employees must be given at least seven days in which to file a request for a hearing.

Education Code section 44949, subdivision (b), provides that the final date for filing a
request for a hearing “shall not be less than seven days after the date on which the notice is
served upon the employee.”

6 Pursuant to Government Section 11506, a party on whom an accusation is served
must file a notice of defense in order to obtain a hearing. Education Code section 44949,
subdivision (c)(1), provides that, in teacher termination cases, the notice of defense must be
filed within five days after service of the accusation.

7 The board’s original resolution called for the reduction of 116.2 FTE. Complainant,

however, stipulated that the number had been revised and reduced to 90 FTE.

8 A number of the FTEs have been revised and reduced. These FTEs total 90, the

revised total.

Use of Tie-Breaking Criteria Based on the Current Needs of the District and Students

12.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (b), the governing board of the district

adopted criteria for determining the order of termination as among employees who first
rendered paid service on the same day. Section 44955, subdivision (b), requires a district to
adopt such criteria and provides that the criteria are to be based on “needs of the district and
the students . . . .” The district’s tie-breaking criteria are as follows:

The following rating system shall be applied in determining the
order of termination of certificated employees:

Number of teaching and/or special service credentials.

A.
Rating: +1 per credential

Number of supplementary and/or added authorizations.

B.
Rating: +1 per supplementary/ authorization

Earned degrees beyond the BA/BS level. Rating: +1 per

C.
degree

D.

National Board Certification. Rating: +1 per degree

In the event that common day hires have equal qualifications
based on application of the above criteria, the district will then
break ties by utilizing a lottery.

13.

Application of the tie-breaking criteria resulted in determining the order of

termination solely on the basis of needs of the district and the students thereof.

District’s Intention to Deviate from Seniority (Skipping)

14.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), a district may deviate from

terminating employees in the order of seniority, i.e., a district may skip over teachers with a
particular qualification and terminate more senior teachers who do not possess that
qualification. In order to skip, a district must demonstrate a specific need for personnel to
teach a specific course or course of study or for personnel with a specialization in personnel
services or nursing. If the need concerns a course or course of study, the district may skip a
junior employee only if employees with more seniority do not possess the special training
and experience necessary to teach the course and only if the junior employee does possess
that special training and experience.

15.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), the governing board of the
district resolved to deviate from terminating employees in the order of seniority, i.e., the

5

board resolved to skip over teachers with a particular qualification and terminate more senior
teachers who do not possess that qualification. A district may skip a junior employee only if
employees with more seniority do not possess the special training and experience necessary
to teach a specific course or course of study (specific course).

16.

The district identified two courses as creating specific needs for personnel.

The first is the head football coach. The second is high school band director.

17.

The board resolved as follows:

WHEREAS, it will be necessary to retain certificated employees
who possess special training or experience, which other
certificated employees with more seniority do not possess, to
teach a specific course of study:

Demonstrated experience, knowledge and skills as Head

1.
Football Coach of three (3) years or more at a large California
public high school along with a credential which demonstrates
being “Highly Qualified” in a core subject area as contemplated
by the No Child Left Behind Act.

Demonstrated experience, knowledge and skills as High

2.
School Band Director of three (3) or more years at a large
California public high school, along with appropriate
credentials.

18.
director position.

The district elected not to exercise a skip regarding the high school band

19.

The district skipped Thaddeus Mac Neal, the head football coach. Mr. Mac

Neal is the least senior teacher in the district. In addition to serving as the head football
coach, he teaches 0.2 FTE of physical education and 0.8 FTE of English. The district
skipped Mr. Mac Neal because of his combination of coaching duties and teaching duties.
English teachers who are more senior than Mr. Mac Neal object that the district cannot
terminate them while retaining Mr. Mac Neal to teach English.

20.

The senior English teachers are correct. A district may not skip a teacher

because of his or her extracurricular activities such as coaching. Code section 44955,
subdivision (d), allows skipping only with regard to personnel needed “to teach a specific
course or course of study” or with regard to someone “with a specialization in either pupil
personnel services or health for a school nurse.” Skipping is not permitted for an
extracurricular activity such as coaching.

Code section 44955, subdivision (b), provides, in part: “Except as otherwise provided
by statute, the services of no permanent employee may be terminated . . . while any . . . other

6

employee with less seniority is retained to render a service which said permanent employee
is certificated and competent to render.” Code section 44955, subdivision (c), extends theses
protections to probationary employees. In that subdivision, “such employees” refers to the
“permanent as well as probationary” language in subdivision (b). Subdivision (c) provides,
in part, “[S]ervices of such employees shall be terminated in the inverse of the order in which
they were employed.”

21.

The district did not serve Mr. Mac Neal with a Preliminary Layoff Notice.

Thus, the district must retain him for a full 1.0 FTE position. The district does not assert a
need to skip English teachers and does not contend that Mr. Mac Neal has any special
qualifications as an English teacher.

22.

The most senior English teacher who requested a hearing and who wants a 0.8

FTE position must be retained for that position. With regard to that teacher, the accusation
must be modified to provide for a right to a 0.8 FTE position.

Right to be Retained According to Seniority and Qualifications – Date of Hire

23.

Job security is not inherent in seniority. The Legislature chose to provide

teachers with limited job security according to their seniority.

24.

Katherine M. Dendy contends that her seniority date is earlier than August 25,
2006, which is the date the district has assigned to her. In 2006, August 25, was the first day
of school for teachers. Ms. Dendy, however, is a counselor. She testified that, as a
counselor, she began work at least five days before the teachers began working. Torrie
Norton, the assistant superintendant for personnel, testified that counselors do work
additional days but only at the end of the school year – not at the beginning.

25.

The following is a paraphrased summary of part of Ms. Dendy’s testimony: As

a counselor, I work days in addition to the regular school year. I work approximately 10
additional days, and they are not all at the end of the year. In 2006, I worked at the high
school. I started at least five days before the regular school year. I reviewed transcripts and
worked during school registration, which was the week prior to the regular school year. I
recall that year.

26. Ms. Dendy’s testimony on this point was very convincing. She proved that

her seniority date is August 18, 2006, or earlier.

27.

Susan Penrod is a social science teacher with a seniority date of August 25,

2006. As noted above, the district is reducing social science teaching services by 4.8 FTEs.
Ms. Penrod was subject to layoff. She, however, is qualified to serve as a counselor. If she
were more senior than Ms. Dendy, she would have a right to bump into Ms. Dendy’s position
as a counselor. The district, based on its records showing that both Ms. Dendy and Ms.
Penrod had the seniority date August 25, 2006, applied tie breaking criteria to determine who

7

should be deemed to be more senior. Ms. Penrod prevailed in the tie breaking, and the
district concluded that she could bump into Ms. Dendy’s position.

28.

As found above, however, Ms. Dendy’s seniority date is August 18, 2006. She

is senior to Ms. Penrod. There was no tie to be broken. Ms. Penrod has no right to bump
into Ms. Dendy’s position. As to Ms. Dendy, the accusation must be dismissed.

Right to be Retained According to Seniority and Qualifications – (Bumping)

29.

The second paragraph of section 44955, subdivision (c), does not add to

teachers’ seniority rights. It does, however, make it clear that governing boards must make
assignments in such a way as to protect seniority rights. Employees must be retained to
render any service their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render. Thus, if a senior
teacher whose regular assignment is being eliminated is certificated and competent to teach a
junior teacher’s courses, the district must retain the senior teacher and reassign him or her to
render that service. This is commonly referred to as bumping. The district must either
reassign or terminate the junior employee.

30.

As noted above in footnote number 8, the district revised the number of FTEs

it is seeking to reduce concerning a number of the particular kinds of services. One
reduction concerned science teachers. The district originally sought to reduce that service by
8 FTE. The district, however, revised that number to 3.6 FTE. Valerie Park, with a seniority
date of August 25, 2003, is a science teacher who, according to the district’s calculations,
occupies a position senior to science teachers who comprise 5.6 FTEs. That is, beginning
with the most junior position, she occupies position number 5.7 through 6.6. As such, at the
time the district was seeking to lay off 8 FTE science teachers, Ms. Park was subject to
termination. Because she is qualified to serve as a counselor, the district determined that she
could bump into the counseling position held by Enrique Gonzalez, who has a seniority date
of August 24, 2009. At the time the district was seeking to reduce the science teacher
services by 8 FTE, that was correct.

31.

After the district revised the reduction in science teachers to 3.6, however, Ms.

Park no longer was subject to termination and, therefore, no longer had a right to bump into
anyone’s position. The district, nevertheless, treated Mr. Gonzalez as having been bumped
and sent him a Preliminary Layoff Notice. After the reduction was revised to 3.6, Ms. Park
could not bump into Mr. Gonzalez’s position, and the district may not terminate Mr.
Gonzalez. As to Mr. Gonzalez, the accusation must be dismissed.

32.

As noted above world language teacher services are being reduced by 6.0 FTE.

Maria G. Blake, who has a seniority date of August 27, 2004, teaches Spanish and was
subject to layoff. She is qualified as an English language development (ELD) teacher and
asserts a right to bump into a position held by Elisa S. Ayala, who has a seniority date of
August 21, 2008. Ms. Ayala is an ELD resource teacher. She has worked as an ELD teacher
in the past. As a resource teacher, she does not have a classroom. Rather, she coaches and
assists classroom ELD teachers. Ms. Ayala placed in evidence a job description for an ELD

8

resource specialist. This job description was developed under the auspices of the district’s
former director of curriculum and instruction. There was no evidence that the district has
officially adopted it. Ms. Ayala also placed in evidence a document entitled “English
Learner Program Recommendations for 2011-12.” That document is marked “Draft.” Ms.
Ayala contends that these documents show that the district failed to prove that Ms. Blake is
competent to bump into Ms. Ayala’s position.

33. Ms. Norton, the assistant superintendant for personnel, testified that the
competency requirement for both an ELD teacher and an ELD resource teacher is a bilingual,
crosscultural, language, and academic development (BCLAD) certificate.

34.

Code section 44955, subdivision (c) provides, in part: “The governing board

shall make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that employees shall be retained
to render any service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render.” (Italics
added.) The right to be reassigned is commonly referred to as a right to bump into another
position. It is reasonable to interpret “qualifications” by referring back to the language of
subdivision (b): “a service which said . . . employee is certificated and competent to render.”
(Italics added.)

35.

A school district has substantial discretion in establishing competency

standards. Here the district did not abuse that discretion by treating a BCLAD certificate as
being sufficient to establish competency to serve as an ELD resource teacher.

Mandated Services

36.

State and federal laws mandate that certain services be provided at or above
mandated levels. There was no evidence that the district is reducing those services below
mandated levels.

Summary of Findings Regarding Retention of Employees

37.

The most senior English teacher who requested a hearing and who wants a 0.8

FTE position must be retained for that position. With regard to that teacher, the accusation
must be modified to provide for a right to a 0.8 FTE position.

38.

39.

As to Ms. Dendy, the accusation must be dismissed.

As to Mr. Gonzalez, the accusation must be dismissed.

40. With regard to respondents who are permanent employees, the district is not

retaining any probationary employee to render a service that such a respondent is certificated
and competent to render.

9

41. With regard to respondents who are permanent employees, the district is not

retaining any employee with less seniority than such a respondent has to render a service that
the respondent is certificated and competent to render.9

42. With regard to respondents who are either permanent or probationary
employees, the district is not retaining any employee with less seniority than such a
respondent has to render a service that the respondent’s qualifications entitle him or her to
render. 10

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

General Conclusions

1.

2.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Sections 44949 and 44955. All notice

and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied.

Within the terms of Sections 44949 and 44955, the district has cause to reduce

or discontinue particular kinds of services and to give Termination Notices to certain
respondents. The cause relates solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils.

Conclusion Regarding the District’s Election to Skip Mr. Mac Neal

3.

By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 19 through 22, it is determined

that the most senior English teacher who requested a hearing and who wants a 0.8 FTE
position must be retained for that position. With regard to that teacher, the accusation must
be modified to provide for a right to a 0.8 FTE position. Code section 44955, subdivision
(b), prohibits the district from terminating a senior English teacher while retaining Mr. Mac
Neal to perform a service the senior teacher is certificated and competent to render.

Conclusions Regarding Ms. Dendy

4.

By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 24 through 28, it is determined
that Ms. Dendy’s seniority date is August 18, 2006. Thus, Ms. Penrod, with a seniority date
of August 25, 2006, has no right to bump into Ms. Dendy’s position.

9 Section 44955, subdivision (b), provides seniority protection for a permanent

employee in terms of the services the employee is “certificated and competent to render.”
(Italics added.)

10 Section 44955, subdivision (c), provides seniority protection for both permanent
and probationary employees in terms of the services an employee’s “qualifications entitle
[him or her] to render.” (Italics added.)

10

Conclusions Regarding Mr. Gonzalez

5.

By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 30 and 31, it is determined that,

after the reduction in science teacher services was revised to 3.6, Ms. Park no longer was
subject to layoff and, therefore, has no right to bump into Mr. Gonzalez’s position.

Cause Exists to Terminate Certain Respondents

6.

Cause does not exist to terminate the following employees: The respondents
identified in Finding 11, the most senior English teacher who requested a hearing and who
wants a 0.8 FTE position, Ms. Dendy, and Mr. Gonzalez.

7.

With those exceptions, cause exists to give notice to the respondents that their

services will not be required for the ensuing school year.
