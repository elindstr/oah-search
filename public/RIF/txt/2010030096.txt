Diana Mendez, Alicia Morales, and Shirley Yang were not present at the hearing.  
 
 
The  District  decided  to  reduce  or  discontinue  certain  educational  services  and  gave 
Respondents and other certificated employees of the District notice of its intent not to reemploy 
them  for  the  2010-2011  school  year.  Respondents  requested  a  hearing  for  a  determination  of 
whether cause exists for not reemploying them for the 2010-2011 school year. 
 
Oral  and  documentary  evidence,  and  evidence  by  oral  stipulation  on  the  record,  was 
 
received at the hearing. The record was left open until April 19, 2010, to provide District with an 
opportunity to produce a document  or documents it was directed, over objection, to produce. 
The document or documents referenced during the testimony of District witness Robert J. Arias, 
Ed.D.  (Arias),  District  Assistant  Superintendent,  Human  Resources,  contained  possible 
calculations that tied the decline in average daily attendance to the number of teachers being laid

off  in  certain  categories.  Counsel  for  Respondents  was  given  until  April  20,  2010,  following 
review of any documents produced, to notify District whether it intended to raise any additional 
issues in this case. If additional issues were raised, the parties were given until April 23, 2010 to 
submit written closing arguments.  
 
 
On April 19, 2010, District submitted written argument, four pages in length, re-asserting 
their objections to the document production, which is marked as District’s exhibit number 12 for 
identification  only.  On  April  20,  2010,  Respondents  submitted  a  request,  which  is  marked  as 
Respondents’  exhibit  A,  for  identification  only,  to  present  briefing  on  an  issue.1  On  April  23, 
2010,  counsel  for  Respondents  submitted  written  argument  entitled  “Certain  of  Respondents’ 
Closing  Hearing  Brief,”  six  pages  in  length,  which  is  marked  as  Respondents’  exhibit  B,  for 
identification  only.  District  did  not  submit  further  argument  on  the  issue.  District’s  relevancy 
objection to the document production, for the reasons set forth in this decision, is sustained.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On  February  23,  2010,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  (Governing  Board) 
adopted a Resolution, reducing or discontinuing the following services for the 2010-2011 school 
year: 
 
 
 
 
Elementary Classroom Teaching

The services set forth in factual finding number 3 are particular kinds of services 
 
which may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.3 
The  parties  stipulated,  at  the  outset  of  the  hearing,  that  District  was  not  being  challenged  in 
describing  its  actions  as  a  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  under 
section 44955, subdivision (b). 
 
 
The  Governing  Board  took  action  to  reduce  the  services  set  forth  in  factual 
finding  number  3  primarily  because  of  anticipated  declines  in  State  funding.  The  decision  to 
reduce the above-described particular kinds of services was based on a fiscal solvency problem 
created  by  the  current  state  budget  crisis,  as  well  as  financial  problems  caused  by  declining 
enrollment this past school year and an anticipated reduction in projected enrollment next school 
year.  The  District  is  facing  an  estimated  $14.0  million  deficit,  a  lawsuit  that  could  affect  its 
student enrollment, and declining enrollment in the District. The District’s declining enrollment 
is only one of several factors that contribute to the District’s fiscal deficit. The decision to reduce 
or discontinue the particular kinds of services is neither arbitrary nor capricious but is rather a 
proper exercise of the District's discretion. 
                
The reduction or discontinuance of services set forth in factual finding number 3, 
 
in  the  context  of  the  significant  anticipated  decline in revenue, is related to the welfare of the 
District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated 
employees  as  determined  by  the  Governing  Board.  The  reduction  or  elimination  of  the  FTE 
positions will not reduce services below mandated levels. 
 
 
14.  On  February  23,  2010,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  adopted  criteria  to 
determine  the  relative  seniority  of  certificated  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  in  a 
probationary position on the same date (tie-breaking criteria). The criteria are reasonable as they 
relate to the skills and qualifications of certificated employees, and the District properly applied 
the criteria. 
 
 
Respondent  Cindy  Yuri  Kim  (Kim)  is  an  elementary  classroom  teacher 
(1.0 FTE) currently assigned to teach second grade. She disputes her seniority date of August 28, 
2006.  She  was  first  employed  by  District  during  the  2005-2006  school  year  as  a  substitute 
teacher to replace absent regular employees. In October 2005, District offered Kim a long term 
assignment to substitute for a second grade teacher who was ill. Kim replaced the teacher on an 
on-call  status  on  October  20,  2005  and  November  3,  2005.  Kim  also  replaced  other  absent 
teachers  during  the  time  period  between  October  20,  2005  and  November  23,  2005.  On 
November  28,  2005,  Kim  began  the  long  term  assignment  to  teach  in  the  classroom  of  the 
teacher  who  had  been  ill  on  October  20  and  November  3.  Kim  performed  the  duties  of  this 
second  grade  teacher  from  November  28,  2005  continuously  to  the  end  of  the  school  year  on 
June  16,  2006.  Kim  worked  a  total  of  158  days  as  a  substitute  teacher  during  the  2005-2006

school year, which contained 180 instructional days. She served in the long term assignment for 
124 days of the school year, which corresponds to approximately 69 percent of the school year. 
Kim  was  hired  by  District  as  a  probationary  employee  for  the  2006-2007  and  the  2007-2008 
school years. She was given a contract as a tenured employee during the 2008-2009 school year. 
  
 
 
Respondent  Kim  asserts  that  she  should  be  retained  by  District  because 
her seniority date should be the beginning of the 2005-2006 school year by virtue of application 
of Education Code section 44918, subdivision (a), which states:  “Any employee classified as a 
substitute or temporary employee, who serves during one school year for at least 75 percent of 
the number of days the regular schools of the district were maintained in that school year and has 
performed the duties normally required of a certificated employee of the school district, shall be 
deemed  to  have  served  a  complete  school  year  as  a  probationary  employee  if  employed  as  a 
probationary employee for the following school year.” District points out that subdivision (d) of 
section 44918 provides an exception when the employee provides substitute service on an on-
call basis. Respondent Kim did not teach in the long term assignment for more than 75 percent of 
the school year before she became a probationary employee. Her substitute service on an on-call 
status to replace absent regular employees on a day-to-day basis between September 20, 2005 
and  November  23,  2005  does  not  apply  to  the  calculation  of  the  75  percent  requirement. 
Respondent Kim’s seniority date was therefore correctly determined to be August 28, 2006. (Ed. 
Code, § 44918). 
 
 
Respondent Sylvia Poe (Poe) is also an elementary classroom teacher (1.0 FTE) 
currently  assigned  to  teach  second  grade.    She  also  disputes  her  seniority  date  of  August  28, 
2006.  Poe was first employed by the District during the 2005-2006 school year as a temporary 
teacher. She acknowledges that she signed a temporary contract for the 2005-2006 school year, 
and took the place of a teacher who had taken the year off. Poe returned to teach for the District 
during the 2006-2007 school year. Poe believed she signed, in September 2006, a probationary 
contract for the 2006-2007 school year. At hearing, District produced a written contract showing 
that  Poe  had  agreed  to  serve  as  a  temporary  teacher  for  the  2006-2007  school  year,  stating:  
“Your temporary services for the 2006-07 school year will begin on 08/28/2006 and end June 
30, 2007.”  Poe did not produce a written probationary contract to refute the District’s evidence. 
Poe  was  hired  by  District  as  a  probationary  employee  for  the  2007-2008  school  year  and  has 
since continued to teach for the District without a break in service.  
 
 
The  parties  stipulated  that  the  seniority  date  for  Respondent  Patricia  Chinchilla 
(Chinchilla) is August 28, 2006. The parties further stipulated that the seniority list would be re-
ordered as a result of the corrected seniority date. In applying the tie-breaking criteria, Chinchilla 
is credited with three points.       
 
 
Respondent David Meng (Meng) has a seniority date of December 1, 2008. He is 
tenured.  He  was  hired  by  the  District  as  a  high  school  biology  teacher  during  the  2008-2009

school year. For the 2009-2010 school year, the District assigned Meng to a position teaching 
high school Earth Science. Biology is a life science course. Earth Science is a physical science 
course.  Meng  testified,  without  dispute  from  the  District,  that  he  was  incorrectly  classified  as 
teaching  high  school  biology  for  the  2009-2010  school  year,  instead  of  being  classified  as  an 
Earth Science teacher. District’s exhibit number 11, which provides a list of all of the certificated 
science teachers for the District, supports Meng’s testimony that he was incorrectly classified as 
a biology teacher. District’s exhibit number 11, however, also showed that, even if the District 
mistakenly classified Meng’s teaching assignment, Meng is the least senior high school science 
teacher within the District and that he could therefore be bumped from his assignment by more 
senior science teachers, who held credentials that would allow them to displace Meng from his 
position. 
  
 
Respondents  Catherine  Blackler  (Blackler)  and  Aida  Sandavol  (Sandavol)  were 
employed by the District as classified employees before they became certificated. Respondents 
Blackler and Sandavol seek credit for the years they were employed as classified employees in

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

2. 

Jurisdiction  for  the  subject  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  sections  44949  and 

 
 
44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 9. 
 
 
The  party  asserting  a  claim  or  making  charges  in  an  administrative  hearing 
generally  has  the  burden  of  proof.  (Brown  v.  City  of  Los  Angeles  (2002)  102  Cal.App.4th 
155.) For example, in administrative hearings dealing with personnel matters, the burden of 
proof is ordinarily on the agency prosecuting the charges (Parker v. City of Fountain Valley 
(1981) 127 Cal.App.3d 99, 113); in personnel matters concerning the dismissal of a teacher 
for  cause,  the  burden  of  proof  is  similarly  on  the  discharging  school  district  (Gardner  v. 
Commission on Prof. Competence (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 1035). As no other law or statute 
requires otherwise, the standard of proof in this case requires proof to a preponderance of the 
evidence. (Evid. Code, § 115.) In this case, the District has the burden of establishing by a 
preponderance  of  the  evidence  cause  to  give  final  layoff  notices  to  certificated  employees 
given notice of this proceeding. 
 
 
within the meaning of section 44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 3 and 11.

discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  set forth in factual finding number 3, which cause

In this case, the District met its burden of establishing by a preponderance of 

Respondents contend the District’s layoff decision pertaining to its reduction 

relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District's  schools  and  pupils,  by  reason  of  factual  finding 
numbers 1 through 20.  
 
 
of classroom teachers is invalid because the District abused its discretion by failing to 
calculate the “corresponding percentage” of certificated employees in proportion to the 
decline in “average daily attendance” of students. The record establishes that part of the 
decision-making included the anticipated reduced revenue from declining enrollment but that 
the District did not undertake the process for laying off certificated employees based on a 
reduction in average daily attendance provided for in Education Code section 44955. As 
stated in San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 638-639, the 
reduction of particular kinds of services on the basis of financial considerations is authorized 
under Education Code section 44955, and, “in fact, when adverse financial circumstances 
dictate a reduction in certificated staff, section 44955 is the only statutory authority available 
to school districts to effectuate that reduction.” Such a decision may be overruled if proven to 
be arbitrary or capricious, but a motivation to maintain flexibility in light of financial 
uncertainty is neither. Campbell Elementary Teachers Association, Inc. v. Abbott (1978) 76 
Cal.App.3d 796, 808.) 
 
 
the evidence that it proposes the reduction of particular kinds of services pursuant to 
Education Code section 44955, as set forth in factual finding numbers 11, 12, and 13. The 
parties stipulated at the outset of the hearing that there would be no challenge to the District’s 
decision to proceed on this basis. The instant layoff decision was caused by overall budget 
concerns and not a simple reduction in average daily attendance (ADA). Thus, the reason for 
the layoff, i.e. the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services, was correctly 
stated in the pertinent notices. There is nothing in Education Code section 44955 prohibiting 
an expected decline in student attendance from being one factor of many in the overall 
decision to reduce or eliminate particular kinds of services. A calculation of the 
“corresponding percentage” of certificated employees in proportion to the decline in “average 
daily attendance” is not required or relevant in order to proceed under this alternative. The 
District’s actions were not arbitrary or capricious. The District did not abuse its discretion. 
 
 
provided responsive documentation to Respondents regarding the basis for its “particular 
kind of service” layoff. Respondents did not bring a motion to compel, and none of the 
discovery requests or responses were submitted in the record of this proceeding. Given that 
the District proceeded with the reduction of its force as a result of the reduction or 
discontinuation of particular kinds of services, and that the parties stipulated there would be 
no challenges on this basis, documentation pertaining to ADA would not be relevant.

The Education Code (Code) permits certificated employees to be classified in one 
 
of  four  ways:  permanent,  probationary,  substitute,  or  temporary.  (Kavanaugh  v.  West  Sonoma 
County  Union  High  School  District  (2003)  29  Cal.4th  911,  916  (Kavanaugh).)  A  certificated 
employee is classified as permanent, i.e., acquires tenure, if, after having been employed for two 
complete successive school years in a position requiring certification qualifications, he or she is 
reelected  for  the  following  year.  (§  44929.21,  subd.  (b);  Bakersfield  Elementary  Teachers 
Association  v.  Bakersfield  City  School  District  (2006)  145  Cal.App.4th  1260,  1278-1279 
(Bakersfield).)  Probationary  employees  are  “those  persons  employed  in  positions  requiring 
certification  qualifications  for  the  school  year,  who  have  not  been  classified  as  permanent 
employees  or  as  substitute  employees.”  (§  44915.)  “[S]ection  44915  has  been  understood  to 
make  probationary  status  the  default  classification  for  certificated  employees  who  are  not 
otherwise  required  by  the  Code  to  be  classified  as  permanent,  substitute,  or  temporary 
employees. [Citations].” (Bakersfield, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at p. 1281.) Substitutes are “those 
persons employed in positions requiring certification qualifications, to fill positions of regularly 
employed persons absent from service. . . .” (§ 44917.) Temporary employees are those requiring 
certification  qualifications,  other  than  substitute  employees,  who  are  employed  for  limited 
assignments,  as  defined  in  the  Code,  such  as  in  sections  44918,  44919,  44920,  and  44921. 
(California Teachers Association v. Vallejo City Unified School District (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 
135, 146 (Vallejo).)  
 
 
Employment as a substitute or other temporary status may become employment in 
a probationary capacity in some circumstances. “A year of employment as a temporary teacher 
may,  in  some  cases,  be  treated  as  a  year  of  probationary  service  for  purposes  of  attaining 
permanent status if the employee is rehired for the following year ‘as a probationary employee in 
a position requiring certification qualifications’ (§ 44909); ‘in a position requiring certification 
qualifications’  (§  44917);  ‘as  a  probationary  employee’  (§  44918);  or  ‘in  a  vacant  position 
requiring certification qualifications’ (§ 44920). . . .” (Bakersfield, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at p. 
1279, fn 11.)  
 
 
Section 44918, subdivision (a), provides: “Any employee classified as a substitute 
or temporary employee, who serves during one school year for at least 75 percent of the number 
of days the regular schools of the district were maintained in that school year and has performed 
the duties normally required of a certificated employee of the school district, shall be deemed to 
have served a complete school year as a probationary employee if employed as a probationary 
employee for the following year.” Section 44918, subdivision (d), provides an exception to the 
rule, as follows:  “Those employees classified as substitutes, and who are employed to serve in 
an on-call status to replace absent regular employees on a day-to-day basis shall not be entitled 
to the benefits of this section.” 
 
 
In  the  case  of  Respondent  Cindy  Yuri  Kim,  she  did  not  teach  more  than  75 
percent  of  the  2005-2006  school  year  in  a  long  term  assignment  before  she  became  a 
probationary  employee.  She  is  therefore  not  entitled  to  receive  probationary  employee  credit

under  section  44918  for  the  year  preceding  her  employment  as  a  probationary  employee.  (§ 
44918, subd. (d).) Respondent Kim’s seniority date was correctly determined to be August 28, 
2006, as set forth in factual finding number 15.   
 
 
In the case of Respondent Sylvia Poe, the District established that she was serving 
as  a  temporary  employee  for  both  the  2005-2006  school  year  and  the  2006-2007  school  year. 
She signed written contracts, which informed her in writing of her temporary status. Respondent 
Poe  was  hired  as  a  probationary  employee  during  the  2007-2008  school  year  and  given  a 
seniority date, pursuant to section 44918, subdivision (a), of August 28, 2006, which provided 
seniority  credit  to  Poe  for  the  preceding  year  of  temporary  employment.  Respondent  Poe’s 
seniority  date  was  correctly  determined  to  be  August  28,  2006,  as  set  forth  in  factual  finding 
number 16.   
 
 
Section 44955, subdivision (c) provides, in pertinent part: “[t]he governing board 
shall make assignments and reassignments in such manner that employees shall be retained to 
render any service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render.”  The statute, in 
subdivision (b), gives preference to employees who are permanent or have seniority: “Except as 
otherwise provided by statute, the services of no permanent employee may be terminated under 
the provisions of this section while any probationary employee, or any other employee with less 
seniority,  is  retained  to  render  a  service  which  said  permanent  employee  is  certificated  and 
competent to render.”  
 
 
Sections  44949  and  44955  set  forth  the  process  through  which  certificated 
employees may be laid off following reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services. 
The  statutes  embody  a  legislative  choice  for  seniority-based  layoffs,  subject  to  specific 
limitations set forth in the statutes. 
 
 
In the case of Respondent David Meng, whether he was assigned a position as a 
life science or a physical science teacher, he was the least senior teacher on a long list of high 
school  science  teachers,  who  were  both  certificated  and  competent  to  render  his  services. 
Respondent Meng, as the least senior science teacher, would be displaced from his position, as 
set forth in factual finding number 18. 
 
 
The seniority date of a certificated employee is defined as the date the employee 
“first rendered paid service in a probationary capacity.” (§ 44845.) Since Respondents Catherine 
Blackler and Aida Sandoval worked in undisputed classified positions prior to their first date of 
paid  service  in  a  probationary  capacity,  none  of  this  experience  constitutes  “probationary” 
employment in a certificated capacity and may not be credited toward seniority.  
 
 
forth in factual finding number 17. 
 

Respondent Patricia Chinchilla’s proper seniority date is August 28, 2006, as set
