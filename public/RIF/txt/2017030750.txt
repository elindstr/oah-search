4. 

On  March  13  and  14,  2017,  the  District  provided  notice  to  Respondents  that  their 
services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2017-2018  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of  particular 
kinds  of  services. 
Respondents  thereafter  timely  requested  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is 
cause  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  2017-2018  school  year. 

5. 

On  March  22,  2017,  Associate  Superintendent  McKinney  issued  the  Statement 

of  Reduction  in  Force  and  served  it  and  other  required  documents  on  Respondents. 

6. 

The  parties  stipulated  that  Respondents  timely  filed  a  Notices  of  Participation  in 
the  Reduction  in  Force  Hearing,  requesting  a  hearing  and  challenging  the  decision  of  the 
District  not  to  reemploy  them  for  the  2017-2018  school  year.

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met.

The  Resolution  contains  the  tie-breaking  criteria. 

In  order  of  importance,  the 
Governing  Board  designated  the  following  criteria:  credential  status  in  the  area  of  current 
assignment;  possession  of  a  clear  or  preliminary  authorization  to  teach  English  Language 
Learners;  the  number  of  verified  contract  years  of  certificated  employment  experience  with  the 
District;  the  breadth  of  clear  and  preliminary  credentials  and  authorizations;  possession  of  a 
clear  or  preliminary  credential  of  authorization  to  teach  or  serve  in  special  education  with 
moderate  to  severe  authorization,  special  education  with  mild  to  moderate  and  moderate  to

Science,  Fine  Arts,  and  Spanish;  and  the  number  of  verified  years  of  certificated  employee 
experience  as  determined  by  actual  step  placement  on  the  District’s  certificated  salary  schedule. 
Any  ties  remaining  after  the  application  of  the  criteria  were  to  be  resolved  by  random  selection.

Displacement  of Less  Junior  Certificated  Employees 

14. 

Barquin  testified  about  the  assignments  and  reassignments  made  by  the  District 
to  permit  certificated  employees  to  displace  less  senior  employees.  The  District  did  not  always 
have  the  senior  employee  displace  the  most  junior  employee  serving  in  an  assignment  in  which 
the  more  senior  employee  was  certificated.  The  District  sought  to  move  the  senior  employee 
into  an  assignment  the  teacher  was  also  competent  to  perform.  In  making  its  determination  of 
competency  and  reassignment,  the  District  looked  to  whether  the  senior  teacher  had  taught  the 
course  or  performed  the  assignment  before.  The  senior  employee  had  to  be  able  to  perform  the 
entire  assignment  of  the  junior  employee,  not  just  a  portion,  in  order  for  the  displacement  to 
take  place. 

15. 

Respondents  argued  that  the  following  individuals  should  not  be  laid  off  because 
the  District  failed  to  have  the  senior  employee  displace  the  much  junior  employee:  Timothy 
Fredericksen,  David  Gutierrez,  Ana  Harvey,  Tiffany  Pham,  Alexandra  Pineda,  Robin  Post,

Skipping  of Junior  Employees 

16. 

The  District  skipped  certain  junior  employees  on  the  basis  of  specialized  training 
and  experience  and  actual  assignment  in 
the  following  programs  or  services:  Advanced 
Placement  (AP)  classes,  Advanced  Via  Individual  Determination  (AVID)  classes,  Art  teachers,

The  latter  course  allows  teachers  to  implement  AVID  concepts  in  their  classrooms.  In  order  to

Respondents  did  not  dispute  the  District’s  needs  in  these  areas,  but  some  of  them 
argued  that  they  possessed  the  training  and  experience  to  fulfill  the  requirements  of  the  position 
that  more  junior  employees  had  been  retained  to  perform.

The  literacy  coach  and  the  teacher  effectiveness  coach  positions  were 
chosen  through  a  selection  process  that  included  interviewing  for  the  position.  Incumbents  in 
the  former  provide  remediation  to  students  and  those  in  the  latter  provide  peer  assistance  to 
other  teachers.  Respondent  Chapman  has  never  served  in  either  position,  and  her  department 
chair  duties  did  not  involve  classroom  or  peer  coaching  or  demonstration  of  lesson  plans,  which 
constitute  an  integral  part  of  the  duties  of  the  literacy  coach  and  the  teacher  effectiveness  coach 
jobs.  Accordingly,  Respondent  Chapman  did  not  establish  that  she  is  competent  to  displace  the 
junior  employees  working  as  literacy  coaches  or  teacher  effectiveness  coaches.

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  for  the  subject  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  sections  44949  and 

44955,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  1  through  7. 

2. 

The  services  listed  in  factual  finding  number  3  are  particular  kinds  of  services 

within  the  meaning  of  section  44955,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  3  and  8. 

3. 

Cause  exists  under  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  District  to  reduce  or 
discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number  3,  which  cause 
relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District's  schools  and  pupils,  by  reason  of  factual  finding 
numbers  1  through  10. 

4. 

Section  44955,  subdivision  (b),  provides,  in  pertinent  part:  “[t]he  services  of  no 
permanent  employee  may  be  terminated  under  the  provisions  of  this  section  while  any 
probationary  employee,  or  any  other  employee  with  less  seniority,  is  retained  to  render  a  service 
which  said  permanent  employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render.”  (Emphasis  added.) 
“Certificated”  is  defined  by  the  provisions  of  the  Education  Code  pertaining  to  credentials. 
in  terms  of  the

Section  44955,  subdivision  (c),  provides,  in  pertinent  part:  “[t]he  governing 
board  shall  make  assignments  and  reassignments  in  such  manner  that  employees  shall  be 
retained  to  render  any  service  which  their  seniority  and  qualifications  entitle  them  to  render.” 
Respondents  argue  that  the  District  did  not  follow  the  statutory  requirements  because  in  some 
instances  involving  reassignments  of  TOSAs  and  administrators  it  failed  to  have  the  impacted 
senior  certificated  employees  displace  the  most  junior  employee  who  could  have  been 
displaced.  However,  the  fact  that  the  District  could  have  made  assignments  and  reassignments 
in  a  different  manner  does  not  render  the  assignments  that  were  made  arbitrary  or  capricious. 
Respondents  did  not  establish  that  any  of  the  assignments  or  reassignments  made  by  the 
District,  which  are  required  by  section  44955,  subdivision  (c),  constituted  an  abuse  of  discretion 
or  that  they  otherwise  violated  the  requirements  of  sections  44949  or  44955. 

6. 

A  district  is  permitted  to  deviate  from  laying  off  certificated  employees  in  order 
of  seniority  if  “[t]he  district  demonstrates  a  specific  need  for  personnel  to  teach  a  specific 
course  or  course  of  study,  or  to  provide  services  authorized  by  a  services  credential  with  a 
specialization  in  either  pupil  personnel  services  or  health  for  a  school  nurse,  and  that  the 
certificated  employee  has  special  training  and  experience  necessary  to  teach  that  course  of  study

(§  44955, 
or  to  provide  those  services,  which  others  with  more  seniority  do  not  possess.  ..  .” 
subd.  (d)(1).)  As  set  forth  in  factual  finding  numbers  16  through  18,  the  District  skipped  junior 
employees  in  five  areas  because  of  its  asserted  special  needs  for  these  services. 

In  Bledsoe  v.  Biggs  Unified  School  District  (2009)  170  Cal.App.4th  127  (Bledsoe),  a 
district  was  able  to  skip  two  junior  employees  because  of  the  district’s  demonstrated  need  for 
teachers  with  experience  in  instruction  in 
a  community  day  school.  The  junior  teachers 
possessed  special  training  and  experience  that  enabled  them  to  meet  the  district’s  specialized 
needs  for  alternative  education.  They  had  taken  courses  in  many  subjects  that  covered  areas  of 
instruction,  had  training  in  areas  related  to  working  with  difficult  students,  and  had  actual 
experience  in  dealing  with  the  community  day  school  students.  The  court  concluded  that  even 
though  the  respondent  in  that  case  possessed  the  basic  qualifications  to  teach  in  the  community 
day  school,  he  lacked  the  additional  special  training  and  experience  required  for  the  position. 

The  District  has  demonstrated  a  specific  need  for  personnel  to  teach  AP,  AVID  and  IB 
classes,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  16  through  18,  and  the  skipped  individuals  have 
the  special  training  and  experience  necessary  to  teach  the  courses  of  study  and  to  provide  the 
services  which  the  Respondents  set  forth  in  Exhibit  1  with  more  seniority  do  not  possess.
