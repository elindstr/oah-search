Respondent Walker’s Auto Mechanics position will be taken by Michael

Vincent Cortese, an employee whose regular position as a Truck Mechanics CCOC teacher is
being discontinued as a result of the elimination of particular kinds of services. Although
Cortese has not previously taught Auto Mechanics, he is certificated and competent to render
Walker’s duties, and has greater seniority than Walker. Walker is therefore subject to layoff.

6.

Respondent Henson’s Multimedia CCOC position is being discontinued as a

result of the elimination of particular kinds of services. Henson is subject to layoff.
He is the least senior teacher in the District. He moved his family from Fresno to San Jose
last year so that he could take his job with the District. He had no indication at the time that
the position would be eliminated after the school year. The elimination of his position has
caused Henson personal, familial, and financial distress.

7.

The District will not retain any probationary employee or any other

certificated employee with less seniority than respondents during the 2011-2012 school year
to render a service for which they are certificated and competent to perform.
