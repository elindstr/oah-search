PROPOSED DECISION

This matter was heard before Administrative Law Judge Jonathan Lew, State of

California, Office of Administrative Hearings, on April 29, 2011, in Placerville, California.

James Scot Yarnell, Attorney at Law, represented the Mother Lode Union School

District (District).

Ballinger G. Kemp, Attorney at Law, represented respondent certificated employees.

Evidence was received in the form of documents and testimony. The case was

submitted for decision on April 29, 2011.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

2.

Tim Smith is the Superintendent of the District. The actions of Mr. Smith in

making and filing the Accusation were taken in his official capacity.

Mr. Smith noted in his March 9, 2011 notice of proposed layoffs to District

employees that the District’s action was prompted by uncertainty over District financing
related to State cuts in education funding for the 2011/2012 school year. The Superintendent
has recommended that certain District programs and services be reduced and/or eliminated to
address the anticipated budget deficit.

1

3.

On March 9, 2011, the Superintendent recommended to the Board that

particular kinds of services being offered by the District be discontinued or reduced. The
Superintendent stated the reasons for the recommendation. The Board approved the
recommendations and, following the adoption of the Resolution set forth below, directed the
Superintendent or designee to implement the recommendations. The Board also charged the
Superintendent and his staff to identify an equivalent number of certificated personnel and
give those certificated employees notice in writing of the Superintendent’s recommendation
that their services would not be required for the ensuing school year. The recommendation
of certificated personnel to be identified for layoff from employment with the District was
not related to their skills or performance as teachers.

4.

In response to the Superintendent’s recommendation above, the Board adopted

Resolution No. 2011-03-09.2 on March 9, 2011. The Board resolved that the District needs
to reduce or eliminate particular kinds of services as recommended by the Superintendent
and, accordingly, it was resolved that it is necessary to terminate the employment of an
equivalent number of certificated employees of the District due to the reductions. Resolution
No. 2011-03-09.2 authorized the Superintendent, or designee, to take action to reduce or
discontinue the following particular kinds of services for the 2011/2012 school year:

Particular Kind of Service (PKS)

Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)

Multiple Subject Services

Special Education Services

Counseling

TOTAL

5.5

2.0

1.0

8.5 FTE

The proposed reductions total 8.5 FTE, with an equivalent number of certificated

positions.

5.

The services set forth in Resolution No. 2011-03-09.2 are “particular kinds of
services” that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section
44955. There was no evidence that the Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue these
particular kinds of services was arbitrary or capricious. The reduction or elimination of the
particular kinds of services set forth in Resolution No. 2011-03-09.2 constituted a proper
exercise of the Board’s discretion, within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.

6.

On March 9, 2011, the District personally served written preliminary notice

that advised permanent and probationary certificated employees, pursuant to Education Code
sections 44949 and 44955, that their services would not be required for the next school year.
The preliminary notices were served on nine certificated permanent and/or probationary
employees of the District. Each written notice set forth the reasons for the recommendation
and noted that the Board had adopted Resolution No. 2011-03-09.2, which was attached to

2

the preliminary notice. All nine certificated employees served a preliminary notice timely
requested in writing a hearing to determine if there is cause for not reemploying them for the
ensuing school year.1

7.

The Superintendent made and filed Accusations against each of the certificated

employees of the District who timely requested a hearing after receipt of the preliminary
notice or double notice. It was not disputed that the Accusations, with required
accompanying documents and blank Notices of Defense, as well as Notices of Hearing, were
timely served on the responding employees.

8.

Notices of defense were filed by, or on behalf of nine District employees.

Jurisdiction for the subject proceeding exists pursuant to Education Code sections

44949 and 44955.

Tie-Break Criteria

9.

Kerry Rabusin and respondents Tammy Comer and Elizabeth Hawkins have
the same District seniority date, August 10, 2005. Resolution No. 2011-03-09.2, paragraph
5, provided the following with regard to District employees with the same seniority date:

That as between employees who first rendered paid service on the same date,
the order of termination shall be based solely on the needs of the District and
the students thereof, as determined by the point system described herein. This
system shall be applied only where the implementation of layoffs or rehire
actually impacts two or more employees with the same date of paid service
and is applied only to those employees. In the case of each tie, points shall be
granted to each affected employee based upon all the following criteria:

a.

b.

c.

d.

e.
f.

Possession of a currently valid preliminary or clear California teaching
credential – 1 point
Possession of multiple valid preliminary or clear California teaching
credentials – 1 point
Possession of one or more English Language Development
certifications (e.g. LDS, CLAD, SB 1969, SB 395, BCC, BCLAD) or
other ELD qualifying credential – 1 point;
Possession of an undergraduate major or minor in: math, science,
special education – 1 point;
Possession of one or more post graduate degree(s) – 1 point;
Highest current placement on the certificated salary schedule – 1 point;

1 The nine respondents include: Tammy Comer, Elizabeth Hawkins,

Jill Kraft, Danielle Peterson, Tiffany Presgrave, Kari Richards, Geoffrey
Skjelbred, Todd Smith and Jennifer Spiva.

3

g.

h.

Spanish bilingual competency as determined by major, minor or
supplemental authorization in Spanish – 1 point;
In any case where a tie results after calculating the cumulative points
for each the [sic] above criteria, the tie shall be broken by ranking the
tied employees from lowest to highest according to the last four digits
of their social security number, with the lowest number deem less
senior than the next higher number.

(Italics in original.)

10.

After reviewing the credentials and other documents on file for each of the

three certificated employees with an August 10, 2005 hire date, and applying the above tie-
break criteria, the three were ranked as follows:

Kerry Rabusin
Elizabeth Hawkins
Tammy Comer

Rank 1
Rank 2
Rank 3

(Five Points)
(Three Points)
(Three Points)

11.

Because respondents Hawkins and Comer had the same point total, the District

applied the tie-break criterion in Resolution paragraph 5(h). Ms. Hawkins had the higher
rank based upon the last four digits of their social security numbers. She does not contest the
application of the tie-break criteria.

12. Ms. Comer contends that the District’s tie-break criteria did not reflect the

Board Resolution philosophy of determining order of termination “based solely on the needs
of the District and the students thereof.” She suggests that after criteria 5(a) through 5(g)
were applied, the District should have considered other criteria such as years of experience.

13.

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b) provides that as between

employees with the same seniority date, “the governing board shall determine the order of
termination solely on the basis of the needs of the district and the students thereof.” At one
time, the statute specifically included language allowing a lottery to determine relative
seniority. That language was replaced with the current language. (Moreland Teachers Assn.
v. Kurze (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 648, 656; Alexander v. Bd. of Trustees of Delano Joint High
School District (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 567, 573.) It is permissible to use a lottery as a final
tie-breaker after applying other objective criteria based on the needs of the District and its
students. This was done here. Resolution No. 2011-03-09.2 identified seven objective
criteria to be considered before application of a lottery based upon social security numbers.
Ms. Comer does not contend that the tie-break criteria were applied incorrectly, only that
more criteria should have been considered prior to applying a lottery to determine relative
seniority.

The tie-break criteria applied by the Board was well within its discretion to adopt, and

there was no evidence that it was based upon anything other than the needs of the District
and its students.

Welfare of the District and Its Students

14.

The Superintendent correctly identified the certificated employees providing

the particular kinds of services that the Board directed be reduced or discontinued. No junior
certificated employee is scheduled to be retained to perform services which a more senior
employee is certificated and competent to render. The reduction or discontinuation of services
relates solely to the welfare of the District’s schools and pupils, within the meaning of
Education Code section 44949.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to Education Code sections
44949 and 44955. All notices and other jurisdictional requirements of sections 44949 and
44955 were met. The notices sent to respondents indicated the statutory basis for the
reduction of services and, therefore, were sufficiently detailed to provide them due process.
(San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627; Santa Clara Federation
of Teachers v. Governing Board (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831.) The description of services to
be reduced, both in the Board Resolution and in the notices, adequately describe particular
kinds of services. (Zalac v. Ferndale USD (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838. See, also, Degener v.
Governing Board (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 689.)

2.

A District may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not,
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.) The burden is on the District to demonstrate that the reduction or elimination of
the particular kinds of services is reasonable and that the District carefully considered its
needs before laying off any certificated employee. (Campbell Elementary Teachers
Association v. Abbott, supra, 76 Cal.App.3d at pp. 807-808.)

3.

The services identified in Resolution No. 2011-03-09.2 are particular kinds of
services that may be reduced or discontinued under sections 44949 and 44955. Legal cause
exists to reduce or eliminate 8.5 FTE of particular kinds of services offered by the District as
set forth in detail in the Factual Findings. The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the
identified services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and was a proper exercise of its
discretion. Cause for the reduction or discontinuance of services relates solely to the welfare
of the District’s schools and pupils within the meaning of section 44949.

4.

The District was required to exercise tie-break criteria with respect to teachers

with a District seniority date of August 10, 2005. The application of tiebreak criteria was
appropriate.

5

5.

Cause exists for the reduction of the particular kinds of services and for the
reduction of full-time equivalent certificated positions at the end of the 2010/2011 school
year pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. No employee with less seniority
than any respondent is being retained to render a service which any respondent is certificated
and competent to render.

6.

The District’s Governing Board may give respondents final notice before May

15, 2011, that their services will not be required for the ensuing school year, 2011/2012.

RECOMMENDATION

Cause exists for the reduction of 8.5 full-time equivalent certificated positions at the

end of the 2010/2011 school year. Notice shall be given to respondents that their services
will be reduced or will not be required for the ensuing school year, 2011/2012, because of the
reduction and discontinuance of particular kinds of services. Notice shall be given in inverse
order of seniority.
