FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

On  March  9,  2004,  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Marin  Community  College 

District  adopted  Resolution  No.  2004-3-4-12C,  in  which  the  board  resolved  to  reduce  or 
discontinue  the  following  particular  kinds  of  services  for  the  2004-2005  school  year  and 
authorized  the  interim  superintendent/president  or  her  designee  to  initiate  the  procedures 
necessary  to  not  reemploy  academic/certificated  employees  pursuant  to  Education  Code 
sections  87740  and  87743:

2. 

The  district  operates  child  care  centers  at  its  two  campuses.  The  centers 

provide  child  care  services  both  for  children  of  students  at  the  campuses  and  for  children  of 
community  members.  Respondents  are  all  employees  of  the  child  care  centers.  They  are 
“permit  teachers”  who  may  be  laid  off  at  any  time  under  the  provisions  of  Education  Code 
section  8366.  However,  pursuant  to  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  between  the  district 
and  United  Professors  of  Marin,  respondents  have  been  afforded  layoff  rights  under  sections 
87740  and  87743.  Respondents  do  not  have  bumping  rights  into  any  other  programs  offered 
by  the  district. 

3. 

The  interim  superintendent/president  gave  written  notice  to  respondents  that  it 

had  been  recommended  that  notice  be  given  them  that  their  services  would  not  be  required 
for  the  2004-2005  school  year.  Respondents  all  filed  timely  requests  for  hearing  and  notices 
of  defense.  All  jurisdictional  requirements  of  Education  Code  sections  87740  and  87743 
have  been  met. 

4. 

The  interim  superintendent/president’s  recommendation  to  the  board  included 

a  one-page  explanation  of  her  recommendation  and  a  series  of  budgets  representing  four 
options  for  operation  of  the  child  care  centers  for  the  2004-2005  school  year.  Option  1 
represented  continuation  of  the  centers  at  their  current  levels,  i.e.,  preschools  at  each  of  the 
college’s  two  campuses  and  a  toddler  center  at  the  Indian  Valley  campus,  with  a  total  of  72 
slots  for  children.’  This  option  showed a  projected  deficit  of  $97,437.  It  noted,  however,  as 
did  each  of  the  budget  options,  that  the  district  was  “applying  for  $80,000  one  time  local 
grant.”  Although  in  the  explanation  of  her  recommendation  the  interim  superintendent/ 
president  said  that  the  Marin  Education  Foundation  “had  agreed  to  accept  a  proposal”  to  fund 
the  $80,000  grant,  at  the  hearing  she  testified  that  the  grant  funds  did  not  become  available 
until  after  the  board  adopted  Resolution  No.  2004-3-4-12C.  The  budget  option  the  interim 
superintendent/president  recommended,  and  which  the  board  adopted,  was  Option  2.  This 
called  for  the  elimination  of  the  Indian  Valley  toddler  program,  with  the  preschool  programs 
at  each  campus  remaining  intact.  The  number  of  children’s  slots  available  under  this  option 
dropped  to  56,  with  56  College  of  Marin  families  and  72  total  families  to  be  served.  Under 
this  option  the  projected  deficit  (without  consideration  of  the  $80,000  grant)  dropped  to 
$47,196.”  Although  the  budget  for  the  current  (2003-2004)  school  year  showed  a  projected 
year-end  surplus  for  the  child  care  centers  of  $84,192,  each  of  the  budget  options  showed  a 
carryover  to  2004-2005  of  only  $70,000. 

  

' 
The  centers  actually  serve  more  than  72  children.  Because  some  children  attend  for  only  part  of  the 
day,  more  than  one  child  may  be  accommodated  in  a  single  “slot.”  In  the  current  school  year,  the  centers 
serve  the  children  of  56  College  of  Marin  students  and  of  approximately  40  more  community  families. 
The  total  number  of  children  in  the  centers  was  not  established. 

Option  3  called  for  elimination  of  the  Indian  Valley  preschool,  leaving  its  toddler  program  and  the 

> 
Kentfield  campus  preschool  intact.  It  showed  a  projected  deficit  of  $73,050.  Option  4  called  for 
elimination  of  all  child  care  services  at  the  Indian  Valley  campus,  leaving  only  the  Kentfield  preschool, 
and  showing  a  projected  surplus  of  $40,885.  Again,  the  $80,000  grant  was  not  considered  in  either  of 

these  budgets.  

5. 

Since  the  board  adopted  Resolution  No.  2004-3-4-12C,  additional  funds  have 

been  found  that  significantly  change  the  budget  numbers.  In  particular,  the  district  has 
identified  an  additional  $20,000  in  parent  fees  that  had  not  been  included  in  the  various 
budget  options  and  the  budget  carryover  from  the  current  school  year  is  now  projected  to  be 
$141,854  rather  than  $84,192.  As  a  result,  the  updated  projection  for  Option  2,  including  the 
$80,000  grant  and  the  $141,854  carryover,  shows  that  the  program  would  end  the  2004-2005 
school  year  with  a  surplus  of  $82,517,  not  the  deficit  of  $47,196  that  was  presented  to  the 
board. 

6. 

Respondents  point  out  that,  with  the  updated  budget  numbers,  keeping  the 

child  care  center  program  intact  for  the  2004-2005  school  year  would  result  in  the  program 
showing  a  $37,656  surplus  at  the  end  of  that  year  rather  than  the  $97,437  deficit  that  was 
presented  to  the  board.  Respondents  contend  that  there  are  therefore  no  financial  circum- 
stances  that  make  it  necessary  to  reduce  the  child  care  center  program  and  to  terminate  their 
employment.  Respondents  argue  that,  because  the  district  administrators  “misled”  the  board 
about  the  district’s  financial  condition  and  because  financial  circumstances  do  not  necessitate 
the  layoff  of  child  care  center  employees,  to  lay  them  off  would  be  an  arbitrary  and 
capricious  act  that  violates  the  Education  Code. 

7. 

The  interim  superintendent/president  concedes  that  the  district  could  run  the 

child  care  program  at  its  existing  level  for  the  2004-2005  school  year  without  creating  a 
deficit.  However,  doing  so  would  result  in  a  very  small  end-of-the-year  carryover  and,  she 
notes,  the  program  “has  been  living  off  carryover  money.”  The  carryover  for  the  current 
year  was  reduced  by  nearly  50%  from  the  prior  year.  If  the  program  were  to  remain  at  its 
current  level  for  the  2004-2005  school  year  (Option  1),  the  projection  for  the  2005-2006 
school  year  shows  that  the  program  would  end  that  year  with  a  deficit  of  $189,884.  The 
district’s  dean  of  enrollment  services,  who  has  direct  responsibility  for  the  child  care 
program,  testified  that  this  deficit  would  be  so  severe  that  the  district  would  be  forced  to 
eliminate  all  child  care  at  both  campuses  unless  a  new  funding  source  could  be  found.  And  it 
was  noted  that  the  Marin  Education  Foundation’s  $80,000  grant  comes  with  a  stipulation  that 
requires  the  district  to  follow  through  with  a  strategic  plan  that  would  make  the  child  care 
centers  self-funding.  Respondents  do  not  dispute  that,  if  no  cuts  are  made  in  the  program, 
the  district  will  be  unable  to  operate  the  child  care  centers  on  a  self-sustaining  basis  for  2005- 
2006.  But  they  assert  that  the  district’s  2005-2006  projections  are  based  on  “a  series  of 
pessimistic  assumptions.”  (Conversely,  the  district  asserts  its  assumptions  were  “prudent” 
ones.) 

8. 

There  is  no  evidence  the  district  acted  fraudulently,  arbitrarily  or  capriciously. 

It  is  true  the  budget  numbers  upon  which  the  interim  superintendent/president  made  her 
recommendation  to  the  board  have  changed,  and  that  it  would  now  be  possible  to  keep  the 
child  care  program  intact  for  the  2004-2005  school  year  without  creating  a  budget  deficit. 
But  that  does  not  make  the  district’s  decision  to  go  forward  with  the  proposed  reduction  an 
arbitrary  or  capricious  one.  The  district  and  the  board  have  broad  discretion  in  determining 
whether  and  to  what  extent  to  reduce  services.  Here,  while  the  district  could  continue  to 
provide  child  care  services  at  their  current  level  without  creating  an  immediate  budget 

   

deficit,  it  has  determined  that  the  longer  term  effects  of  doing  so  would  result  in  the  creation 
of  a  larger,  and  essentially  unmanageable,  deficit.  Whether  the  assumptions  the  district  has 
based  that  determination  upon  are  properly  characterized  as  “pessimistic”  or  “prudent”  is  of 
no  consequence.  It  is  within  the  district’s  and  the  board’s  discretion  to  opt  for  a  small 
reduction  in  services  now  in  order  to  increase  the  chances  of  saving  the  child  care  program  in 
future  years.  And  such  a  decision,  taken  in  consideration  of  the  overall  welfare  of  the  child 
care  program  and  of  the  colleges  and  their  students,  cannot  be  found  to  be  fraudulent, 
arbitrary  or  capricious.  No  abuse  of  discretion  was  shown.

Respondent  Yolanda  Rossi  is  the  designated  assistant  site  supervisor  at  the 

It  is 

Kentfield  child  care  center.  She  is  the  only  designated  assistant  supervisor  at  the  site. 
undisputed  that  state  law  requires  child  care  centers  to  have  a  site  supervisor  at  the  facility  at 
all  times.  A  site  supervisor  is  a  position  for  which  the  Department  of  Education  issues  a 
special  permit.  No  such  permit  is  required  to  be  an  assistant  site  supervisor  and  the  law  does 
not  require  that  a  facility  have  an  assistant  supervisor.  The  district  has  not  yet  determined 
whether  there  will  be  assistant  site  supervisors  at  either  child  care  center  next  year.  Nor  has 
the  district  yet  determined  how  the  requirement  that  a  site  supervisor  be  present  at  all  times 
will  be  met  should  the  supervisor  need  to  be  absent  from  the  facility.  But  teachers  can  be 
designated  to  serve  as  assistant  site  supervisors  in  the  absence  of  the  site  supervisor,  and  that 
is  what  the  district  sometimes  does  now.  Respondent  Rossi  has  failed  to  establish  that  her 
designation  as  an  assistant  site  supervisor  somehow  insulates  her  from  layoff  in  this 
proceeding. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Respondents’  assertion  that  Education  Code  section  87743  permits  districts  to 
lay  off  employees  only  when  necessary  is  correct.  But  respondents  seem  to  read  that  section 
to  mean  that  layoffs  may  occur  only  when  there  is  a  financial  necessity.  What  the  section 
actually  provides,  however,  is  that  a  district  may  lay  off  certificated  employees  only  when  “it 
shall  have  become  necessary  by  reason  of”  either  a  decline  in  attendance  or  a  reduction  in 
particular  kinds  of  services.  In  other  words,  section  87743  does  not  require  a  district  to  show 
that  financial  difficulties  have  made  it  necessary  to  lay  off  employees,  rather  the  district  must 
only  show  that  the  reduction  of  services  necessitates  the  layoff.  Here,  the  district  has  done 
that  since  the  elimination  of  the  Indian  Valley  toddler  center  means  the  district  will  require 
fewer  employees  to  operate  the  child  care  program.  The  “necessity  requirement”  of  section 
87743  has  been  met. 

2. 

Cause  for  the  elimination  of  3.12  FTE  positions  exists  in  accordance  with 

Education  Code  sections  87740  and  87743.  This  cause  relates  to  the  welfare  of  the  colleges 
and  the  students  thereof  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  87740.  Cause 
thereby  exists  to  give  respondents  notice  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2004- 

2005  school  year.  

e 

ORDER 

Notice  may  be  given  respondents  Erin  Dooley,  Barbara  Price  and  Yolanda  Rossi  that 

their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2004-2005  school  year.
