FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1. 

On March 2, 2010, the Governing Board of the district (the board) adopted 

 
 
Resolution number 09-10-21, determining that it would be necessary to reduce or discontinue 
particular kinds of services (PKS) at the end of the current school year.  The board 
determined that the PKS that must be reduced for the 2010-2011 school year were the 
following full time equivalent (FTE) positions: 
 

Two certificated employees, Rachel Ballenger and Olga Koeppen failed to submit requests for hearing and 

                                                 
1  
at the outset of the hearing the preliminary layoff notice served on Gerald Hoffman was rescinded and the 
accusation was dismissed as to Hoffman; consequently, this hearing focused on the 11 remaining certificated 
employees (respondents).

funding.”
