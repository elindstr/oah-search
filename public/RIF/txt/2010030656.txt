This matter was heard before Marilyn A. Woollard, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ),

On April 23, 2010, the District and the Represented Respondents entered into Joint 

Stipulations, set forth in Attachment C (“Joint Stipulations”), which resulted in a settlement 
of this matter.  The hearing was convened, the Joint Stipulations were read into the record,

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND AND FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1. 

At the commencement of the hearing, the District and Represented 

Respondents notified the undersigned ALJ that they had entered into and agreed with the 
Joint Stipulations, which are fully incorporated here by reference, and that the Joint

Stipulations would result in a settlement of the matters set forth in the District’s Accusation 
dated April 5, 2010 (Accusation) with respect to Represented Respondents.   
 

2. 

The District advised the undersigned ALJ that none of the Self-Represented 
Respondents had filed a notice of defense in response to the Accusation with the District in 
accordance with California Government Code section 11506.   
 

There was no evidence or argument presented to the contrary.  Consequently, 
pursuant to Education Code section 44949, subdivision (c), and Government Code section 
11506, Self-Represented Respondents waived their right to a hearing.

As set forth in Finding 1, the District has agreed to rescind the preliminary 
layoff notices served upon respondents Wirth, Arsenith, Schroeder, Tanz and McComb.

As set forth in Finding 1, the District has agreed to take any and all appropriate 

actions to permit respondents Hurst, Shuck, Klemp-Sorber, Ellsworth, Ahrens, Phillips, 
Brown and McMahon to remain eligible for rehire pursuant to California Education Code 
sections 44956 or 44957, as the case may be, regardless of whether he or she declines one or 
more offers of reemployment during his or her applicable rehire period (24 or 39 months 
from the date of termination, as the case may be).  (Joint Stipulation No. 2.) 
 

5. 

As set forth in Finding 1, the District has agreed to allow respondents Wirth, 

Arsenith, Schroeder, Tanz and McComb to apply for voluntary transfer into vacancies  
pursuant to and in accordance with the District’s currently effective collective bargaining 
agreement with the Black Oak Mine Teachers Association, even if the response date for 
voluntary transfer requests was prior to April 23, 2010. (Joint Stipulation No. 6.) 
 

6. 

As set forth in Finding 2, each of the Self-Represented Respondents has 

waived his or her right to a hearing to determine if there is cause for not reemploying him or 
her for the ensuing year pursuant to California Government Code section 11506, subdivision 

 

2 

(c), and Education Code section 44949, subdivision (c)(1), due to his or her failure to file a
