PROPOSED DECISION 
 

Ingrid A. Meyers, Dannis Woliver Kelley, represented Clif Black, Superintendent, 

Administrative Law Judge Steven C. Owyang, State of California, Office of 
 
Administrative Hearings, heard this matter in San Jose, California, on April 22 and 23, and 
May 4, 2010. 
 
 
Evergreen School District. 
 
 
Attachment A. 
 
 
 

Christopher Schumb, Attorney at Law, represented the respondents, who are listed in 

The matter was submitted on May 4, 2010. 

FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1. 

Clif Black, Superintendent, Evergreen School District (District), issued the 

accusation in his official capacity. 
 

Respondents are certificated employees of the District. 

The District’s past practice was to hire virtually all its teachers as “temporary” 

teachers and to list their status as such.  Will Ector, Director of Human Resources, 
acknowledged at hearing that this practice was not in compliance with the requirements of 
the Education Code.  Ector attempted to rectify this practice, but as late as fall 2009 the 
District did not have an accurate seniority list.  In an attempt to create an accurate seniority 
list, the District in December 2009 gave each respondent written notice of his/her 
employment status, seniority date and credentials and asked each respondent to verify his/her 
credentials and hire date.  The District continued to make corrections to its seniority list 
through the last day of hearing in this matter.

4. 

The parties stipulated that all of the jurisdictional requirements of Education 

Code sections 44949 and 44955 have been met in this proceeding. 
 

5. 

On March 4, 2010, the Governing Board of the District (Board) adopted 

Resolution #11/09-10, setting forth criteria for establishing the order of termination among 
employees who have the same date of first rendering paid service (“tie-breaking criteria”). 
 

The tie-breaking criteria assign points as follows:

The Board further determined that the District may deviate from terminating (“skip”) 

 
certificated employees in order of seniority, based on a specific need for personnel who possess 
special training and/or experience, or competency, necessary to teach specific courses or 
courses of study or to provide specific services, which others with more seniority do not 
possess, as follows: 

1. 
2.

7. 
8. 
9. 

Resource Specialist 
Special Day Class 
Pre-K Special Day Class

The Board directed Superintendent Black or his designated representative to give 

notices to certificated employees that their services would not be needed for the 2010 – 2011 
school year. 
 

7. 

By April 21, 2010, the District had revised the particular kinds of services it 

sought to reduce to:

is for a mandated service.

following respondents:

9. 

By May 4, 2010, the District had created an updated seniority list that included 

employees proposed to be laid off and retained.  (Exhibit 12.)  The list took into account the 
tie-breaking criteria, skipping of employees providing certain services (such as math, 
science, and special education), “bumping” of certain employees into positions for which 
they are credentialed and competent, positively-assured attrition, and non-reelections of 

4

temporary employees.  The list also corrected errors in the seniority dates and status of 
various employees.  
 

At the May 4, 2010, hearing, the District acknowledged that the following employees 
were mistakenly listed as having probationary status on the updated seniority list and should 
have been listed as having permanent status:   

The District is committed to meeting and conferring with its employees to ensure that 

 
 
its employees are credited with the correct credentials, status, and seniority date.  The 
District is further committed to meeting and conferring with its employees regarding the 
application of tie-breaking criteria for employees with the same seniority date. 
 

10.  At the May 4, 2010, hearing, the District rescinded the accusations of the 

following respondents:

11. 

By the close of hearing, the District again reduced the number of respondents 
to be terminated.  The District sought the authority to layoff respondents comprising 44 FTE 
positions.  No permanent or probationary certificated employee with less seniority than a 
respondent is being retained to provide a service for which a respondent is credentialed and 
competent to render.  
 

12. 

The reduction or discontinuation of services is related to the welfare of the 

district and of its pupils. 
 

Factual Findings 8 and 10. 
 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Cause exists to dismiss the accusations against the respondents identified in 

2. 

Because of the reduction of particular kinds of services set forth in Factual 

Findings 6 and 7, as revised by District’s request at hearing for authority to terminate 
respondents comprising 44 FTE positions (Factual Finding 11), cause exists pursuant to 
Education Code section 44955 to give notice to the remaining respondents comprising 44 
FTE positions that their services will not be required for the 2010 – 2011 school year.  This 
cause solely relates to the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof within the meaning of 
Education Code section 44949. 
 

ORDER 

The accusations against the respondents identified in Factual Findings 8 and 

1. 
10 are dismissed. 
 

2. 

Notice may be given to the remaining respondents, comprising up to 44 FTE 

positions, that their services will not be required for the 2010 – 2011 school year.
