FACTUAL FINDINGS 

2. 

1. 

Respondents are certificated employees of the district.  The respondents are 

Complainant Carlos A. Garcia issued the accusation in his official capacity as 

 
 
Superintendent of the San Francisco Unified School District (district). 
 
 
identified on Appendix A, attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. 
 
 
102-23504, in which it resolved to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services for the  
2010-2011 school year, and directed the superintendent to give notice to certificated 
employees that their services would be terminated at the end of the 2009-2010 school year 
(the PKS resolution).  The services to be reduced or discontinued are identified on Appendix 
B, attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. 
 

On February 23, 2010, the district’s governing board adopted Resolution  

3. 

The resolution states that “a total of 163 FTE in administrative services and 482 FTE 

in instructional services (as listed on Exhibit A) shall be reduced or eliminated . . . .” 
(Original emphasis.)1  Exhibit A to the resolution identifies the particular services to be 
reduced or eliminated.  The reductions in administrative services called for in Exhibit A total 
163 FTE, but the reductions in instructional services set forth in that document total 502 
FTE, as opposed to 482 FTE.  The reason for the discrepancy was not explained.  Because 
the text of the resolution calls for reductions in services as set forth in Exhibit A, which 
specifically identifies the reductions to be made, it is determined that Exhibit A controls and 
that the entry of 482 FTE in the text of the resolution was an error. 

 
4. 

As a general principle, permanent and probationary certificated employees 
must be laid off in inverse order of their seniority.  (Ed. Code, § 44955, subd. (c).)  Under 
Education Code section 44955, subdivision (d), however, a district may deviate from 
seniority and “skip” junior employees under certain circumstances. 

 
Board Resolution 102-23504 establishes the district’s skipping criteria.  The 

resolution states: 
 

[P]ursuant to Education Code § 44955(d)(1), it will be necessary 
to retain the services of certificated employees in the 2010-2011 
school year regardless of seniority, who possess credentials and 
qualifications needed for and who are actually assigned to 
render service in the following programs: Math, Science, 
Special Education and Bilingual Education.  To be considered 
qualified and credentialed to serve in the District’s Bilingual 
Education Programs, the retained employee must hold a 
BCLAD. 

                                                 

1  FTE means “full-time equivalent.”

5. 

Under Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), no permanent employee 

 
may be terminated “while any probationary employee, or any other employee with less 
seniority, is retained to render a service which said permanent employee is certificated and 
competent to render.”   The process by which a senior employee displaces a junior employee 
is commonly referred to as “bumping.” 
 
 
bumping rights of senior employees.  It states in relevant part: 
 

On February 23, 2010, the board adopted Resolution No. 102-23506, concerning the 

[T]he following criteria will be used to determine competency 
for retention in the position: 
 
1. 
 
2. 
 

Credential in the discipline[.] 

EL Certification: 

a. 
b. 

BCLAD

Service for at least one complete, continuous school year 
in the last five school years in the same assignment. 

At least one year of prior experience teaching in the 
discipline to which the employee seeks to move within 
the last five years.

6. 

Under Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), the governing board of 

 
 
a district must determine the relative seniority of employees with the same seniority date 
based “on the needs of the district and the students thereof.” 
 
 
establishing tie-breaking criteria.  The resolution states: 
 

On February 23, 2010, the governing board adopted Resolution No. 102-23505, 

One point will be added for each of the following credentials or 
authorizations: 
 
1. 

Cross Cultural Language and Academic Development 
(CLAD) Certification. 

Emergency CLAD or current (as of 1/29/2010) 
enrollment in CLAD Certificated Program[.] 

Possession of a Bilingual Cross Cultural Language and 
Academic Certification (BCLAD).

4. 

Breadth of credential(s).  (Point awarded only if the 
employee also holds CLAD or BCLAD.) 

Breadth is defined as follows: two or more credentials where at 
least one is math, science, or special education. 

 
 

 

Any ties that may occur after application of these criteria shall 
be resolved by lottery. 

7. 

On or before March 15, 2010, respondents were timely served with written 

 
 
notice of the superintendent’s recommendation that their services will not be required for the 
2010-2011 school year.2  The reasons for the recommendation were set forth in these 
preliminary layoff notices.  Each respondent timely requested a hearing to determine if there 
is cause for not reemploying him or her for the 2010-2011 school year.  The district issued an 
accusation against each respondent, and each respondent filed a timely notice of defense.  All 
prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met. 
 
 
district faces a two-year projected budget deficit through Fiscal Year 2011-2012 of $113 
million.  The district had hoped to avoid reductions that affected its classrooms but, after 
thoroughly examining its budget, came to the conclusion that it could not do so.  Without the 
reductions called for by the PKS resolution, the district will be bankrupt. 
 

Based on the governor’s proposed state budget for Fiscal Year 2010-2011, the

9. 

Angie Sagastume is the district’s Executive Director for Certificated 

Recruitment and Staffing.  She has been with the district for 18 years, and has been involved 
in all of the district’s layoffs since 2003.  Sagastume and her staff implemented the board’s 
resolution to reduce services.   

 
To summarize and oversimplify a complex process, Sagastume began by updating the 
district’s seniority lists of probationary and permanent teachers.  Every teacher was asked to 
verify or identify discrepancies in the district’s records regarding his or her seniority, 
credentials, and assignment; the teachers’ responses were researched and the seniority lists 
were updated.  Sagastume applied the board’s tie-breaking criteria to determine the relative 
seniority of teachers with the same seniority date.  Sagastume identified those employees 
who might be subject to layoff by examining the seniority list with reference to the board’s 
PKS resolution and then, starting with the least senior probationary employee, continuing up 
the list until the necessary reductions were achieved.  In doing so, Sagastume and her staff 
identified those employees who had a right to bump junior employees and those employees 
who were entitled to be skipped under the board’s resolutions.  In the course of this process, 
the district prepared draft bumping charts and shared them with UESF.  Sagastume testified 
that the bumping charts are necessarily “works in progress” until rescissions have been 

                                                 

2  Respondent Brian Adam Becker testified that he did not receive a preliminary layoff notice.  

The evidence establishes, however, that a preliminary layoff notice was timely served on Becker by mail, 
at his last known address, in the manner prescribed by Education Code section 44949.

accounted for and until the various claims presented in the hearing have been resolved.  
Sagastume testified further that when final layoff notices are sent out, no probationary 
employee, and no other junior employee, will be retained to render a service that a permanent 
employee with more seniority is certificated and competent to render.  Sagastume’s 
testimony was credible and no contrary evidence was presented.

Joint Exhibit 1. 
 
Bumping issues 
 
 
12.  UESF challenges the district’s bumping criteria, which require the senior 
employee to demonstrate service for at least one complete, continuous school year in the 
same assignment, and one year teaching in the discipline to which the employee seeks to 
move, all within the last five years.  UESF argues that these competency criteria preclude 
many otherwise highly-qualified individuals from bumping, including respondents Judi 
Bliquez, Patricia Ann Koblenz, Christina Nelson and Kevin Odle.  UESF contends that the 
district’s criteria are arbitrary and capricious, and therefore invalid.

  The governing board has broad discretion to establish standards of competency for 
 
the purpose of exercising bumping rights.  (Duax v. Kern Community College Dist. (1987) 
198 Cal.App.3d 555, 564-567.)  Whether the board has acted arbitrarily and capriciously “‘is 
measured by the standard set by reason and reasonable people, bearing in mind that such a 
standard may permit a difference of opinion on the same subject.’”  (Campbell Elementary 
Teachers Assn. v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 808.) 
 

The fundamental requirement of competency criteria is that they must relate to the 

In this case, Deputy Superintendent Richard Carranza testified that the district’s 

skills and qualifications to teach.  (Duax v. Kern Community College Dist., supra, 198 
Cal.App.3d at pp. 556-557.)  In Duax, the governing board adopted a competency standard 
that prohibited a senior employee from exercising bumping rights unless he or she could 
demonstrate one full year of teaching in the junior employee’s subject area within the last 10 
years.  The district’s assistant chancellor testified that he recommended that standard to 
emphasize tasks important to teaching, such as teaching skills, development of course 
material, interaction with students, knowledge of student abilities, and evaluation of student 
work.  The court held that the board’s standard clearly related to the skills and qualifications 
to teach and, “since it requires only one year of teaching in the last ten, not one in the last 
two or three, we are not persuaded that it too narrowly defines competency.”  (Id. at p. 567.) 
 
 
bumping criteria are designed to emphasize teaching skills and subject matter competence.  
In the district’s view, serving for one continuous year in a teaching assignment demonstrates 
that the teacher has been required to develop and implement lesson plans, communicate with 
parents, assess student mastery, and develop working relationships with colleagues, all on a 
long-term basis.  Teaching in the junior employee’s subject matter for one year within the 
last five years is designed to assure that the teacher is current in the subject matter.  As was 
the case in Duax, the board’s standards are clearly related to the skills and qualifications to 
teach.  It is true that the board’s standards in this case are narrower than those upheld in 
Duax.  An argument could be made that the board’s criteria are too strict, and that the board 
should have allowed teachers to demonstrate their skills over the past 10 years, or over the 
past six years.  But this is an area that lies within the board’s discretion.  It cannot be said, 
based on the present record, that the competency criteria adopted by the board are 
unreasonable.  The criteria are not arbitrary and capricious and are not invalid. 
 

13. 

Respondent Judi Bliquez is a peer resource teacher at Roosevelt Middle 

School, where she trains students to serve as peer mentors and tutors in math.  She also trains 
conflict managers and provides peer education.  She is tenured at 0.75 FTE.  It appears that 
she was identified for layoff due to reductions in “Teachers on Special Assignment – Peer 
Resources.”  Bliquez came to the district in 2007 with extensive experience teaching math to 
at-risk math learners.  As UESF acknowledges, however, Bliquez has not taught a subject 
matter in a classroom for a full year.  The evidence also fails to establish that Bliquez has one 

 

6

 
14. 

 
15. 

 
16. 

year’s experience in the past five years teaching in the discipline to which she would like to 
move.  The evidence does not establish that Bliquez is eligible to bump a junior employee.3 

The PKS resolution identifies reductions in a program entitled “Teachers on 

Special Assignment – Academic Development Program” or “TSA – ADP.”  There are 
reductions in TSA’s at the elementary, middle and high school levels. 

 
Respondents James Zucchi, Michelle See, Kristy Feibus, Elizabeth C. Hull Barnes, 

Justin Stoddard and Kathryn Ann Steinbach are classroom teachers.  In a layoff list published 
by the district on March 16, 2010, which on its face identifies layoffs by subject, these 
respondents found that they were identified for layoff under the category “TSA – APD.”  
None of them is a teacher on special assignment.  At hearing, they questioned whether they 
had been properly identified for layoff. 

 
Sagastume testified that respondents Zucchi, See, Feibus, Barnes, Stoddard and 

Steinbach were identified for layoff because they were bumped by more senior teachers in 
the TSA – ADP program; that is why their names appeared under TSA – APD on the March 
16, 2010 list.  No contrary evidence was presented. 

Respondent Jenny Arietta is a probationary math teacher but she appears on 

the March 16, 2010 layoff list under the category of “Librarian,” a service identified for 
reductions in the PKS resolution.  She questions whether she was properly identified for 
layoff. 
 
Sagastume testified that respondent Arietta was identified for layoff because she was 
bumped by a more senior librarian; that is why she appears on the March 16, 2010 list under 
Librarian.  No contrary evidence was presented. 

Respondent Kyle Noone teaches physical education at James Lick Middle 

School.  Noone testified that he had reviewed certain documents that led him to believe that 
two physical education teachers junior to him were being retained.  The evidence established 
that the two teachers he identified were probationary teachers who have been nonreelected 
for the 2010-2011 school year.  The evidence does not establish that there are any teachers 
junior to Noone who are being retained to provide services that Noone is certificated and 
competent to render. 

 
17.  UESF argues that the district failed to meet its burden of proof because it did 

not introduce into evidence a bumping chart that identifies each employee to be laid off.  
UESF does not offer any authority to support this argument, and it is not persuasive. 

 
A district is not required to identify the number of teachers to be terminated or the 
specific positions to be eliminated, much less the names of the specific teachers to be laid 

                                                 

3  In view of these findings, it is not necessary to address the district’s additional argument that, as 

a part-time employee, respondent Bliquez is not entitled to bump a full-time employee.  

 

7

off, when it sends out preliminary layoff notices in March.  (San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen 
(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 632-633.)  And in a case like this, which involves challenges to 
the district’s bumping and skipping criteria as well as numerous other claims which 
potentially affect the order of termination, the particular teachers to be terminated cannot be 
determined until those claims are finally resolved.  To meet its burden of proof, a district 
must come forward with credible and persuasive evidence that it will meet its obligation 
under Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b); that is, that it will not terminate any 
permanent employee while any probationary employee, or any other employee with less 
seniority, is retained to render a service that the permanent employee is certificated and 
competent to render.  The district has met its burden in this case through the credible and 
uncontradicted testimony of Sagastume (Finding 9) and the documents that support her 
testimony. 
 
Skipping issues 
 
 
Education Code section 44955, subdivision (d), “specifies the only way that a senior 
employee can be denied the ability to bump a junior employee.  That is when the junior 
employees has ‘special training and experience necessary’ to provide a particular kind of 
service that is not being cut that the senior employee does not possess.”  Subdivision (d) of 
section 44955, however, does not concern the right of a senior employee to bump a junior 
employee; it concerns the district’s right to deviate from seniority and skip a junior employee 
who would otherwise face layoff. 

18.  UESF argues that the district’s skipping criteria are invalid.  It asserts that 

 
UESF goes on to argue that section 44955, subdivision (d), “does not require that the 

senior employee be ‘actively’ engaged in rendering the service at the time the decision to 
reduce or eliminate services is made.  Adding the requirement that the senior employee must 
be ‘actually assigned to render the service’ goes beyond the authorization by the Legislature 
to allow a District to keep a senior employee from ‘bumping’ a junior employee.”  Again, the 
district resolution at issue speaks to skipping, not bumping; it does not purport to limit the 
right of a senior employee to bump a junior employee.  The district’s requirement that a 
skipped employee must be “actually assigned” to render the needed service is consistent 
with, not contrary to, the requirements of section 44955, subdivision (d).  (See Alexander v. 
Board of Trustees (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 567, 576.) 

 
UESF’s argument that the district’s skipping criteria are inconsistent with state law is 

19.  UESF argues that the district improperly retained Philip Pasmanick, who is not 

not persuasive. 
 
 
a respondent in this proceeding.  Pasmanick is a bilingual classroom teacher at Hillcrest 
Elementary School.  He holds a multiple subject credential, a single subject credential in 
Spanish, and a bilingual certificate of competence.  (He also holds various designated subject 
adult education credentials, including one in health occupations and one in English and 
Speech Arts; these credentials, however, do not authorize him to teach at the K-12 level.)  
Pasmanick is a permanent employee with a seniority date of August 19, 2009.  The reason 

 

8

for his recent seniority date is that he was employed by the district as a permanent teacher, 
left district employment, and then returned on August 19, 2009.  Under Education Code 
sections 44931 and 44848, a teacher who leaves district employment and returns within 39 
months is entitled to retain his tenure, but loses his original seniority date; his seniority date 
becomes the date he is reemployed.  (San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen, supra, 144 
Cal.App.3d at p. 641.)  Sagastume testified that Pasmanick was retained because the district 
laid off probationary employees before permanent employees.  It is her understanding that all 
probationary employees in a particular kind of service, regardless of their seniority, must be 
terminated before a permanent employee rendering the same service is terminated.  Her 
understanding is correct.  (Ed. Code, § 44955, subd. (b).)   
 

 

UESF acknowledges that Pasmanick is properly classified as a permanent employee 

but asserts that, under Allen, he “[does] not get to exercise the rights of permanency” in a 
layoff.  Allen does not so hold.  The reemployed employees in Allen were classified as 
permanent employees.  The court held that their seniority dates changed when they were 
reemployed, but did not hold that they were misclassified or that they were not entitled to the 
rights of permanent employees under Education Code section 44955. 

 
UESF asserts that the PKS resolution calls for the elimination of 10 middle school 
English teachers and 20 high school English teachers, and that there are 96 teachers with 
English credentials senior to Pasmanick and 13 who share the same seniority date.  
Pasmanick, however, is a bilingual classroom teacher, not an English teacher.  UESF states 
that Pasmanick is the most junior employee with a health credential, while others with health 
credentials are being laid off.  Pasmanick’s designated subject adult education credential, 
however, does not authorize him to teach in elementary school and he is not a health teacher. 

  
The evidence fails to establish that the district improperly retained Pasmanick. 
 
20.  UESF argues that the district improperly retained Liana Jane Wong, who is not 

a respondent in this proceeding.  Wong is a high school counselor.  She is a permanent 
employee with a recent seniority date of August 31, 2009, because, like Pasmanick, she 
attained permanent status with the district, left district employment, and was reemployed 
within 39 months on August 31, 2009.  Sagastume testified that Wong did not receive a 
layoff notice because probationary counselors were laid off before she, as a permanent 
employee, was reached. 

 
UESF asserts that the PKS resolution authorizes the elimination of seven middle 

school counselors and 18 high school counselors and there are only eight counselors on the 
layoff list junior to Wong, and 43 who are senior to Wong.  UESF does not state the factual 
basis for its assertion, and does not address the fact that there are over 35 probationary 
counselors.  Probationary counselors must be terminated before any permanent counselor, 
such as Wong, is terminated. 

 
The evidence fails to establish that the district improperly retained Wong.

Respondent Christina Romano is a reading recovery and literacy specialist at 

Romano received a layoff notice under the provisions of the PKS resolution that call 

Bryant Elementary School, a bilingual school.  She has a multiple subject credential, a 
BCLAD, a CLAD, and a reading recovery certificate.  She works with first through fifth 
grade students on a pull-out or push-in basis.  For the students in grades one and two, she 
instructs in Spanish; she introduces instruction in English to second grade students about 
half-way through the semester.  For third grade students, she typically instructs in English 
and by the fourth grade her instruction is entirely in English. 
 
 
for a 4.0 FTE reduction in “Resource Teachers – Literacy,” a program identified in the 
resolution as a “non-classroom program.”  Romano contends that she should be skipped 
under the provisions of the PKS resolution that allow the district to deviate from seniority to 
retain teachers who are “actually assigned to render service in the Bilingual Education 
program.”  Sagastume testified, however, that the bilingual program refers to the teaching 
program, and that the position of Literacy Specialist is not part of the district’s bilingual 
program.  The PKS resolution supports Sagastume’s testimony.   
 

Romano is not entitled to be skipped.  It is recognized that she works in a bilingual 

school and uses Spanish in her work as a literacy specialist.  The district, however, may 
deviate from seniority only when it can demonstrate a need to retain teachers for a particular 
course or course of study.  (Ed. Code, § 44955, subd. (d).)  The evidence does not establish 
that literacy specialists teach a course or course of study, and the district has not identified a 
need to retain literacy specialists. 

 
22. 

 
24. 

Respondent Erin Stack is an Instructional Resource Facilitator (IRF) at 

 
Monroe Elementary School, where she works half-time as a literacy coach and half-time as a 
school advocate.  In essence, she works with teachers to help them improve classroom 
education.  Stack contends that she should be skipped because she holds a BCLAD.  Stack, 
however, does not meet the skipping criteria because she is not actually assigned to provide 
bilingual education.  Stack is not entitled to be skipped. 
 
Seniority issues 
 

23. 

The general rule is that a certificated employee’s seniority commences “on the 

date upon which he first rendered paid service in a probationary position.”  (Ed. Code,  
§ 44845.) 

Respondent Christine Maiko Lee holds a certificated position as a counselor.  
She has been assigned a seniority date of November 3, 2008.  Lee asserts that she is entitled 
to an earlier seniority date by virtue of her prior service to the district as a Wellness 
Coordinator. 
 
Prior to November 2008, Lee worked for the district as a classified employee.  In Fall 

2002, Lee accepted a position with the district as a Health Worker IV (Class 2588), 
commonly known as a “Wellness Coordinator.”  As a Wellness Coordinator, Lee coordinated 

 

10

mental health services, counseling services, and workshops and promoted health awareness 
activities and events.  She worked under the School Health Program.  This position did not 
require a Pupil Personnel Services credential, but Lee obtained her PPS credential in June 
2005. 

 
In Spring 2006, the district and UESF encouraged all of the Wellness Coordinators to 

obtain a PPS credential and become certificated employees of the district.  It appears the 
district had learned that, because of their direct contact with students, some Wellness 
Coordinators and Learning Support Consultants (LSC’s) were required by state law to be 
credentialed.  Lee was not informed that she would lose her job if she failed to become 
certificated, but she and all of the other Wellness Coordinators were encouraged to make the 
switch because it would mean more job security. 

 
In June 2006 Lee applied for a certificated position as a Wellness Coordinator.  Her 
transition to a certificated position was delayed for over a year while the district corrected a 
mistake in Lee’s salary level.  The first day she rendered paid service to the district in a 
probationary capacity was November 3, 2008, the day the district has assigned to her as her 
seniority date. 
 
Lee acknowledges that, as a general rule, classified service may not be tacked on to 
certificated service to establish an earlier seniority date.  Lee asserts that she falls within an 
exception set forth in Education Code section 44066, which reads as follows: 
 

A governing board of any school district . . . or other appointing 
authority shall not require an employee or applicant to possess 
any certification, license, or other credential unless the 
possession of such a certification, license, or other credential is 
required by statute or is based upon a bona fide occupational 
qualification. 
 
It is the intent of the Legislature that any person who had served 
in a position for which certification, license, or other credential 
not necessitated by statute or bona fide occupational 
qualification, had been required, and in a position which was 
designated by the governing board as a position requiring 
certification qualifications, shall be deemed to be an employee 
in a position requiring certification qualifications for as long as 
he or she holds such position and it is further the intent of the 
Legislature that such position shall be deemed to be a 
certificated position for as long as such person holds such 
position. 

 
Lee claims that she was required by the district to obtain a credential and that, under section 
44066, she is entitled to seniority for all of the time she served as a Wellness Coordinator. 
 

 

11

Lee’s argument is not persuasive, for two reasons.  As Lee acknowledged in her 

 
testimony, although the district encouraged the Wellness Coordinators to become 
credentialed, it did not require them to do so; Lee herself was already credentialed in the 
spring of 2006.  More fundamentally, section 44066 addresses employees who were wrongly 
required to become credentialed.  It expresses the Legislature’s intent that such an employee 
shall be deemed certificated for the period that he or she was required to have a credential 
that was “not necessitated by statute or bona fide occupational qualification.”  Even if Lee 
and the other Wellness Coordinators were required to become credentialed, there is no 
evidence that the credential was not necessitated by statute or that it was not a bona fide 
occupational qualification.  The only evidence on that point suggests that the credential was 
required by state law. 
 

Lee argues that, at the least, she should be given an earlier seniority because the 
district’s salary errors prevented her from assuming a certificated position earlier.  Lee cites 
no authority, and no authority has been found, for the proposition that administrative errors 
estop the district from applying the seniority rule set forth in Education Code section 44845.  
Lee’s assigned seniority date of November 3, 2008, is correct. 

 
25. 

Respondent Sandeep Kumar has an employment history with the district that is 

similar to respondent Lee’s.  Kumar is a certificated Learning Support Professional (LSP).  
He provides mental health perspectives to students and staff at his assigned schools.  He has 
been assigned a seniority date of August 19, 2009, the first date that he rendered paid service 
to the district in a probationary position. 

 
From August 27, 2007, to August 19, 2009, Kumar worked for the district in a 
classified position as an LSP.  In 2007 and 2008, the district encouraged the LSP’s to become 
certificated in the same way that it encouraged the Wellness Coordinators.  At a meeting with 
the LSP’s, district employee Meyla Rewin stated that within three to five years, they would 
not be able to continue in their jobs without a certification.  Kumar went back to school and 
earned his PPS credential in December 2008, and presented it to the district in July 2009.  
(He delayed presenting it to the district to preserve his health benefits over the summer.) 

 
Like respondent Lee, Kumar contends that he is entitled to seniority for his classified 
service.  It is not clear that Kumar was required to obtain a PPS credential; giving employees 
“three to five years” to obtain a certification appears to be an expression of encouragement as 
opposed to a job requirement.  But, even if the district required Kumar to get a PPS 
credential, Kumar has not shown that the requirement was not based on statute or that it was  
not a bona fide occupational qualification.  Kumar’s assigned seniority date of August 19, 
2009, is correct.

School.  Her assigned seniority date is September 20, 2005.  She seeks an earlier seniority 
date based upon her work as a day-to-day substitute for the district during the 2004-2005 
school year, when she worked 183 days.  Under certain circumstances, an employee may 
tack on her earlier service as a substitute to establish an earlier seniority date, but that benefit 

Respondent Kathleen Ferdon is a literacy specialist at Paul Revere Elementary

does not apply to service rendered as a day-to-day substitute.  (Ed. Code, § 44918, subd. (d).)  
Ferdon’s assigned seniority date is correct. 
 

27. 

Respondent Noreen Abulencia is an elementary school teacher.  She 

challenges her assigned seniority date of August 23, 2006. 

 
Abulencia became a permanent tenured teacher in the district’s Child Development 
Program on February 12, 1992.  (Child Development Programs are described in Education 
Code section 8360 et seq.)  On August 12, 2006, pursuant to a provision in the collective 
bargaining agreement between UESF and the district, Abulencia transferred to the district’s 
K-12 program and became an elementary school teacher.  According to Abulencia, she was 
told by district staff that she would keep her 1992 seniority date when she transferred to the 
elementary school classroom, and she believes another child development teacher in her 
situation was allowed to do so.  However, she was assigned a new seniority date of August 
12, 2006.  She believes her seniority date should be February 12, 1992. 

 
In their briefs, the district, UESF, and Abulencia analyze the Education Code 
provisions that are relevant to Abulencia’s situation.  (UESF supports Abulencia’s claim.)  
None of the briefs, however, discusses San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen, supra, 144 
Cal.App.3d 627, which appears to be on point.  Eight of the appellants in Allen had 
transferred from the district’s child development program into the regular education program.  
The trial court concluded that their seniority commenced with their service in the regular 
education program, not the children’s center program.  The issue addressed by the court of 
appeal was “whether prior service in the children’s center program must be considered in 
fixing the first date of paid service in a probationary program.”  The court held that such 
service must be considered.  The court reasoned that the appellants were “permanent” 
employees within the meaning of Education Code section 44884 (now section 44929.21) 
because children’s center employees serve in positions requiring certification qualifications.  
As permanent employees, their seniority is measured from the date they first rendered paid 
service to the district in a probationary position.  Therefore, the court held, the appellants’ 
probationary service in the children’s center must be counted in determining their seniority. 

 
It follows from the court’s holding in Allen that Abulencia’s assigned seniority date of 

28. 

August 12, 2006, is incorrect.  Her seniority date should be the date she first rendered paid 
service to the district’s Child Development Program in a probationary position.  It is not clear 
whether that date is February 12, 1992, or an earlier date.  The district will be ordered to 
review its records and determine the correct date.

assigned a seniority date of August 19, 2009.  From 2004 to 2009 Noceda taught at a charter 
school in the district.  He contends that he is entitled to tack on his earlier charter school 
teaching experience to establish an earlier seniority date.  Noceda offers no authority for his

contention, and none has been found.  As noted above, a teacher’s seniority commences on 
the date he “first rendered paid service in a probationary position.”  (Ed. Code, § 44845.)  
Charter schools, however, are not subject to this provision, as they are generally exempt from 
the laws governing school districts.  (Ed. Code, § 47610.)  The evidence does not establish 
that Noceda’s assigned seniority date is incorrect. 
 
Core Substitutes 
 

30. 

The PKS resolution proposes to eliminate 15.0 FTE in Core Substitute 

Services.  This represents all or substantially all of the Core Substitute positions.  (The 
number of Core Substitutes is not clear from the evidence: UESF asserts that there are 15, 
while one district document appears to state that there are 16.)  There is a case pending in the 
court of appeal in which the district and UESF are litigating the proper classification of Core 
Substitutes.  For the sole purpose of administering the present layoff proceeding, however, 
the district and UESF stipulate that the Core Substitutes shall be treated as probationary 
employees. 

31. 

The district has classified certain certificated employees as temporary 

 
UESF asserts that the effect of this stipulation is that Core Substitutes are “by and 
large immune from layoff because of their seniority.”  The Core Substitutes, however, are 
probationary employees in a service that the district has chosen to substantially reduce or 
eliminate entirely.  They are not immune from layoff.  In this proceeding, no Core Substitute 
has asserted the right to bump a junior employee, or claimed that he or she has been 
improperly denied that right. 
 
Classification issues 
 
 
employees.  Temporary employees are not entitled to the due process protections afforded by 
Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.  (Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma County Union 
High School Dist. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 916-918.)  The district, however, sent 
“precautionary” layoff notices to temporary employees in the event any such employee 
wished to challenge his or her classification.  The respondents classified by the district as 
temporary are identified on the district’s Exhibit 11.  (Exhibit 11 was created before the 
district and UESF stipulated that Core Substitutes would be treated as probationary 
employees; pursuant to the parties’ stipulation, any Core Substitutes identified on Exhibit 11 
are probationary, not temporary employees, for the purpose of this layoff.)  
 
 
Respondent Jean-Pierre Ryan De Oliveira first came to work for the district in 
August 2009 as a coordinator in the “GEAR UP” program, a federally-funded program that 
encourages middle and high school students to go to college.  The district classified De 
Oliveira as a temporary employee in a categorically-funded program.  (Ed. Code, § 44909.)  
The district has chosen not to renew De Oliveira’s contract because of cutbacks in the GEAR 
UP program. 
 

32. 

 

14

De Oliveira contends that he cannot be terminated because, although there may be 

 
cutbacks in GEAR UP, the program has not been completely eliminated.  De Oliveira relies 
on Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Assn. v. Bakersfield City School Dist. (2006) 145 
Cal.App.4th 1260, to support his argument, but his reliance is misplaced.  In Bakersfield , the 
court found that certain employees in categorically-funded programs had been misclassified.   
Because of that misclassification, they were entitled to be treated as probationary employees 
and could not be laid off unless the funding for their programs ended.  In this case, however, 
the evidence fails to establish that De Oliveira was misclassified.  He is a temporary 
employee.  De Oliveira can be released whether or not the funding for GEAR UP continues.  
He is not entitled to the protections of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. 
 

33. 

Respondent Cheryl McDavid was hired as a physical education teacher under 

34. 

a temporary contract for the 2009-2010 school year.  Like De Oliveira, McDavid contends 
that she should be treated as a probationary employee and she relies upon the same legal 
authority.  As in De Oliveira’s case, the evidence fails to establish that McDavid was 
misclassified as a temporary employee.  She is not entitled to the protections of Education 
Code sections 44949 and 44955. 
 
 
Respondent Jennifer Kennedy was hired under a temporary contract for the 
2009-2010 school year after previous employment with the district as a day-to-day and a 
long-term substitute.  Kennedy does not contend that she was misclassified, and the evidence 
failed to establish that she was misclassified. 
 
 
 
Other matters 
 

35.  No other temporary employees challenged their classification. 

36. 

The cause for the reduction in particular kinds of services relates to the welfare 

of the schools and the pupils thereof. 

 
37. 

 
38. 

 

Except as otherwise permitted by statute, no permanent employee is being 

terminated while any probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is 
being retained to render a service which the permanent employee is certificated and 
competent to render. 

 Any contentions raised by respondents and not discussed above have been  

found to be without merit and are hereby rejected. 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

 
 
By reason of the matters set forth in Finding 27, cause exists to require the 
district to change the August 23, 2006 seniority date it has assigned to respondent Noreen 
Abulencia, and to verify her correct seniority date. 
 

 

15

2. 

By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 31 through 35, the employees 

identified on the district’s Exhibit 11 (with the exception of Core Substitutes) are temporary 
employees.  Because the provisions of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 apply only 
to probationary and permanent employees, they are not entitled to the protections afforded by 
those sections and it is not necessary to decide whether there is cause for not reemploying 
them for the 2010-2011 school year.  The district may, but is not required to, give them 
notice that their services will not be required for the 2010-2011 school year. 

As to the remaining respondents, cause exists because of the reduction or 

elimination of particular kinds of services pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 
44955 to give notice to respondents in 665 FTE positions (163 FTE in administrative 
services and 502 FTE in instructional services) that their services will not be required for the 
2010-2011 school year.  The cause relates solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils 
thereof within the meaning of Education Code section 44949.
