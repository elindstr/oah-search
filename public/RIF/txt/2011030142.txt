Ms. Areola is Not Entitled to Participate in the Layoff Hearing

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

The district served a precautionary Preliminary Layoff Notice on Cristina

Areola, and she requested a hearing. Ms. Areola, however, is a school psychologist and is
part of the district’s management staff. Ms. Areola’s contract specifies that it is for an
“administrative position.” A personnel action form specifies that the position is a certificated
management position, and it calls for Ms. Areola to work 195 days per year, which is a
management schedule; teachers work 185 days per year. Ms. Areola’s salary is from the
management scale. The district provides management training for the management staff, and
Ms. Areola attends the management training sessions.

2.

It is found that Ms. Areola is part of the district’s management staff. As such,

she is not entitled to participate in this layoff proceeding.

General Findings Concerning Statutory Requirements

3.

Education Code sections 44949 and 44955,4 provide for two notices to be

given in connection with terminating certificated employees. The first notice, which will be
referred to as the Preliminary Layoff Notice, is given by the superintendent. It is given to the
governing board and to the employees the superintendent recommends for layoff. The
Preliminary Layoff Notice gives the board and the employees notice that the superintendent
recommends that those employees be laid off. The superintendent must give the Preliminary

4 All references to the Code are to the Education Code unless otherwise specified.

2

Layoff Notice no later than March 15. There is no requirement that a governing board take
any action in March. But while it is unnecessary, governing boards usually adopt a
resolution ratifying the superintendent’s recommendations.

4.

The second notice is a notice of a governing board’s decision to terminate an
employee. That notice is provided for in Section 44955 and must be given before May 15.
That notice advises a teacher that the district will not require his or her services for the
ensuing school year. That notice will be referred to as a Termination Notice.

5.

In this case, not later than March 15, 2011, the superintendent notified the

governing board and the respondents that he recommended that the respondents not be
retained for the ensuing school year.

The Preliminary Layoff Notice stated the reasons for the recommendation.

The recommendation was not related to respondents’ competency.

A Preliminary Layoff Notice was delivered to each respondent, either by

personal delivery or by depositing the notice in the United States mail, registered, postage
prepaid, and addressed to respondent’s last known address.

6.

7.

8.

The Preliminary Layoff Notice advised each respondent as follows: He or she
had a right to a hearing. In order to obtain a hearing, he or she had to deliver a request for a
hearing in writing to the person sending the notice. The request had to be delivered by a
specified date, which was a date that was not less than seven days after the notice was
served.5 And the failure to request a hearing would constitute a waiver of the right to a
hearing.

9.

Respondents either timely filed written requests for a hearing or obtained a

waiver of their failure to file. An accusation was timely served on respondents. Respondents
were given notice that, if they were going to request a hearing, they were required to file a
notice of defense within five days after being served with the accusation.6 Respondents
either filed timely notices of defense or obtained a waiver of their failure to file. All
prehearing jurisdictional requirements were either met or waived.

5 Employees must be given at least seven days in which to file a request for a hearing.
Education Section 44949, subdivision (b), provides that the final date for filing a request for
a hearing “shall not be less than seven days after the date on which the notice is served upon
the employee.”

6 Pursuant to Government Section 11506, a party on whom an accusation is served

must file a notice of defense in order to obtain a hearing. Education Section 44949,
subdivision (c)(1), provides that, in teacher termination cases, the notice of defense must be
filed within five days after service of the accusation.

3

10.

The governing board of the district resolved to reduce or discontinue particular
kinds of services. Within the meaning of Section 44955, the services are “particular kinds of
services” that can be reduced or discontinued. The decision to reduce or discontinue these
services was not arbitrary or capricious but constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

Services the District Intends to Reduce or Discontinue

11.

The governing board of the district determined that, because particular kinds

of services are to be reduced or discontinued, it is necessary to decrease the number of
permanent or probationary employees in the district by 357 full time equivalents (FTE).

12.

The particular kinds of services the governing board of the district resolved to

reduce or discontinue are:

Services

Number of Full-Time
Equivalent Positions

K-6 General Education Teachers

328

Associate Principals

Part-Time Program Support Teachers

Resource Teachers

Total Full-Time Equivalent Reduction

357

Notice to be Rescinded

13.

The district stipulated that it will rescind the Preliminary Layoff Notice served
on Noemi Talamante, who is a special education teacher. The reduction in force concerning
special education teachers is separate from the reduction concerning general education
teachers; therefore, the rescission will have no effect on the calculations regarding the
general education teachers.

Tie-Breaking Criteria Based on the Current Needs of the District and Students

14.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (b), the governing board of the district

adopted criteria for determining the order of termination as among employees who first
rendered paid service on the same day. Section 44955, subdivision (b), requires a district to
adopt such criteria and provides that the criteria are to be based on “needs of the district and
the students . . . .” The district’s tie-breaking criteria are as follows:

DETERMINATION OF TIE-BREAKING CRITERIA FOR
2011-12

Pursuant to provisions of Education Code Section 44955, the
Board of Education is required to determine the District’s needs
should it become necessary to determine the order of
termination for certificated employees who first rendered paid
service to the District on the same day.

For the 2011-12 school year only, to meet the requirements of
the Board of Education
Education Code Section 44955,
determines the needs of the District and the students by
establishing the following tie-breaking criteria.

The following rating system shall be applied in determining the
order of termination of certificated employees:

Criteria

Ratings

BCLAD or its equivalent.

+4 points

Number of supplementary
authorizations

+1 point per supplementary
authorization

Number of teaching and/or
services credentials

+1 point per credential

TIE-BREAKING PROCEDURE

In the event that common-day hires have equal qualifications
based on application of the above criteria, the District will then
break ties by utilizing a lottery.

15.

The district did not find it necessary to use the tie-breaking criteria.

District’s Intention to Deviate from Seniority (Skipping)

16.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), a district may deviate from

terminating employees in the order of seniority, i.e., a district may skip over teachers with a
particular qualification and terminate more senior teachers who do not possess that
qualification. In order to skip, a district must demonstrate a specific need for personnel to
teach a specific course or course of study or a specific need for personnel with a
specialization in personnel services or nursing. If the need concerns a course or course of
study, the district may skip a junior employee only if employees with more seniority do not
possess the special training and experience necessary to teach the course and only if the
junior employee does possess that special training and experience.

17.

The district identified one specific course of study, the dual immersion (DI)

classes, as creating a specific need for personnel.

18.

The board resolved as follows:

The criteria that will be applied to deviate from terminating
certificated employees who may otherwise be terminated by
order of seniority will be based on the criteria within Education
Code Section 44955(d):

(A)
Teachers of dual immersion classes constitute a special
and specific need in this District and shall be considered for this
purpose as personnel teaching a specific course or course of
study, and teachers teaching dual
immersion classes have
training and experience necessary to teach dual
special
immersion classes for purposes of Education Code Section
44955(d).

Pursuant to Education Code Section 35161, the Board

(B)
delegates to the District Superintendent and the Superintendent's
designee(s) further implementation and determination of
deviations from seniority in the order of termination of the
District's certificated employees as is necessary to meet the
needs of the District.

19.

Emma Sanchez, the Executive Director for Language Acquisition Services for
the district, testified about the DI program and the qualifications for teaching in it. She was a
very impressive witness. DI classes are provided for all grade levels. Students in those
classes study and learn in both Spanish and English. Some of the students are native
Spanish-speaking; some are native English-speaking. The program is designed to build
fluency in both Spanish and English. The program seeks to promote bilingualism, bi-
literacy, academic achievement, and multicultural awareness. Academic achievement is
stressed in language instruction as well as in the balance of the curriculum. There is a

6

particular need for this program in Chula Vista elementary schools because 9,000 students
are native Spanish-speakers. Those students comprise 35 percent of the student population.
Presently, 80 teachers provide this instruction.

20. Ms. Sanchez noted that, with native Spanish-speaking and native English-

speaking students integrated in the same classroom, students learn from each other.

21. Ms. Sanchez requires teachers to use what have been identified as “best

methods.” Teachers are expected to engage families and the community in the program.
Teachers must have the ability to teach in two languages with high proficiency. It is
essential that teachers be committed to the goals of the program. DI teachers must
thoroughly understand and know how to teach language transferability, which has to do with
the ways in which two or more languages are and are not similar. As a simple example, Ms.
Sanchez pointed to cognates, words in two languages that sound somewhat alike and mean
the same thing. DI teachers must know when there is transferability, when there is partial
transferability, and when there is no transferability.

22. Ms. Sanchez said there has been a demand to expand the program, and she

adds to the pool of teachers from time to time. Last year she added four new teachers.
Those teachers had not had previous DI teaching experience. Ms. Sanchez said she prefers
teachers who have had previous experience teaching DI.

23.

A certification to teach English language learners, i.e., a certification such as

BCLAD, is required of all teachers in the program. Such certification, however, does not
necessarily cause a teacher to be qualified to teach DI. Most teachers who are certified to
teach English language learners are not qualified to teach DI.

24.

It is found that the district has demonstrated a specific need for personnel to

teach in the DI program. It is further found that special training and experience are necessary
to teach that course of study.

Ms. Camarena’s Special Training and Experience

25.

Sandra Camarena holds a multiple subject credential. She is bilingual in

Spanish and English and is certified to teach English language learners. She has a seniority
date of October 8, 2007. Ms. Camarena was present during Ms. Sanchez’s testimony
concerning the qualifications required of a DI teacher. Ms. Camarena testified that she heard
Ms. Sanchez’s description of the qualifications and that she could teach in the DI program.
She said that, when she was in college at San Jose State in 2006, she learned to teach all
subjects in Spanish and English. She said she has transferability skills. During the current
school year, Ms. Camarena participated in three one-day trainings regarding language
acquisition. She and one other teacher in her school were designated to take the training and
then share it with other teachers at their school. Four years ago, Ms. Camarena taught
Spanish language acquisition in a transitional bilingual program at South Bay Union School.
In 1986, she taught language acquisition to English-speaking adults. Ms. Camarena was a

7

very credible witness. Her testimony was succinct and clear. She appeared to be sincere and
competent.

26.

The board’s resolution does not identify any special training or experience that

is necessary to teach in the DI program. In that regard, the resolution provides only that,
“[T]eachers teaching dual immersion classes have special training and experience necessary
to teach dual immersion . . . .” And Ms. Camarena’s testimony supports a conclusion that
she has the special training and experience necessary to fill the position Ms. Sanchez
described.

27.

It is found that Ms. Camarena proved that she has the special training and

experience necessary to teach in the DI program. She had the burden of proof on that matter,
but she presented sufficient evidence to cause the burden to shift to the complainant. Ms.
Sanchez was present during Ms. Camarena’s testimony. If complainant believed there was
evidence that Ms. Camarena does not have the necessary training or experience, complainant
could have recalled Ms. Sanchez to testify to that effect.

28.

The most junior DI teacher on whom the district served a precautionary

Preliminary Layoff Notice is Blanca Hernandez-Stingl, whose date of hire is July 20, 2010.
As noted above, Ms. Camarena’s date of hire is October 8, 2007. The district may not
terminate Ms. Camarena while retaining Ms. Hernandez-Stingl to perform a service for
which Ms. Camarena possesses the necessary special training and experience.

Right to be Retained According to Seniority and Qualifications – Date of Hire

33.

Job security is not inherent in seniority. The Legislature chose to provide

teachers with limited job security according to their seniority.

34.

There was no evidence that any teacher’s date of hire was other than the date

recorded on the district’s seniority list.

8

Right to be Retained According to Seniority and Qualifications –Bumping

35.

The second paragraph of section 44955, subdivision (c), does not add to

teachers’ seniority rights. It does, however, make it clear that governing boards must make
assignments in such a way as to protect seniority rights. Employees must be retained to
render any service their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render. Thus, if a senior
teacher whose regular assignment is being eliminated is certificated and competent to teach a
junior teacher’s courses, the district must retain the senior teacher and reassign him or her to
render that service. This is commonly referred to as bumping. The district must either
reassign or terminate the junior employee.

36.

The board adopted competency criteria, as follows:

Subject to requirements (if any) within the Educational
Employment Relations Act that for purposes of “bumping”
(displacement) rights and the determination of “competency”
within the meaning of Education Code Section 44955(b) to the
extent such might apply, “competency” shall be based upon
possession and current filing (no later than March 1, 2011) of a
preliminary or clear credential for the subject matter to which
the employee would bump; see also sections 8 and 9 below,
which are incorporated into this section 4.

[¶] . . . [¶]

In selecting those probationary and permanent certificated
employees who shall receive notices of termination pursuant to
this resolution, Education Code Section 44955(d) allows the
Board to deviate from terminating a certificated employee in
order of seniority.

The criteria that will be applied to deviate from terminating
certificated employees who may otherwise be terminated by
order of seniority will be based on the criteria within Education
Code Section 44955(d):

Teachers of dual immersion classes constitute a special
(A)
and specific need in this District and shall be considered for this
purpose as personnel teaching a specific course or course of
study, and teachers teaching dual
immersion classes have
training and experience necessary to teach dual
special
immersion classes for purposes of Education Code Section
44955(d).

Pursuant to Education Code Section 35161, the Board

(B)
delegates to the District Superintendent and the Superintendent's
designee(s) further implementation and determination of
deviations from seniority in the order of termination of the
District's certificated employees as is necessary to meet the
needs of the District.

Mandated Services

37.

State and federal laws mandate that certain services be provided at or above
mandated levels. There was no evidence that the district is reducing those services below
mandated levels.

The K-6 General Education Teachers

38.

Sandra Villegas-Zúñiga, Assistant Superintendant for Human Resources,

testified regarding the resolution and the notices that were sent to teachers. The following is
a paraphrased summary of part of her testimony concerning the K-6 general education
teachers.

39.

K-6 General Education Teachers include teachers who teach in the DI program

and teachers who do not teach in that program. With regard to the proposed layoffs, the
district treated those two groups differently. Also, as noted above, the board treated part-
time program support teachers, resource teachers, and site resource teachers as separate
categories for purposes of specifying the FTE positions to be reduced for each one.

40. Ms. Villegas-Zúñiga served regular, i.e., not merely precautionary,
Preliminary Layoff Notices on 245.74 FTE general education teachers who do not teach in
the DI program.

41.

Because of bumping, Ms. Villegas-Zúñiga served regular Preliminary Layoff

Notices on an additional 10.65 FTE general education teachers who do not teach in the DI
program. One FTE resulted from a general education teacher bumping into a position held
by a junior general education teacher. Three resulted from assistant principals bumping into
general education positions. One resulted from a resource teacher bumping into a general
education position. Another 5.65 resulted from site resource teachers bumping into general
education positions.

42.

Thus, 245.74 FTE and 10.65 FTE notices were served on general education

teachers who do not teach in the DI program, a total of 256.39 FTE.

43.

In addition to serving 5.65 FTE on general education teachers because of site

resource teachers bumping into general education positions, Ms. Villegas-Zúñiga served
Preliminary Layoff Notices on 2.41 FTE site resource teachers. As noted above, the board
authorized a reduction of only six FTE site resource teacher positions. Thus, the total

10

reduction of site resource teachers exceeded the authorization by 2.06 FTE. Because the
senior site resource teachers had bumping rights and bumped into general education teaching
positions, that resulted in an unauthorized over-noticing of general education teachers by
2.06 FTE. Ms. Steiner, on behalf of her clients, stipulated that, for purposes of making an
adjustment, the number could be rounded to 2 FTE. Complainant’s counsel, on behalf of
complainant, stipulated that the FTEs to be reduced should be decreased by 2 FTE.

44. Ms. Steiner’s stipulation with regard to rounding off the .06 FTE has no effect
on the DI teachers because they are being skipped. It has no effect on Mr. Espino, who has a
date of hire of July 27, 2006, and no effect on Ms. Larsen, who has a date of hire of July 19,
2004.

45.

Thus, pursuant to stipulation, the 256.39 FTE must be decreased by 2 FTE,
which leaves a reduction in staff of 254.39 FTE of general education teachers who do not
teach DI. This adjustment results in the district’s being permitted to serve termination
notices on 2.41 FTE site resource teachers.

46. Ms. Villegas-Zúñiga testified that between March 15 and April 7, 2011,
approximately 55 teachers gave notices that they would be retiring at the end of the current
school year. The seniority list was revised on April 4, 2011, and using that list, Ms. Villegas-
Zúñiga was able to positively identify a number of those teachers. She identified 30 teachers
from the K-6 general education program who will be retiring and whose retirement has not
yet been considered as satisfying the need to reduce services. Thus, the 254.39 FTE should
be further decreased by 30, which leaves 224.39 FTE general education teachers who were
served regular Preliminary Layoff Notices who may be terminated.

Summary of Findings Regarding Retention of Employees

47. With the above modifications, it is the case that, with regard to respondents

who are permanent employees, the district is not retaining any probationary employee to
render a service that such a respondent is certificated and competent to render.

48. With the above modifications, it is the case that, with regard to respondents

who are permanent employees, the district is not retaining any employee with less seniority
than such a respondent has to render a service that the respondent is certificated and
competent to render.7

49. With the above modifications, it is the case that, with regard to respondents

who are either permanent or probationary employees, the district is not retaining any

employee in terms of the services the employee is “certificated and competent to render.”

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

General Conclusions

1.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Sections 44949 and 44955. Except as

noted above, all notice and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were
satisfied.

2.

Within the terms of Sections 44949 and 44955, the district has cause to reduce

or discontinue particular kinds of services and to give Termination Notices to certain
respondents. The cause relates solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils.

Skipping

3.

Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), provides, in part, that a district may deviate
from terminating teachers according to seniority if the “district demonstrates a specific need
for personnel to teach a specific course” and demonstrates that a junior “employee has
special training and experience necessary to teach that course . . . which others with more
seniority do not possess.”

4.

By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 17 through 24, it is determined

that the district demonstrated a specific need for personnel to teach in the DI program and
demonstrated that special training and experience are necessary to teach that course of study.

Conclusions Regarding Ms. Camarena

5.

Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), requires that a district satisfy two conditions

before it can consider skipping a junior employee. First, a district must demonstrate a
specific need for personnel to teach a specific course. Second, a district must demonstrate
that employees with more seniority do not have the special training and experience necessary
to teach that course. Until a district demonstrates both of those things, there is no reason to
consider whether a junior employee has the special training and experience necessary to
teach the course. Whether a junior employee has the special training and experience
necessary to teach the course is irrelevant unless a district has demonstrated that employees
with more seniority do not have the special training and experience necessary to teach it.

8 Section 44955, subdivision (c), provides seniority protection for both permanent and

probationary employees in terms of the services an employee’s “qualifications entitle [him
or her] to render.”

12

6.

In Bledsoe v. Biggs (2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 127, the third appellate district

dealt with a skipping issue. Bledsoe was senior to teachers who were skipped. Bledsoe
contended he had the special training and experience necessary to teach the course for which
the junior teachers were retained. The court did not read Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1),
as requiring one to first dispose of the issue of whether a senior teacher has the special
training and experience necessary. The court first found that Bledsoe had, at least, the
minimal training and experience necessary to teach the course. The court then reviewed the
junior teachers’ special training and experience and found that the junior teachers had special
training and experience necessary to teach the course. Finally, the court reviewed Bledsoe’s
special training and experience and found that he did not have the special training and
experience that the junior teachers had. The court said, “This evidence supports the finding
that Bledsoe does not possess the special training and experience that Gates and Sormano
possess.” (Bledsoe, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at pp. 135 - 142.)

7.

There is an ambiguity in the court’s conclusion that “Bledsoe does not possess

the special training and experience that Gates and Sormano possess.” Immediately prior to
that, the court found that “Gates and Sormano have the ‘special training and experience
necessary to teach’ [the course.]” (Bledsoe, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 142.) Thus, the
court’s conclusion concerning Bledsoe could be taken to mean that he did not possess the
special training and experience necessary to teach the course. And if the conclusion
concerning Bledsoe is read that way, it is perfectly consistent with the requirements of
Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1).

8.

If, on the other hand, one reads the court’s conclusion concerning Bledsoe as

meaning only that he did not have as much special training and experience as Gates and
Sormano had, the court failed to make an essential finding. Before a district may skip a
junior teacher, section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), requires the district to demonstrate that
personnel “with more seniority do not possess” the “special training and experience
necessary to teach [the] course . . . .”

9.

A district may not use specified periods of experience in its skipping criteria

simply to secure continuity in a position. Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), allows a district
to maintain continuity in a position only if the district demonstrates that employees with
more seniority do not have the special training and experience necessary to fill the position.

10.

The rule-making authority conferred on the governing boards of school

districts is limited to the adoption of rules not in conflict with other statutory restrictions.
(Patton v. Governing Board (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 495, 501. “The governing board of each
school district shall prescribe and enforce rules not inconsistent with law, or with the rules
prescribed by the State Board of Education, for its own government.” (Section 35010, subd.
(b).) Administrative regulations that alter or amend a statute or enlarge or impair its scope
are void. (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379,
1389.) These rules apply to dismissal of tenured teachers. “[I]t is the function of the
governing board of each district to suspend, demote or dismiss employees” as provided by
statute. “To the extent [any rule or regulation] is contrary to these statutory provisions, it is

13

void, for an administrative agency has no authority to enact rules or regulations which alter
or enlarge the terms of legislative enactments.” (California Sch. Employees Assn. v.
Personnel Commission (1970) 3 Cal.3d 139, 143-144)

11.

Administrative practices that circumvent valid expectations of reemployment

created by the tenure statutes are not permitted. (Balen v. Peralta Junior College Dist.
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 821, 830-831; Santa Barbara Federation of Teachers v. Santa Barbara
High School Dist. (1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 223, 230.)

12.

Layoffs must proceed in accordance with the procedures prescribed by statute,

which are to be strictly followed. (Greer v. Board of Education (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 98,
105.)

13.

Because subdivision (b) of section 44955 mandates that “the services of no

permanent employee may be terminated . . . while any probationary employee, or any other
employee with less seniority, is retained to render a service which said permanent employee
is certificated and competent to render,” junior employees may be given retention priority
pursuant to section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), only if they possess special training and
experience that their more senior counterparts lack. (Alexander v. Board of Trustees (1983)
139 Cal.App.3d 567, 571; Moreland Teachers Assn. v. Kurze (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 648,
655.)

14.

In interpreting the meaning of a statute, words must be given the meaning they

bear in ordinary usage. (In re Rojas (1979) 23 Cal.3d 152, 155.) The meaning of an
enactment should not be determined from a single word or sentence; the words must be
construed in context, and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized
to the extent possible. (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) 43
Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387; Title Ins. & Trust Co. v. County of Riverside (1989) 48 Cal.3d 84,
91.)

15.

The “special training and experience necessary” language in section 44955,

subdivision (d)(1), must be read in context with 44955, subdivision (b). When one does that,
it appears that the word “necessary” substantially limits 44955, subdivision (d)(1). A district
may require special training and special experience, but a district cannot require more of
either than is “necessary” to teach the course. If “necessary” were not read in that limiting
way, 44955, subdivision (d)(1), could be used to circumvent the seniority rights secured by
44955, subdivision (b). On the other hand, reading “necessary” in that limiting way
harmonizes the language of the two subdivisions.

16.

Thus, a district may not use skipping criteria that are not “necessary” to teach

a course. Requiring a certain type of experience or a certain length of experience may be
appropriate but only if it is shown to be “necessary.” There are a few decisions in which
courts have approved of a requirement of prior experience. Martin v. Kingfield School
District (1983) 35 Cal.3d 294, is an example. The case concerned the section 44956
preferred right of reappointment. An elementary school teacher who had been terminated

14

asserted her right to be rehired to fill a new position as a middle school science teacher, a
position for which she was credentialed. The district established a requirement of prior
experience as a middle school teacher and did not rehire Martin for the position. The case
stands for the proposition that a district, in requiring prior middle school experience for a
middle school science position, did not abuse its discretion.

17.

Skipping a junior teacher and terminating a senior teacher instead of

terminating the junior teacher is such a fundamental departure from the tenure system that
the legislature’s limitation of “necessary” should be strictly respected. A district should be
allowed to terminate a senior teacher for not having “necessary” experience only if the
experience actually is “necessary.” Here Ms. Sanchez testified that she prefers teachers who
have past experience teaching DI; she did not testify that past experience is necessary.

18.

By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 17 through 27, it is determined

that Ms. Camarena possesses the special training and experience necessary to teach in the DI
program. The most junior DI teacher to whom the district sent a precautionary Preliminary
Layoff Notice is Blanca Hernandez-Stingl. It may be that Ms. Hernandez-Stingl is well
qualified to teach in the DI program, but because Ms. Camarena possesses the special
training and experience necessary for the position, Ms. Hernandez-Stingl’s qualifications are
not relevant.

19.

The district may serve a Notice of Termination on Ms. Hernandez-Stingl. The

accusation against Ms. Camarena must be dismissed.

Attrition

20. Must a district consider positively assured attrition in deciding how many
employees’ services are subject to termination? Subdivision (b) of section 44955 of the
Code provides that, when a school district has experienced a decline in its average daily
attendance or when a particular kind of service is to be reduced or eliminated, “and when in
the opinion of the governing board . . . it shall have become necessary by reason of any of
these conditions to decrease the number of permanent employees in the district, the
governing board may terminate the services of not more than a corresponding percentage of
the certificated employees of the district . . . .” (Italics added.) In Burgess v. Board of
Education9 the court held that “normal attrition” must be used to offset layoffs justified by a
decline in ADA since ignoring such attrition “results in a reduction in force not necessarily
required by decline in average daily attendance.” Two years later, citing Burgess, the court
in Lewin v. Board of Trustees10 held that, “because the number of employees may be reduced
only when it is ‘necessary’ to do so, the governing board must consider normal attrition in

9 (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 571, at 579.

10 (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 977, at 980-983.

15

the work force as a part of any reduction in employment.”11 (Italics added.) Reasoning that
“[b]oard members are not soothsayers,” the court held that a district must consider only
“positively assured attrition,” that is, attrition known to the board by the time of its final
determination on or before May 15. A district need not consider “potential attrition,” that is,
retirements and resignations that are expected to occur before the beginning of the next
school year.

21. Moreland Teachers Association v. Kurze,12 concerned notices that cited both

ADA and PKS as the grounds for termination. In discussing, the attrition issue, however, the
court focused on the ADA ground. In calculating the number of employees to be laid off, the
school district had considered attrition occurring before the initial notice date of March 15.
The respondents contended that the district was required to consider attrition occurring
between March 15 and May 15, also. The district contended that it was not required to do
that. In Moreland, the court elaborated on the Lewin holding.

Acknowledging actual attrition occurring between March 15 and
May 15 to reduce the number of employees to be laid off results
in no prejudice to the school district, while sparing that number
of employees unnecessary termination of employment.

We see no legal or practical impediment to revising downward
the number of needed terminations resulting from events
occurring in the intervening two months. On the contrary, there
is sound reason to do so, as otherwise the reduction in force for
the ensuing school year would be greater than that necessitated
by the decline in attendance.13

A board’s decision as to reduction or discontinuation of a
particular kind of service is not tied in with any statistical
computation, such as reduction in the number of students. The
number of terminations made necessary by PKS reductions
depends totally upon the district’s decision as to how many
services to reduce. Put another way, the language of section
44955 that the governing board of a school district “may
terminate the services of not more than a corresponding

22.

In San Jose v. Allen, the case on which complainant relies, the court held that a

school district is not required to consider attrition in a PKS layoff.

11 Id. at p. 980.

13 Id. at p. 654.

12 (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 648.

16

percentage of the certificated employees of said district” is only
applicable to ADA terminations based upon an actual reduction
in attendance. Where the governing board determines to
discontinue or reduce a particular kind of service, there is no
way to calculate a “corresponding percentage,” hence it is
within the discretion of the board to determine the amount by
which it will reduce a particular service.

[¶] . . . [¶]

In PKS cases the determination of the amount by which a
service is to be reduced is the determination of the number of
positions to be eliminated.

… In making a final decision on PKS reductions, the extent to
which the services are reduced inherently determines the
number of positions to remain. If a service is to be eliminated,
for example, it is obvious that it is unnecessary to consider
attrition in any way.14

23.

In deciding that a school district is not required to consider attrition in a PKS
layoff, the San Jose court focused on only part of the language of subdivision (b) of section
44955. The court focused on the provision that “[T]he governing board may terminate the
services of not more than a corresponding percentage of the certificated employees in the
district.” And, as the court said, that language can apply only to ADA terminations. When a
governing board decides to discontinue or reduce a particular kind of service, there is no way
to calculate a “corresponding percentage.” But the court was mistaken in concluding that it
follows that it is unnecessary to consider attrition in PKS cases. The court was mistaken,
because other language in subdivision (b) should be considered. In both ADA and PKS
cases, employees’ services may be terminated only when termination has “become
necessary” and only when that necessity is “by reason of” the ADA or PKS condition. In an
ADA termination, employees’ services may be terminated only when, in the opinion of the
governing board, decreasing the number of permanent employees has “become necessary by
reason of” the ADA condition. Similarly, in a PKS termination, employees’ services may be
terminated only when, in the opinion of the governing board, decreasing the number of
permanent employees has “become necessary by reason of” the PKS condition. In the San
Jose case, the court focused solely on the number of positions to be reduced and on the
“corresponding percentage” language. The court did not consider whether the loss of a
certain number of positions would, in all cases, cause it to “become necessary” to terminate
the services of an equal number of employees.

14 San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen, 144 Cal.App.3d at pp. 635-636.

17

24.

Consider the following illustration. Assume that a district with six full-time

music teachers decides to reduce music for the following school year from six to three FTE.
Because of that reduction, the three most junior music teachers would be laid off. It is true,
as the San Jose court held, that the reduction from six to three positions would not be
affected in any way by, for example, the May 10 retirement of a music teacher. For the
following school year the district would still be offering only half as many music courses as
it does in the current school year. But that retirement would mean that the PKS condition no
longer made it necessary to decrease the number of employees by three. After the
retirement, it would be necessary to decrease the number of employees only by two. The
decrease regarding the third position would be accounted for by attrition.

25.

In both ADA and PKS layoffs, the words of the Moreland court hold true. A

consideration of attrition results in no prejudice to the district and spares some employees
from unnecessary termination. And not to consider attrition would result in a greater
decrease in the number of employees than the condition necessitates.

26.

The only attrition that must be considered is attrition that creates a vacancy in

a position in which a permanent employee would be qualified to serve.

27.

In the San Jose case, the court said that whether a school district is required to
consider attrition in a PKS layoff was “an issue of first impression.”15 The court noted that
courts in other cases had held that a school district is required to consider attrition in an ADA
layoff. One of the cases the San Jose court cited as being limited to ADA layoffs was Lewin.
But in fact, Lewin concerned both ADA and PKS. The Lewin court said, “In March 1974,
following a two-year decline in attendance and in light of planned reductions in services, the
board decided not to re-employ 171 certificated employees.” (Italics added.)

28.

As noted above, the Lewin court held:

Because the number of employees may be reduced only when it
is “necessary” to do so, the governing board must consider
normal attrition in the work force as a part of any reduction in
employment.16 (Italics added.)

29.

Thus, the Lewin court, in a case that concerned both ADA and PKS layoffs,

held that a school district is required to consider attrition.

30.

The San Jose court mistakenly read Lewin as not being a PKS case. Lewin
was decided by Division Two of the Second Appellate District of the court. San Jose was
decided by Division Five of the First Appellate District of the court. Thus, it appears there is
a disagreement between those districts as to whether a school district is required to consider

15 Id. at p. 635.

16 62 Cal.App.3d at p. 980.

18

attrition in a PKS layoff. And it is determined that the Lewin decision is more faithful to the
language of section 44955 and should be followed.

31.

In the present case, the board resolution calls for a reduction of 357 FTE

positions. That figure, however, is substantially higher than the reduction the district actually
is seeking. From Ms. Villegas-Zúñiga’s testimony, it was clear that a reduction of that size
would far exceed what is needed to account for the worst case anticipated budget shortfall.
Governing boards have great discretion in deciding what services to eliminate or reduce and
great discretion in deciding the extent of a reduction. But substantially overstating the
reduction being sought should not be used as a reason to ignore positively assured attrition.
Also, the board’s figure includes 31.97 FTE of DI teachers whom the board actually is
seeking to skip rather than terminate. The figure also includes six psychologists whom the
board included only as a precaution. In the present case, the number of FTE positions the
district is seeking to reduce is more accurately reflected in the Preliminary Layoff Notices
Ms. Villegas-Zúñiga served than it is in the resolution. As noted above, regarding general
education teachers who do not teach in the DI program, she served Preliminary Layoff
Notices regarding 245.74 FTE and an additional 10.65 because of bumping. She also served
2.41 FTE site resource teachers who teach in the general education program and 1.2 FTE
part-time program support teachers who teach in the general education program.

32.

By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 39 through 46, it is determined

that, within the terms of sections 44949 and 44955 of the Code, the district has cause to
reduce or discontinue 224.39 FTE of K-6 general education teachers – except that the district
must reduce that number to the extent there is additional positively assured attrition that
creates vacancies in positions in which permanent employees would be qualified to serve.

Cause Exists to Terminate Certain Respondents

33. Within the terms of sections 44949 and 44955 of the Code, the district has

cause to reduce or discontinue the following services:

224.39 FTE of K-6 general education teachers.

One FTE associate principal.

1.2 FTE part-time program support teachers.

2.41 FTE site resource teachers.

Two FTE special education teachers.

34. With regard to each of the above, the district must reduce the number to the
extent there is additional positively assured attrition that creates vacancies in positions in
which permanent employees would be qualified to serve.
