BEFORE THE GOVERNING BOARD
OF THE BUENA PARK SCHOOL DISTRICT
STATE OF CALIFORNIA

In the Matter of the Accusations Against:

CERTAIN CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES,

OAH No. 2011030824

Respondents.

PROPOSED DECISION

Daniel Juárez, Administrative Law Judge, Office of Administrative Hearings, heard

this matter on April 7, 2011, in Buena Park, California.

Atkinson, Andelson, Loya, Ruud & Romo and Aaron V. O’Donnell, represented the

Buena Park School District (BPSD).

Reich, Adell, Crost & Cvitan and Carlos Perez, represented Eva Araujo, Angela

Beucler, Mary Biner, Felicia Clark, Katherine Del Re, Catherine Hackett, Deborah
Hegstrom, Christine Kai, Leona Kendall, Steven Little, Laura Lucero, Christina Luckey,
Andrew Osborn, Tanya Samarin, Kristin Sherman, Rowyna Shiohama, and Andrienne Wood
(Respondents).

Respondent Mary Beckelheimer filed a request for hearing; however, and despite

being served with the jurisdictional documents, Respondent Beckelheimer failed to appear at
hearing. Respondents’ counsel did not assert representation of Respondent Beckelheimer.

The matter was deemed submitted for decision on April 7, 2011.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1(a). The parties stipulated to the allegations in the first five sections of the
Accusation. Consequently, that stipulation established the facts set forth in Factual Findings
1(b) through and including 1(e).

1(b). Greg Magnuson, BPSD Superintendent, filed the Accusations in his official

capacity.

1(c). Respondents are presently certificated employees of BPSD.

1(d). On March 7, 2011, the BPSD Governing Board (the Governing Board)
adopted Resolution 10-14 to reduce and discontinue particular kinds of certificated services
no later than the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year. The particular kinds of certificated

1

services total 32 full time equivalent (FTE) positions. The Governing Board further
determined that it was necessary because of those reductions or discontinuances to decrease
the number of certificated employees at the close of the present school year by a
corresponding number of FTE positions and directed the Superintendent to notify the
appropriate employees to implement the Governing Board’s determination.

1(e). By March 15, 2011, and pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and
44955, the Superintendent recommended to the Governing Board that it notify Respondents
that Respondents’ services will not be required for the ensuing school year, and inform
Respondents of the underlying reasons for such notification.

1(f). By March 15, 2011, the Governing Board notified Respondents of its

determination to terminate Respondents’ services for the ensuing school year and the
underlying reasons for termination, in accordance with Education Code sections 44949 and
44955.

In response to the written notice, each Respondent timely requested a hearing

to determine if there is cause to not reemploy him or her for the 2011-2012 school year.

BPSD served the Accusation and other required documents timely on each

Respondent.

All jurisdictional requirements were met.

Resolution number 10-14 reduces or discontinues 32 FTE positions for the

2010-2011 school year.

The 32 FTE positions at issue in this matter are particular kinds of services

that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.

The Governing Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the particular kinds

of services at issue in this matter was due to the anticipated decline in State funding; the
Governing Board’s decision was not arbitrary or capricious, but constituted a proper exercise
of discretion.

8.

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related to the

welfare of BPSD and its pupils. The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of BPSD, as
determined by the Governing Board.

9.

BPSD identified the certificated employees providing the particular kinds of

services that the Governing Board directed to be reduced or discontinued.

10.

The recommendation that Respondents be terminated from employment was

not related to their competency as teachers.

11(a). Respondent Christine Kai testified that some of the seniority tie breaking

criteria used by the Governing Board was unfair.

11(b). The Governing Board adopted Resolution 10-13 on March 7, 2011. That

resolution set forth the seniority tie breaking criteria to be applied when certificated
permanent and probationary employees share the same first date of paid service. Criterion
10 of Resolution 10-13 ranked employees in seniority order based on training and experience
in a program called “Response to Intervention.” Criterion 11 of Resolution 10-13 gave
greater seniority to employees with experience teaching a full inclusion classroom in the last
two school years than those without such experience. Full inclusion refers to the inclusion of
students with special education needs into regular education classrooms.

11(c). Respondent Kai argued that not all teachers within the BPSD had the
opportunity to receive “Response to Intervention” training and only one school within the
BPSD contains a full inclusion classroom. Therefore, argued Respondent Kai, not all
Respondents could be equitably assessed in the seniority tie breaking analyses when
considering criteria 10 and 11 of Resolution 10-13.

12.

BPSD argued that its tie breaking criteria were proper and served the function
to determine the order of termination when Respondents shared the first date of paid service.

13

The parties agreed to the following amendments to the seniority dates of three

Respondents. Respondent Eva Araujo’s seniority date is August 21, 2000, and not August
28, 2000. Respondent Mary Biner’s seniority date is August 21, 2000, and not August 28,
2000. Respondent Laura Lucero’s seniority date is August 19, 2002, and not August 26,
2002.

14.

No certificated employee junior to any Respondent was retained to render a

service that any Respondent is certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

The parties met all notice and jurisdictional requirements set forth in

Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.

It is appropriate to amend Respondent Eva Araujo’s seniority date to August

21, 2000, Respondent Mary Biner’s seniority date to August 21, 2000, and Respondent Laura
Lucero’s seniority date to August 19, 2002.

3.

Respondent Kai’s argument regarding the unfair use of seniority tie breaking
criteria 10 and 11 was unpersuasive. Respondent Kai’s testimony was insufficient evidence
to establish that not all teachers had the opportunity to receive the “Response to Intervention”
training. Further, the evidence did not establish that not all Respondents had the opportunity
to receive the “Response to Intervention” training. The evidence was also insufficient to
establish that only one school within the BPSD contains a full inclusion classroom. The

3

evidence did establish that the seniority tie breaking criteria was based on the needs of BPSD
and its students.

4.

The services identified in the Governing Board’s resolution number 10-14 are

particular kinds of services that the Governing Board can reduce or discontinue under
Education Code section 44955. The Governing Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the
identified services was not arbitrary or capricious, and was a proper exercise of its discretion.
Cause for the reduction or discontinuation of services relates solely to the welfare of BPSD’s
schools and pupils within the meaning of Education Code section 44949.

BPSD properly identified the certificated employees providing the particular

kinds of services that the Governing Board directed to be reduced or discontinued.

A school district may reduce services within the meaning of Education Code

section 44955, subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to
students shall not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by
determining that proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are
made available to deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 167, 178-179.)

BPSD established cause to not reemploy Respondents for the 2011-2012

school year.

No junior certificated employee is scheduled to be retained to perform services

that a more senior employee is certificated and competent to render.

9.

Cause exists to sustain BPSD’s action to reduce or discontinue the full-time
equivalent positions set forth in BPSD’s Resolution 10-14 for the 2011-2012 school year,
pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, as set forth in Factual Findings 1-14,
and Legal Conclusions 1-8.

The Accusations served on Respondents Eva Araujo, Mary Beckelheimer

Angela Beucler, Mary Biner, Felicia Clark, Katherine Del Re, Catherine Hackett, Deborah
Hegstrom, Christine Kai, Leona Kendall, Steven Little, Laura Lucero, Christina Luckey,
Andrew Osborn, Tanya Samarin, Kristin Sherman, Rowyna Shiohama, and Andrienne

School District directed to be reduced or discontinued, are sustained.
