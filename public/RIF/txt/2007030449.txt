FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

Jeffrey  Bobbitt,  Acting  President/Superintendent  of  the  Redwoods  Community 

College  District,  made  and  filed  the  accusations  in  his  official  capacity. 

2. 

On  March  6,  2007,  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Redwoods  Community 

College  District  adopted  Resolution  No.  603,  finding  that  it  was  in  the  best  interest  of  the 
district  that,  as  of  the  end  of  the  2006-2007  school  year,  “certain  particular  kinds  of  services 
now  being  provided  by  the  District”  be  reduced  or  discontinued  as  follows: 

1, 
2. 

Eliminate  the  equivalent  of  one  (1.0)  F.T.E.  Engineering  position.! 
Eliminate  the  equivalent  of  one  (1.0)  F.T.E.  Education  position. 

The  board  further  authorized  the  Acting  President/Superintendent  or  his  designee  to 
initiate  and  pursue  the  procedures  necessary  to  not  re-employ  the  equivalent  of  two  full-time 
academic  employees  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  87740  and  87743. 

'  “FTE.”  means  full-time  equivalent  (FTE).

3. 

The  district  anticipates  a  deficit  of  about  $4  million  for  the  2007-2008  school 

year.  It  has  implemented  or  is  considering  a  series  of  cost  reduction  measures,  including: 
holding  vacant  administrative  positions  open;  “freezing”  vacant  academic  positions;  holding 
vacant  support  staff  positions  open;  and,  reallocating  resources  away  from  low  enrollment 
courses  and  programs,  The  proposed  discontinuance  of  the  engineering  and  education 
positions  in  this  matter  is  part  of  these  cost  reduction  efforts. 

e 

4. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  related  to  the 

welfare  of  the  district  and  its  pupils. 

5. 

Respondents  Keith  Level  and  Deborah  Nolan  are  employed  by  the  district  as 
academic  employees.  Each  holds  a  1.0  FTE  position.  The  parties  stipulated  that  the  district 
properly  served  respondents  with  the  documents  necessary  to  establish  jurisdiction  in  this 
matter.  Level  and  Nolan  requested  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for  not 
reemploying  them  for  the  2007-2008  school  year. 

6. 

Although  the  board’s  March  6,  2007,  resolution  spoke  of  one  FTE  engineering 
position  and  one  FTE  education  position  as  “particular  kinds  of  service  now  being  provided,” 
the  district  did  not  provide  such  services  in  the  2006-2007  school  year.  Instead,  it  provided 
0.8  FTE  in  engineering  and  0.77  FTE  in  education. 

7. 

District  instructors’  teaching  loads  are  tracked  by  “teaching  load  units”  (TLU). 

45  TLU  are  considered  a  standard  load  for  a  full-time  equivalent  position. 

8. 

Although  there  is  no  engineering  department  or  engineering  program  as  such 

in  the  district,  it  offers  a  number  of  engineering  courses  that  are  prerequisites  for  degrees  and 
certificate  programs  or  provide  transfer  credits  for  students  seeking  to  transfer  to  the 
University  of  California  and  California  State  University  systems.  In  the  2006-2007  school 
year,  those  courses  amounted  to  36  TLU,  or  0.8  FTE  (36/45  =  0.8).  Respondent  Level  taught 
all  of  those  courses,  including  Engineering  23  —  Engineering  Graphics.  Level  also  taught 
non-engineering  courses  that  constituted  the  balance  of  his  1.0  FTE  position;  the  district  has 
not  proposed  the  discontinuance  or  reduction  of  these  non-engineering  services. 

9. 

A  few  weeks  after  the  board’s  March  6,  2007  resolution,  Acting 

President/Superintendent  Bobbitt  and  Vice  President  Sydney  Fisher  Larson  had  a 
conversation  with  Steven  Brown,  a  professor  of  drafting  technology  and  former  chair  of  the 
district’s  business  and  technology  division.  Brown  informed  Bobbitt  and  Larson  that  the 
Engineering  23  course  was  a  foundational  course  for  several  district  degree  and  certificate 
programs.  Brown  advised  Bobbitt  and  Larson  that  it  was  important  to  provide  the 
Engineering  23  course  in  the  2007-2008  school  year.  Bobbitt  and  Larson  concurred;  thus  the 
district  will  provide  two  Engineering  23  courses  in  the  2007-2008  school  year.  Based  on 
Brown’s  testimony  and  respondents’  exhibits,  it  appears  that  the  two  Engineering  23  courses 
to  be  provided  in  the  2007-2008  school  year  will  amount  to  24  TLU,  or  about  0.5  FTE. 
Brown, a  long  time  district  employee  with  more  seniority  than  respondent  Level,  is 
scheduled  to  teach  the  Engineering  23  courses.

10. 

|  Respondent  Deborah  Nolan  was  hired  in  2004  to  teach  in  the  district’s 

education  program.  Since  then,  and  including  the  2006-2007  school  year,  Nolan  has  been 
the  only  instructor  in  the  district’s  education  program.  Nolan  holds  a  1.0  FTE  position,  but 
not  all  of  her  teaching  was  in  education  courses.  In  the  2006-2007  school  year,  0.77  FTE  of 
her  assignment  was  in  education.  Nolan  also  taught  general  studies  courses  that  constituted 
the  balance  of  her  1.0  FTE  position;  the  district  has  not  proposed  the  discontinuance  or 
reduction  of  these  general  studies  services. 

11. 

Nolan  was  recently  granted  an  FSA  (Faculty  Service  Area)  for  music.  It  was 

not  established  that  Nolan  applied  to  the  district  to  add  this  FSA  qualification  before 
February  15,  2007. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

The  particular  kinds  of  services  provided  by  the  district  in  engineering  in  the 

2006-2007  school  year  did  not  amount  to  1.0  FTE.  The  actual  amount  of  those  services  was 
0.8  FTE,  and  0.8  FTE  was  the  maximum  amount  the  district  might  have  eliminated  for  the 
2007-2008  school  year.  The  evidence  established  further,  however,  that  the  district  will 
provide  two  Engineering  23  courses  in  the  2007-2008  school  year,  amounting  to  0.5  FTE. 
Thus,  the  district  will  be  reducing  engineering  services  by  0.3  FTE  (0.8  FTE  —  0.5  FTE). 

2. 

Cause  for  the  elimination  of  0.3  FTE  in  engineering  exists  in  accordance  with 

Education  Code  sections  87740  and  87743.  This  cause  relates  to  the  welfare  of  the  district 
and  its  students  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  87740.  Cause  thereby  exists 
to  give  respondent  Level  notice  that  0.3  FTE  of  his  service  will  not  be  required  for  the  2007- 
2008  school  year.” 

3. 

The  particular  kinds  of  services  provided  by  the  district  in  education  in  the 

2006-2007  school  year  did  not  amount  to  1.0  FTE.  The  actual  amount  of  those  services  was 
0.77  FTE,  and  0.77  FTE  is  the  maximum  amount  the  district  may  eliminate  for  the  2007- 
2008  school  year. 

4, 

Education  Code  section  87743.3  requires  that  a  faculty  member  apply  to  the 

district  to  add  an  FSA  before  February  15  in  order  for  that  FSA  to  be  considered  in  any 
proceeding  under  Education  Code  section  87743.  It  was  not  shown  that  respondent  Nolan 
met  this  requirement  with  regard  to  her  music  FSA. 

5. 

Cause  for  the  elimination  of  0.77  FTE  in  education  exists  in  accordance  with 
Education  Code  sections  87740  and  87743.  This  cause  relates  to  the  welfare  of  the  district 
and  its  students  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  87740.  Cause  thereby  exists 

?  By  respondents’  calculation,  respondent  Level  may  be  reduced  by  0.4  F.T.E.  The  record,  however, 

shows  the  actual  amount  is  0.3  F.T.E.

  

  

to  give  respondent  Nolan  notice  that  0.77  FTE  of  her  service  will  not  be  required  for  the 
2007-2008  school  year.
