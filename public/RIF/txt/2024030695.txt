Resolution No. 2023-24-88 (reduction resolution), reducing or discontinuing particular 
kinds of services for the 2024-2025 school year, establishing tie-breaking criteria, and 
directing the district’s superintendent to send appropriate notices to all employees 
whose positions may be affected by the reduction or discontinuation of services.

K-12 certificated employee. +1 per year.

4. The reduction resolution identified the services to be reduced for the 
2024-2025 school year as: 3Professional Development Specialists 12 full time equivalent (FTE)
School Counselors  6 FTE 
5. The services set forth in the reduction resolution are particular kinds of 
services that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code 
section 44955. 
6. On March 14, 2024, Interim Chief Human Resources Officer Jason Barney 
provided written notice to eight certificated employees that their services would not 
be required for the 2024-2025 school year pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 
and 44955, and that they had the right to request a hearing. 
7. All those receiving notices submitted timely requests for hearing. 
8. On March 22, 2024, Barney made and filed the District Statement of 
Reduction in Force in his official capacity as Interim Chief Human Resources Officer of 
the district. 
9. Respondents were served with a Reduction in Force Packet, which 
included: a Statement to Respondent, the district’s Statement of Reduction in Force, 
the reduction resolution, copies of relevant Education Code and Government Code 
sections, and a Notice of Participation form. 
10. On April 2, 2024, respondents were served with a Notice of Hearing 
notifying them of the date and time set for hearing. 
11. Respondents submitted Notices of Participation, and this hearing ensued. 412. Of the original eight respondents, six were able to resolve their layoff 
issue prior to the hearing, leaving Emily Jones and Jena Holman the sole respondents 
at hearing. 
13. Both respondents are probationary full-time counselors for the district.
14. Barney credibly testified about the reduction resolution and the steps 
taken by the district to implement it. Barney participated in the preparation of the 
district’s seniority list, noting each certificated employee’s first date of paid service, job 
class description, assignment, permanency status, credentials, and certifications, and 
ranking employees in order of seniority. 
15. Neither respondent objected to the seniority list. 
16. No permanent or probationary employee with less seniority is being 
retained to render a service for which respondents are certificated and competent. 
LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 
1. The district complied with all notice and jurisdictional requirements set 
forth in Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.
2. Pursuant to Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), when a 
governing board reduces particular kinds of services resulting in a decrease in the 
number of certificated, permanent employees, the services of a permanent employee 
may not be terminated if another employee with less seniority is retained to render a 
service that the more senior employee is “certificated and competent to render.”53. The seniority date of certificated employees is determined in accordance 
with Education Code section 44845, which provides: “Every probationary or permanent 
employee employed after June 30, 1947, shall be deemed to have been employed on 
the date upon which he first rendered paid service in a probationary position.”
4. Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the 
reduction of particular kinds of services by the district for the 2024-2025 school year
as set forth in the reduction resolution. The cause relates solely to the welfare of the 
district and its students, within the meaning of Education Code section 44949.
RECOMMENDATION
Notice may be given to both respondents that their services will not be required 
for the 2024-2025 school year.
