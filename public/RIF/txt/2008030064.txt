FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

On  March  19,  2008,  Dr.  Janice  Cook,  Superintendent,  Cajon  Valley  Union 
School  District  (District),  signed  and  filed  the  Accusation  in  her  official  capacity  and  not 
otherwise. 

2.

3. 

In  March  2008,  in  accordance  with  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955, 
the  Superintendent,  through  Kari  Hull,  Assistant  Superintendent,  Human  Resources,  notified 
the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  (the  Board)  in  writing  of  her  recommendation  to  reduce 
or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of  services  for  the  upcoming  school  year.  The  Superintendent 
stated  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation. 

4. 

On  March  4,  2008,  the  Board,  adopted  Resolution  03-06-765  JC,  determining 
that  it  would  be  necessary  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of  services  at  the  end  of 
the  current  school  year.  The  Board  determined  that  the  particular  kinds  of  services  that 
required  to  be  reduced  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  were  the  following  full  time  equivalent

The  proposed  reductions  totaled  137.4  full-time  equivalent  (FTE)  positions.

The  Board  directed  the  Superintendent  or  her  designee  to  send  appropriate

notices  to  all  employees  who  might  be  affected  by  the  reduction  and  elimination  of  particular 
kinds  of  services  noted  above. 

aspects  of  the  layoff.  The  District  developed  a  Seniority  List  that  contained,  among  other 
things,  the  employee’s  name,  seniority  date,  assignment,  credential,  authorization(s)  and 
classification  as  permanent  or  probationary. 

A  teacher  hired  as  a  probationary  employee  who  worked  as  a  substitute  or  temporary 
employee  for  at  least  75  percent  of  the  school  days  during  the  previous  year  and  had 
performed  the  duties  normally  required  of  a  certificated  employee  of  the  school  district,  was 
deemed  to  have  served  a  complete  school  year  as  a  probationary  employee  if  employed  as  a 
probationary  employee  for  the  following  school  year.  The  teacher  was  entitled  to  have  that 
earlier  year  counted  as  a  year  of  probationary  service. 

    

After  the  Board  adopted  the  resolution  to  reduce  services  by  137.4  FTE 
positions,  the  District  continued  to  evaluate  personnel  needs  in  the  District.  Since  the 
resolution  was  adopted,  and  after  taking  into  consideration  upcoming  positively  assured 
attrition,  resignations,  and  retirements,  the  District  has  now  determined  it  can  meet  its  fiscal 
needs  by  reducing  services  by  a  total  of  97  FTE  positions  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  To 

Education  Code  section  44845.

7. 

accomplish  this  reduction  of  services,  the  District  needed  to  give  preliminary  notices  of 
termination  to  97  certificated  employees,  67  of  whom  are  respondents  in  this  proceeding. 

8. 

On  or  before  March  15,  2008,  each  certificated  employee  who  is  party  to  this 

proceeding  was  given  notice  that  the  Superintendent  had  recommended  that  his  or  her 
services  with  the  District  would  be  terminated  at  the  conclusion  of  the  current  school  year 
and  that  his  or  her  services  would  not  be  needed  by  the  District  for  the  upcoming  2008-2009 
school  year.  Each  employee  was  notified  of  the  right  to  a  hearing. 

9. 

Each  respondent  timely  filed  a  written  request  for  hearing  to  determine  if  there 

was  cause  for  not  reemploying  that  respondent  for  the  upcoming  school  year.  Accusations 
were  thereafter  timely  served  on  each  respondent.  Each  respondent  timely  filed  a  Notice  of 
Defense.  All  pre-hearing  jurisdictional  requirements  were  met. 

10. 

The  services  the  Board  addressed  in  Resolution  No.  03-06-765  JC  were 

“particular  kinds  of  services”  that  could  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of 
Education  Code  section  44955.  The  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  these 
particular  kinds  of  services  was  not  arbitrary  or  capricious,  but  constituted  a  proper  exercise 
of  discretion. 

ll. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  related  to  the 

welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils.  The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of 
services  was  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  as 
determined  by  the  Board.  No  particular  kinds  of  services  were  lowered  to  levels  less  than 
those  levels  mandated  by  state  or  federal  law. 

12. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  to  any  respondent  was  retained  to  perform  any 

services  which  any  respondent  was  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

13. 

The  District  dismissed  the  Accusations  against  the  following  teachers:  Argelia 
Cespedes,  Charles  Phillip  Clegg,  Nicole  M.  Cramption,  Bethany  Joy  Dizon,  Laura  E,  Eisele, 
Jeffrey  P.  Gumbayan,  Heather  Paige  Hobson,  Deanna  Lynn  Jones,  Jennifer  Lynne  Koett, 
Lindsay  Owens,  Rebecca  Marie  Rettinger,  Nona  R.  Richard,  Jason  Lawrence  Robbins, 
Mackenzie  Leigh  Rollins,  Shauna  Rose  Stueve,  Nina  Marie  Tubbs,  Autumn  Dawn  Welch, 
and  Virginia  Concepcion  Wilhite. 

14. 

As  part  of  its  overall  reduction  or  elimination  of  particular  kinds  of  services 

the  District  released  all  of  its  temporary  certificated  employees  before  laying-off  any 
probationary  or  permanent  certificated  employees. 
The  District  employs  temporary 
certificated  employees  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44909  and  44920. 

15. 

Respondents  Linda  Hirshmiller  and  Dayna  Louise  White  sought  to  have  their 

temporary  status  changed  to  probationary  because  they  assumed  after  they  were  hired  as 
temporaries  that  they  would  eventually  become  probationary  employees. 
However,  both 
signed  contracts  acknowledging  their  temporary  employment  status  at  the  time  of  initial 

  

 

employment  and  neither  worked  at  least  75  percent  of  the  number  of  days  during  the  regular 
school  year.’ 

16. 

|  Respondent  Mary  Patricia  Durel  sought  to  have  her  status  as  temporary 

changed  to  a  probationary  status  because  she  had  served  two  consecutive  years  in  a 
categorically  funded  program. 
toward  permanent  employment  because  she  did  not  serve  at  least  75  percent  of  the  number  of 
days  during  the  regular  school  year  and  she  was  not  subsequently  employed  asa 
probationary  employee in  a  position  requiring  certification qualifications.* 

However,  she  was  not  entitled  to  have  her  service  count 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 

44955,  All  notices  and  jurisdictional  requirements  contained  in  those  sections  were  satisfied 
as  to  those  certificated  employees  identified  herein. 

2. 

Employment  of  a  temporary  teacher  for  two  consecutive  years  does  not 

compel  a  District  to  classify  the  temporary  teacher  as  a  probationary  teacher.  Moreover 
temporary  teachers  are  not  entitled  to  probationary  status  on  the  basis  of  their  total  length  of 
service.  (Santa  Barbara  Federation  of  Teachers  v.  Santa  Barbara  High  School  District 
(1977)  76  Cal.App.3d  223,  237.) 

3. 

Cause  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  District 

to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  cause  for  the  reduction  or 
discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  related  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and 
the  pupils  thereof.  A  preponderance  of  the  evidence  sustained  the  charges  set  forth  in  the 
accusation.  It  is  recommended  that  the  Board  give  respondents  notice  before  May  15,  2008, 
that  their  services  are  no  longer  required  by  the  District.

RECOMMENDATION 

It  is  recommended  that  the  Accusations  filed  against  Argelia  Cespedes,  Charles 

Phillip  Clegg,  Nicole  M.  Crampton,  Bethany  Joy  Dizon,  Laura  E.  Eisele,  Jeffrey  P. 
Gumbayan,  Heather  Paige  Hobson,  Deanna  Lynn  Jones,  Jennifer  Lynne  Koett,  Lindsay 
Owens,  Rebecca  Marie  Rettinger,  Nona  R.  Richard,  Jason  Lawrence  Robbins,  Mackenzie 
Leigh  Rollins,  Shauna  Rose  Stueve,  Nina  Marie  Tubbs,  Autumn  Dawn  Welch,  and  Virginia 
Concepcion  Wilhite  be  dismissed. 

It  is  recommended  that  the  accusations  served  on  all  other  respondents  be  sustained 

and  that  the  Board  send  final  notice  to  these  respondent  certificated  employees  who  were 
previously  served  with  the  preliminary  layoff  notice  that  their  services  will  not  be  required 
for  the  2008  —  2009  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  particular 

services.
