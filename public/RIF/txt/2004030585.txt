-  PROPOSED  DECISION 

Samuel  D.  Reyes,  Administrative  Law  Judge,  Office  of  Administrative  Hearings,  heard 

this  matter  in  Paso  Robles,  California. 

Peter  Carton,  Attorney  at  Law,  represented  Vera  Wallen,  Interim  Superintendent 

(“Superintendent”),  of  the  San  Miguel  Joint  Union  School  District  (“District”). 

Dawn  K.  McGee,  Attorney  at  Law,  represented  Respondents. 

Oral  and  documentary  evidence,  and  evidence  by  oral  stipulation  on  the  record,  was 

received  at  the  hearing  and  the  matter  was  submitted  for  decision. 

The  District  has  determined  to  lay  off  Respondents,  certificated  employees,  following  its 
decision  to  reduce  particular  kinds  of  services  pursuant  to  section  44955.  Respondents  seek  a 
determination  regarding  whether  cause  exists  to  terminate  their  services  for  the  2004-05  school 
year  and  specifically  argue  that  the  District  is  seeking  to  layoff  a  greater  number  of  certificated 
employees  than  authorized  by  its  governing  board. 

FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

Superintendent  Wallen  filed  the  Accusation  in  her  official  capacity. 

2. 

Respondents  are  certificated  employees  of  the  District.  The  all  hold  clear  multi- 
subject  teaching  credentials.  In  addition,  Respondent  Angel  holds  a  supplemental  authorization 
in  English  and  Respondent  Hammons  holds  a  supplemental  authorization  in  social  sciences. 

3. 

Respondents  are  all  permanent  employees  of  the  District.  

4, 

In  March  2003,  the  Superintendent  recommended  to  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
District  (“Board”)  the  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  for  the  2004- 
05  school  year. 

5. 

The  Board  adopted  Resolution  Number  04-3  on  March  10,  2003,  approving  the 

Superintendent’s  recommendation. 

6. 

On  March  11  and  12,  2004,  the  District  gave  each  Respondent  written  notice  of 
the  Superintendent’s  recommendation  that  Respondents’  services  will  not  be  required  for  the 
2004-05  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  or  elimination  of  particular  kinds  of  services. 

Respondents  filed  timely  requests  for  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for 

.  hot  reemploying  them  for  the  2004-05  school  year. 

7. 

8. 

9. 

The  District  filed  and  served  the  Accusation  on  each  Respondent. 

Respondents  filed  timely  Notices  of  Defense. 

10. 

_—  All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met. 

11. 

‘In  adopting  Resolution  Number  04-3,  the  Board  took  action  to  reduce  the 

following  services  for  the  2004-05  school  year: 

Service 

Full  Time  Equivalent  Positions 

  

Grade  7-8  Fundamentals  Class 
Departmentalized  Electives 
Leave  of  absence 
Self-contained  elementary  classroom 

Total 

65 
50

4.0 

5.65 

With  the  exception  of  “Leave  of  absence,”  the  services  set  forth  in  factual 
12. 
finding  number  11 
are  particular  kinds  of  services  which  may  be  reduced  or  discontinued 
within  the  meaning  of  section  44955.  The  “leave  of  absence”  refers  to  an  individual  who  is  on 
approved  leave,  not  to  any  particular  service  to  students.  The  individual  in  question  did  not 
perform  any  services  during  the  2003-04  for  the  .5  FTE  being  reduced  and  thus  no  services  are 
being  discontinued.  Accordingly,  only  the  services  of  5.15  FTE  certificated  employees  may  be 
reduced. 

13. 

The  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor 

capricious  but  is  rather  a  proper  exercise  of  the  District's  discretion.

14. 

The  reduction  of  services  is  related  to  the  welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils, 
and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees  by  5.15  FTE 
positions  as  determined  by  the  Board. 

15. 

District  issued  preliminary  layoff  notices  to  Respondents  and  to  Deanna  Ramos 
(“Ramos”),  Sean  True  (“True”),  and  James  Woods  (“Woods”),  certificated  employees  who  did 
not  request  a  hearing. 

16. 

|  Woods  is  the  District’s  only  probationary  employee  and  its  most  junior  —his 
seniority  date  is  August  19,  2000.  He  teaches  the  four  periods  of  Grade  7-8  Fundamentals  Class 
(.65  FTE). 

17. 

True,  who  has  a  seniority  date  of  August  24,  1998,  holds  a  single  subject 
credential  in  social  science.  He  taught  the  elective  courses  being  eliminated.  He  is  a  full-time 
employee  not  being  retained. 

18. 

Ramos  is  the  Title  I  Resource  Teacher  for  half  of  her  time  and  is  on  leave  for  the 
remaining  .5  FTE.  She  has  taught  First  Grade  and  a  Kindergarten-First  Grade  combination 
class. 

19. 

Respondents  teach  elementary  school  classes.  In  laying  off  Woods  (.65  FTE)  and 
True  (1  FTE),  the  District  only  needs  to  reduce  3.50  FTE  to  achieve  the  required  5.15  FTE 
reductions. 

20. 

Respondents  and  Ramos  are  credentialed  and  competent  to  teach  elementary 
school.  The  order  of  seniority  for  these  teachers  is  as  follows:  Respondent  Hattar  (August  22, 
2001);  Respondent  Reed  (August  22,  2001);  Ramos  (August  21,  2000);  Respondent  Hammons 
(August  21,  2000);  and  Respondent  Peterson  (August  24,  1998). 

21. 

The  District  can  achieve  the  necessary  3.5  FTE  reduction  with  the  layoff  of 
Respondents  Hammons,  Hattar,  and  Reed  (1  FTE  position  each)  and  Ramos  (.5  FTE).  It 
is 
therefore  unnecessary,  and  cause  does  not  exist,  to  layoff  an  additional  teacher.  Respondent 
Peterson  is  the  most  senior  elementary  school  teacher  and  therefore  shall  be  retained. 

22. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  to  Respondents  Hammons,  Hattar,  or  Reed  was 
retained  to  render  a  service  for  which  these  Respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to 
render. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1, 

Jurisdiction  for  the  subject  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  sections  44949  and 

44955,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  1  through  10. 

 

2, 

With  the  exception  of  “Leave  of  absence,”  the  services  listed  in  factual  finding 
number  11  are  each  determined  to  be  a  particular  kind  of  service  within  the  meaning  of  section 
44955,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  11  and  12. 

3. 

Cause  exists  to  reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  by 
5.15  FTE  positions  due  to  the  reduction  of  the  services  described  in  factual  finding  number  11, 
by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  11  through  13. 

4, 

Cause  for  the  reduction  of  the  services  set  forth  in  factual  finding  number  11, 
except  for  “Leave  of  absence,”  relates  to  the  welfare  of  the  District's  schools  and  pupils  within 
the  meaning  of  section  44949,  by  reason  of  actual  finding  numbers  11  through  14,  and  legal 
conclusion  numbers  |  through  3. 

5. 

Cause  does  not  exist  to  terminate  the  services  of  Respondent  Peterson,  by  reason 

of  factual  finding  numbers  11  through  21. 

Cause  exists  to  terminate  the  services  of  Respondents  Hammons,  Hattar,  and 

Reed,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  |  through  22. 

The  District  may  give  final  layoff  notices  to  Respondents  Hammons,  Hattar,  and 

6. 

7. 

Reed. 

ORDER 

l. 

The  Accusation  is  sustained  against  Respondents  Hammons,  Hattar,  and  Reed 
and  the  District  may  notify  them  that  their  services  will  not  be  needed  during  the  2004-05 
school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services. 

2. 

The  Accusation  is  not  sustained  against  Respondent  Peterson  and  the  District 

may  not  terminate  her  services  for  the  2004-05  school  year.
