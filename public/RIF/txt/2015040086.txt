FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1. 

Robert Nelson is the Superintendent of the Chawanakee Unified School 

District (District).  The actions of Superintendent Nelson, and those of the District’s staff and 
Governing Board (Board), were taken solely in their official capacities.  

Kayla West (respondent) is a certificated probationary employee of the 

On March 10, 2015, Superintendent Nelson recommended to the Board, 

pursuant to Education Code sections 44949, 44955, and other applicable provisions of law, 
that notice be given to respondent and other affected employees that their services will not be 
required for the ensuing 2015-2016 school year, and stating the reasons therefor.

On March 10, 2015, the Board adopted Resolution No. 20-2014/2015, 

reducing or eliminating particular kinds of services (PKS) of the District, and affecting 1.49 
Full Time Equivalent (FTE) certificated positions. 

The Resolution states that it will be necessary to reduce the following PKS of 
the District, and to decrease a corresponding number of certificated employees in the District 
no later than the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year:  
 

SERVICE 
One 9-12 Teaching Position, Special 
Education at Minarets High School 
One 9-12 Teaching Position, English at 
Minarets High School 
Total 

FTE 
  0.49 

1.0 

  1.49 

6. 

The services set forth in the PKS Resolution are “particular kinds of services” 
that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.  
There was no evidence that the Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the identified 
services was arbitrary or capricious.  The reduction or elimination of the services set forth in 
the PKS Resolution constituted a proper exercise of the Board’s discretion, within the 
meaning of section 44955.   

As a result of the above PKS reductions and/or eliminations, the Board 

determined that it was necessary to decrease 1.49 FTE positions for certificated employees in 
the District at the close of the 2014-2015 school year, in accordance with Education Code 
section 44955. 
 
8. 

On March 11, 2015, Superintendent Nelson gave respondent written notice, 
pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 of his recommendation to the Board 
that respondent’s services would be reduced for the ensuing school year, and the reasons 
therefor. 

Respondent timely filed a Request for Hearing to determine whether there was 

cause for not reemploying her full-time for the 2015-2016 school year. 

 
10.  On March 26, 2015, a Statement of Reduction in Force was filed on behalf of 

the District, and caused to be served on respondent.  Respondent timely filed a Notice of 
Participation requesting a hearing in this matter.

date is August 14, 2014.  She is a probationary full-time District employee assigned to teach 
English at Minarets High School.   
 
 
Single Subject English credential.  His District seniority date is also August 14, 2014.  Mr. 
Vaughan and respondent are listed on the District’s Seniority List, respectively, as numbers 
61 and 62 in order.         
 
 
reduction in English at Minarets High School resulted in respondent’s position being 
discontinued.  Mr. Nelson determined that respondent and Mr. Vaughan had the same date of 
first paid service with the District.  He applied tie-break criteria that had been adopted by the 
Board in 2006, and that had been incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement 
between the District and the teachers.  (Appendix C Criteria to Determine the Order of 
Termination Among Certificated Employees With the Same Date of Paid Service.)  The tie-
break criteria for determining the order of termination of certificated employees is to be 
applied sequentially.  It provides in part:   
 

Superintendent Nelson testified at hearing.  He explained that the 1.0 FTE 

       

14. 

A.  Credentials and experience to teach or serve in a particular 
program or provide a particular service of need by the District. 
Rating:  +1 per credential, +1 per year of experience 
 
B.  Credentials and experience to teach in a special education 
program (e.g., bilingual, special education) 
Rating:  +1 per credential, +1 per year of experience 
 
C.  Years of experience previous to current employment as a 
full-time, credentialed teacher in a probationary/permanent, K-
12 teaching situation in a public/private school. 
Rating:  +1 per year 

15. 

In applying the above tie-break criteria, Superintendent Nelson determined 
that respondent and Mr. Vaughan remained tied after applying criteria A and B.  He gave 
credit to Mr. Vaughan under criterion C as Mr. Vaughan had taught in a K-12 teaching 
situation over a four-month period (01/27/14 to 05/30/14) in the Salinas Union High School 
District.  Respondent had no comparable prior employment in a K-12 teaching situation.  
This resulted in Mr. Vaughan being ranked higher than respondent on the District’s seniority 
list.   

 
It was established that the District correctly applied the tie-break criteria with regard 

to respondent and Mr. Vaughan.

Respondent believes she should be given tie-break credit for her service in 

Respondent indicated that she had been provided earlier information from her 
principal, Daniel Ching, suggesting that her position was safe.  She was also advised that Mr. 
Vaughan’s seniority date was three days earlier than hers.  When she learned that they 
actually had the same District hire date, she proceeded to hearing in order to learn what tie-
break criteria had been applied by the District.  Up until the time of hearing, she had not been 
provided with the District’s tie-break criteria.     
 
 
other District programs.  For example, she provides instruction in English 9, Honors English, 
mentors students regarding peer conflicts, and Drama classes.  She also has experience 
(seven years) in theatre, and can coach soccer.       
 
 
correctly.  His evaluation of credentials and experience were in context of teaching English, 
and the other particular programs described by respondent were not a relevant consideration.  
He further indicated that the District is hopeful that it will retain respondent in an alternative 
education position.  This would require respondent to obtain a supplementary credential, and 
to be assigned to a K-12 blended learning program through the Chawanakee Academy.        
 
Welfare of the District and Its Students 
 

Superintendent Nelson testified credibly that the tie-break criteria were applied

19. 

The cause for not re-employing certificated employees relates solely to the 

welfare of the District’s schools, programs and the pupils thereof within the meaning of 
Education Code section 44949.  The Superintendent correctly identified the certificated 
employees providing the particular kinds of services that the Board directed be reduced or 
discontinued.  No junior certificated employee is scheduled to be retained to perform services 
which a more senior employee is certificated and competent to render. 
 
 
above are found to be without merit.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to Education Code sections 
44949 and 44955.  All notices and other jurisdictional requirements of sections 44949 and 
44955 were met. 
  

2. 

A District may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955, 

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not, 
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that 
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to 
deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 
178-179.)  The burden is on the District to demonstrate that the reduction or elimination of 
the particular kinds of services is reasonable and that the District carefully considered its 

4 

 

 

needs before laying off any certificated employee.  (Campbell Elementary Teachers 
Association v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 807-808.)   

 
3. 

 
5. 

 
6. 

The services identified in PKS Resolution No. 20-2014/2015 are particular 

kinds of services that may be reduced or discontinued pursuant to sections 44949 and 44955.  
The description of services to be reduced, both in the Board’s Resolution and in the notice, 
adequately described particular kinds of services.  (Zalac v. Ferndale USD (2002) 98 
Cal.App.4th 838; see, also, Degener v. Governing Board (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 689.) 
 

4. 

Legal cause exists to reduce or eliminate 1.49 FTE of particular kinds of 

services offered by the District as set forth in detail in the Factual Findings.  The Board’s 
decision to reduce or discontinue the identified services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, 
and was a proper exercise of its discretion.  Cause for the reduction or discontinuance of 
services relates solely to the welfare of the District’s schools and pupils within the meaning 
of Education Code section 44949. 

Education Code section 44955 provides:  “As between employees who first 

rendered paid service to the district on the same date, the governing board shall determine the 
order of termination solely on the basis of needs of the district and the students thereof.”  The 
District’s tie-break criteria were properly adopted by the Board in 2006.  The District applied 
the criteria correctly in this case by reason of the matters set forth in Findings 12 through 18.   

Cause exists for the reduction of the particular kinds of services and for the 
reduction of full-time equivalent certificated positions at the end of the 2014-2015 school 
year pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.  No employee with less seniority 
than respondent is being retained to render a service which respondent is certificated and 
competent to render.   

 
The District’s Board of Trustees may give final notice to respondent, that her services 

will be reduced by 1.0 FTE for the ensuing school year, 2015-2016.

2014-2015 school year.  Notice shall be given to respondent that her services will be reduced
