BEFORE  THE 
GOVERNING  BOARD  OF 
THE  AMADOR  COUNTY  UNIFIED  SCHOOL  DISTRICT 
STATE  OF  CALIFORNIA 

In  the  Matter  of  the  Reduction  in  Force  of: 

CERTAIN  CERTIFICATED  PERSONNEL 
EMPLOYED  BY  THE  AMADOR  COUNTY 
UNIFIED  SCHOOL  DISTRICT, 

  

Respondents. 

OAH  No.  2010030964 

PROPOSED  DECISION 

This  matter  was  heard  before  Karen  J.  Brandt,  Administrative  Law  Judge,  Office  of 

Administrative  Hearings  (“OAH”),  State  of  California,  in  Jackson,  California,  on  May  11,  2010. 

Ben  Hance,  Attorney  at  Law,  represented  the  Amador  County  Unified  School  District 

(“District”). 

Thomas  J.  Driscoll,  Jr.,  Attorney  at  Law,  represented  the  respondents  listed  on 

Attachment  A  hereto  (the  “Represented  Respondents”).  The  respondents  listed  on  Attachment  B 
hereto  (the  “Self-Represented  Respondents”)  represented  themselves  and  were  not  represented 
by  Mr.  Driscoll. 

On  May  11,  2010,  the  District  and  the  Represented  Respondents  agreed  to  certain  joint 

stipulations,  as  set  forth  on  Attachment  C  hereto  (the  “Joint  Stipulations”). 

Represented  Respondents 

FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1, 

At  the  commencement  of  the  hearing,  the  District  and  Represented  Respondents 

notified  Judge  Brandt  that  they  had  agreed  to  the  Joint  Stipulations,  and  that  the  Joint 
Stipulations  would  result  in  a  settlement  of  the  matters  set  forth  in  the  District’s  Accusation 
dated  April  5,  2010  (the  ““Accusation”),  a  copy  of  which  is  attached  as  Attachment  D  hereto,  with 
respect  to  the  Represented  Respondents.

Self-Represented  Respondents 

2. 

Nina  Neville,  Director  of  Personnel  of  the  District,  credibly  testified  that  the 

District  had  properly  and  timely  served  all  of  the  Self-Represented  Respondents,  among  others, 
with  all  notices  required  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  Included  among 

these  notices  was  a  Notice  of  Layoff  Hearing,  dated  March  30,  2010,  which  stated  that  the 
hearing  would  be  held  on  May  11  and  12,  2010,  at  9:30  a.m.  None  of  the  Self-Represented 
Respondents  appeared  at  the  hearing.  Because  the  Self-Represented  Respondents  did  not  appear 
at  the  hearing  on  May  11,  2010,  this  matter  proceeded  as  a  default  against  them  under 
Government  Code  section  11520. 

3. 

Ms.  Neville  further  testified  that  the  District  had  properly  and  timely  served 

respondent  Kelli  Thompson,  among  others,  with  a  Statement  to  Respondents,  dated  March  30, 
2010,  pursuant  to  Government  Code  section  11505,  which  stated  that  unless  a  written  request  to 
contest  the  charges  was  delivered  to  the  District’s  governing  board  (the  “Board”)  within  five  (5) 
days  of  the  date  of  the  Accusation  and  such  Statement  to  Respondents  were  personally  served  or 
mailed  to  said  Respondent,  the  Board  may  proceed  upon  the  Accusation  without  a  hearing.  The 
Board  did  not  received  a  Notice  of  Defense  from  Ms.  Thompson  until  April  16,  2010.  Because 
Ms.  Thompson  did  not  serve  a  timely  Notice  of  Defense  upon  the  District’s  governing  board, 
Ms.  Thompson  has  waived  her  right  to  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for  not 
reemploying  her  for  the  ensuing  year  pursuant  to  Government  Code  section  11506(c). 

Extension  of  Statutory  Deadlines 

4. 

The  hearing  of  this  matter  was  continued  from  its  originally  scheduled  date  of 
April  1,  2010  to  May  11,  2010  by  OAH  Order  dated  March  25,  2010  pursuant  to  Government 
Code  section  11524.  Pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44949(e),  the  dates  prescribed  in 
subdivision  (c)  of  such  section  which  occur  on  or  after  the  date  of  granting  the  continuance  and 
the  date  prescribed  in  subdivision  (c)  of  Education  Code  section  44955  which  occurs  after  the 
date  of  granting  the  continuance  shall  be  extended  for  a  period  of  time  equal  to  the  continuance. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

l. 

The  District  has  complied  with  all  notice  and  jurisdictional  requirements  set  forth 

in  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955. 

2. 

The  services  identified  in  Resolution  No.  09/2010-08,  dated  February  24,  2010,  of 

the  Board  are  particular  kinds  of  services  that  may  be  reduced  or  eliminated  under  Education 
Code  section  44955.  The  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  identified  services  was 
neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  and  was  a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion.

3. 

Cause  exists  to  reduce  certificated  employees  of  the  District  due  to  the  reduction 

or  elimination  of  particular  kinds  of  services  and/or  due  to  a  decline  in  the  average  daily 
attendance  in  all  schools  of  the  District  for  the  first  six  months  in  which  school  was  in  session  for 
the  current  school  year  of  2009-2010  below  that  of  the  corresponding  period  of  the  first  six 
months  of  one  or  both  of  the  comparison  school  years. 

4. 

The  reduction  or  elimination  of  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the 

District’s  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949. 

5. 

Subject  to  giving  effect  to  the  agreements  set  forth  in  the  Joint  Stipulations,  no 

junior  employee  is  scheduled  to  be  retained  to  perform  services  that  a  more  senior  respondent  is 
certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

6. 

Cause  exists  to  give  notice  to  the  Represented  Respondents  consistent  with  the 

agreements  set  forth  in  the  Joint  Stipulations  and  to  the  Unrepresented  Respondents. 

7. 

This  matter  shall  proceed  as  a  default  against  the  Self-Represented  Respondents 

under  Government  Code  section  11520. 

8. 

Ms.  Thompson  has  waived  her  right  to  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for 
not  reemploying  her  for  the  ensuing  year  pursuant  to  Government  Code  section  11506(c)  due  to 
her  failure  to  serve  a  timely  notice  of  defense  upon  the  Board. 

RECOMMENDATION 

1. 

The  Board  shall  adopt  the  Joint  Stipulations  reached  by  the  District  and  the 
Represented  Respondents.  The  Board  may,  if  it  so  chooses,  adopt  the  Joint  Stipulations  by 
implication  via  its  adoption  of  this  Proposed  Decision  in  the  form  submitted  to  the  Board. 

2. 

Notice  may  be  given  to  the  Represented  Respondents  that  their  services  will  be 

reduced  or  will  not  be  required  for  the  2010-2011  school  year,  consistent  with  the  Joint 
Stipulations.  Notice  may  be  given  to  the  Self-Represented  Respondents  that  their  services  will 
be  reduced  or  will  not  be  required  for  the  2010-2011  school  year.  Notice  will  be  given  in  inverse 
order  of  seniority. 

3. 

Copies  of  this  Proposed  Decision  shall  be  submitted  to  the  Board  and  to  the 

employee(s)  on  or  before  June  2,  2010  pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44949(c).  Notice  of 
termination  of  services  shall  be  given  before  June  11,  2010  pursuant  to  Education  Code  section 
44955(c).
