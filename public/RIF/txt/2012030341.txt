OAH No. 2012030341

PROPOSED DECISION

Mary Agnes Matyszewski, Administrative Law Judge, Office of Administrative
Hearings, State of California, heard this matter on April 27, 2012, in Chula Vista, California.

Mark Breese, Atkinson, Andelson, Loya, Ruud & Romo, represented Sweetwater

Union High School District (District).

Fern Steiner, Tosdal, Smith, Steiner & Wax, represented the respondents identified in

Exhibit 14.

Respondents Khristopher Audillo, Johnathan Chase, Julie Forrey, Keith Hammond,

Rachel Lin, Amy Mundo, Angela Torres, Angelica Valverde-Paredes, and Marie Carmen
Whitehead appeared and represented themselves.

There were no appearances by respondents Rodrigo Arancibia, Emma Geddes,
Lizveth Huerta, Luis Lopez, Christopher Matter, Graciela Nunez, Rosa Prins-Padro, Arlton
Ruiz, and Erik Swenson.

Before and during the hearing the accusations served on Derrick Almero, Richard

Barr, Jennifer Bottomley, Roufieh Carmody, Jeanette Fiorica, Rosa Gilliam, Sanna Goins,
Kelly Hamilton, Mercedes Hernandez, William House, Sara Huerta, Kristina Lopez,
Elizabeth Murphy, Jennifer Zark-Peffley, Alejandro Picazo, Shawn Pomatto, Erin Southam,

Oral and documentary evidence was received and the matter was submitted on April

27, 2012. Following the hearing and consistent with the presentation of the evidence, the
representations by the parties and the directive from the court, the District submitted an
amended layoff analysis, its final proposed layoff notice list, and its final proposed dismissal
list. Those documents were marked and received, respectively, as Exhibits 21, 22, and 23.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

Jurisdiction

1.

2.

Edward Brand, Superintendent, made and filed the accusation in his official

capacity as the District’s Superintendent.

Respondents are identified on Appendices A and B, attached hereto and by

this reference incorporated herein. All respondents are certificated employees of the District.

3.

On March 12, 2012, the Governing Board adopted a resolution which reduced
particular kinds of certificated services and directed the superintendent to give appropriate
notices to certificated employees whose positions would be affected by the action. The
resolution identified 2031 FTEs to be reduced.

Bump Analysis

4.

The Board implemented a bump analysis to determine which employees could

bump into a position being held by a junior employee. The resolution permitted a more
senior certificated employee to displace (“bump”) a less senior employee if the more senior
employee was competent and credentialed to “render the series performed by the less senior”
employee. Qualifications must include “highly qualified” NCLB status in the subject or
field, and “appropriate certification qualifications (including appropriate English language
authorizations)” and the senior employee must be able to displace the junior employee’s
“entire assignment.”

Layoff Determinations

5.

Consistent with the Board’s Resolution, the District identified certificated
employees for layoff. The decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is
matter reserved to the district’s discretion and is not subject to second-guessing in this
proceeding. (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 167.) A school district’s decision to reduce a particular kind of service must not
be fraudulent, arbitrary or capricious. (San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.
App. 3d 627, 637.)

6.

School districts have broad discretion in defining positions within the district

and establishing requirements for employment. This discretion encompasses determining the
training and experience necessary for particular positions. Similarly, school districts have
the discretion to determine particular kinds of services that will be eliminated, even though a
service continues to be performed or provided in a different manner by the district.
(Hildebrandt v. St. Helena Unified School Dist. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 334, 343.)

1

The accusation incorrectly alleged that the resolution identified 211 FTEs.

2

7.

On or before March 15, 2012, the District timely served on Respondents a

written notice that the Superintendent had recommended that their services would be
terminated at the close of the current school year. The reasons for the recommendation were
set forth in these preliminary layoff notices.

8.

An accusation was served on each respondent. No evidence was introduced

demonstrating that all prehearing jurisdictional requirements were not met.

Testimony from Individual Respondents

9.

Miguel Marin testified about the medical program, Hippocrates Circle, that he

created which prepares students for a medical career in a mentoring program with Kaiser
Permanente. This school-to-career program recently received a California Department of
Education grant allowing its expansion to the middle school. Mr. Marin testified about the
opportunities this program has afforded students. Mr. Marin’s testimony was a perfect
illustration of the type of dedicated, innovative teachers that a district loses when these
layoffs occur. Unfortunately, nothing about the District’s decision was arbitrary or
capricious and the decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is matter
reserved to the district’s discretion and is not subject to second-guessing in this proceeding.
(Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d
167.)

10.

Andrea Arroyo testified about the importance of art classes, especially for

special need students. While it may be true that her art class offers a unique benefit to
students, a school board may “reduce services” by eliminating certain types of services or by
reducing the number of district employees providing such services. The decision to reduce or
discontinue a particular kind of service is matter reserved to the district’s discretion and is not
subject to second-guessing in this proceeding. (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower
Unified School District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167.)

11.

Louie Marrone testified about his work with the students at Alta Vista

Academy, a facility that houses Level 12 and 14 students. He expressed his concern of
another individual being able to handle these difficult students. Although his testimony was
extremely reasonable and his concerns valid, nothing about the District’s decision was
arbitrary or capricious and the decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is
matter reserved to the district’s discretion and is not subject to second-guessing in this
proceeding (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 167) and school districts have the discretion to determine particular kinds of
services that will be eliminated, even though a service continues to be performed or provided
in a different manner by the district. (Hildebrandt v. St. Helena Unified School Dist. (2009)
172 Cal.App.4th 334, 343.)

12.

Katie Kennedy a bioscience teacher at Olympia High School provided a

notebook of her programs, the excellent feedback she has received and her teacher of the
year nomination. While the evidence established she is an asset to the District, unless the

3

District’s decision is arbitrary or capricious, it is not subject to second-guessing in this
proceeding. (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 167.)

13.

Luis Lopez a geography and AVID teacher at Sweetwater High School

testified about his passion for teaching and the “family” he and his colleagues have created.
While his testimony demonstrated his dedication to his profession, unfortunately unless the
District’s decision is arbitrary or capricious, it is not subject to second-guessing in this
proceeding. (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 167.)

14.

Johnathan Chase, an AP chemistry teacher, testified about his love of teaching,

of the ability for junior teachers to connect with students and the hours he puts in for the
District in order to help his students achieve. He expressed concern that teachers not subject
to layoff did not display that type of passion. While his testimony raised legitimate concerns,
absent skipping criteria which a district must validate, the Education Code provides for a
quantitative, not qualitative, layoff process. Thus, the District cannot retain a teacher based
solely upon his work ethic and dedication. Unless a decision is arbitrary or capricious, it is
not subject to second-guessing in this proceeding. (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of
Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167.)

15.

Richard Barr, who received a precautionary layoff notice, questioned why

some teachers with the same seniority date and credentials were released by the District at
the start of this hearing but his accusation was not rescinded. As indicated below, it is
recommended that the District rescind all precautionary layoff notices, including that issued
to Mr. Barr. However, given the issues he raised regarding his seniority date and his
credentials in relation to that of Mr. Ausero and Ms. Carmody, it is recommended that the
District review his concerns and make any necessary corrections to his seniority date.

16.

Ausberto Cisneros, a science teacher at Palomar High School, a continuation
school, testified about the positive impact he and his colleagues have had on students who
have been “rejected” elsewhere and the high percentage of those students who are now
college bound. Unfortunately, the Education Code layoff process is based upon seniority and
the District did not skip teachers at Palomar, thereby resulting in Mr. Cisneros’ layoff.
Unless a decision is arbitrary or capricious, it is not subject to second-guessing in this
proceeding. (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 167.)

17.

Juan Garcia testified that he is the only bilingual physics teacher at Eastlake

High School and laying him off will harm the students. However, it was not established that
the District would not re-assign teachers to different schools to fulfill ratio and staffing
requirements or make other bilingual teachers available. Unless a decision is arbitrary or
capricious, it is not subject to second-guessing in this proceeding (Rutherford v. Board of
Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167) and school
districts have the discretion to determine particular kinds of services that will be eliminated,

4

even though a service continues to be performed or provided in a different manner by the
district. (Hildebrandt v. St. Helena Unified School Dist. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 334, 343.)

Final Layoff List

18.

Sondra Huezo, Assistant Superintendent Human Resources, testified about the

District’s financial crisis. Although she admitted the District will still have reserves for
operating expenses next year, nothing requires a district to use them to preserve positions as
Boards are required to be fiscally responsible. Initially Ms. Huezo’s testimony made it
appear that the tie-breaking criteria had scored employees’ credentials incorrectly and she
admitted the list would have to be re-calculated. However, during a break in the proceeding
the District, its attorney and Ms. Steiner, reviewed the documents and upon further
reflection, it was established that the tiebreaking criteria had been properly calculated.

When questioned about current job postings for the District which included positions
being eliminated in this RIF, Ms. Huezo testified that the list was merely an “eligibility list”
and that no new applicants would be hired until respondents were re-hired. She also
explained that special education services were not being reduced, an employee merely
“bumped into” the position currently being held by one of the respondents.

19.

The District is not retaining any employee with less seniority to perform a

service that any respondent is certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to sections 44949 and 44955,

and all notices and other requirements of those sections have been provided as required.

A district may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not,
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.)

3.

The decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is matter

reserved to the district’s discretion and is not subject to second-guessing in this proceeding.
(Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d
167.)

4.

Because of the reduction of particular kinds of services, cause exists pursuant
to Education Code section 44955 to give notice to respondents that their services will not be
required for the 2012-2013 school year. The cause relates solely to the financial welfare of
the schools and the pupils thereof within the meaning of Education Code section 44949. The

5

District has identified the certificated employees who are providing the particular kinds of
services that the Board directed be reduced or discontinued. It is recommended that the
Board give respondents notice before May 15, 2012, that their services will not be required
by the District for the school year 2012-13.

RECOMMENDATIONS

It is recommended that the Board give notice to the respondents whose names are set

forth below on Appendix A that their employment will be terminated at the close of the
current school year and that their services will not be needed for the 2012-2013 school year.

It is recommended that the District withdraw the accusations filed against the

respondents listed on Appendix B and rescind their layoff notices.

Consistent with Factual Finding No. 15, the District shall review Richard Barr’s

concerns and make any necessary corrections to his seniority date.
