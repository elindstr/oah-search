On and before March 9, 2010, and March 10, 2010,2 Superintendent Jesus 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gandara gave written notice to approximately 110 certificated employees, including 
respondents, of the recommendation that their services would not be required for the 2010-11 
school year.  The reasons for the recommendation were set forth in these preliminary layoff 
notices. 
 
 
this matter, 75 of whom timely filed a Request for Hearing and Notice of Defense to 
determine if there was cause for terminating their services for the 2010-11 school year, two 
of whom did not,3 but the district waived its objections to their untimely submission of those 
pleadings.  An accusation was served on each respondent.  All prehearing jurisdictional 
requirements were met. 
 

A Stipulation introduced at hearing indicated that there were 77 respondents in

Before issuing the preliminary layoff notices, the district took into account all 

positively assured attrition.  The district must issue final layoff notices before May 15, and 
when it does so the district will take into account any additional attrition that has occurred.  
After that, further attrition will allow the district to rehire laid off employees.

The layoffs will not reduce any of the district’s offerings in code mandated 

courses below the level required by law.  

 
The district established skipping criteria pursuant to Education Code section 
44955(d)(1).  The district was required to implement the governing board’s resolution in a 
manner that was consistent with the board’s policies and the district’s efforts to offer certain 
services to its students.  There is no legal requirement mandating that skipping criteria be 
contained in a governing board’s resolution.  Employees who met any of the skipping criteria 
for some, but not all of their assignment(s) shall be retained only as to that portion of their 
assignment that meets the skipping criteria.

The district alleged that that it had relied on its seniority list when making 
layoff decisions which was the reason it sent verification requests to employees prior to 
March 15 to verify the accuracy of the information on that list.  The district alleged it had 
requested QTEL training information from its employees in that letter.5  However during 
hearing the district conceded that the letter did not specifically request QTEL training and 
that employees who possessed QTEL training were entitled to be skipped.  As a result of that 
concession, the district added respondent Marissa Audelo to the district’s skip list because of 
her QTEL training.  
 
READ 180 and QTEL Skipping Criteria 
 
 
skipping criteria.  Maria Castilleja, the Executive Director of Curriculum and Instruction, 
testified about the READ 180 program, an intervention reading program.  Castilleja 
explained that because many students in the district scored “Below Basic” and “Far Below

regarding QTEL training and respondents should not be faulted for not verifying that information.  If this criterion 
was to be used, it was incumbent upon the district to determine if any of the teachers subject to layoff had QTEL 
training.  

The primary issue in this hearing was the use of READ 180 and QTEL as

Basic” on standardized tests, the district had selected READ 180 from the state’s list of 
approved intervention reading programs as a way to improve student test scores.  Castilleja 
testified about the intensive training program that teachers had undergone during the past two 
school years to train them in the READ 180 program.  She explained that if READ 180 
teachers were not skipped, this would have a significant negative impact on the students and 
the district.  Castilleja testified that the “best of the best” teachers were on the READ 180 
skip list.  She testified that no teacher who wanted to receive READ 180 training had been 
turned down; in fact, several teachers had undergone that training for the first time during 
this past school year.  
 
 
19.  Oscar Medina, the Director of Language Acquisitions, testified about the 
QTEL Program, a professional development program provided by a nonprofit company 
which included a five day intensive training program regarding theory, practice, and 
implementation of strategies for teachers who teach English learners.6  Medina testified that 
the district skipped QTEL trained teachers because of the intensive training they had 
undergone and that not skipping these teachers would be detrimental to the district, which is 
currently on an improvement plan with the state to raise student test scores.  Medina testified 
that QTEL is presently conducting a three-year study7 to determine the effectiveness of its 
program.  Five of the 11 middle schools in the district were selected as “control schools” for 
that study and teachers at the control schools were not allowed to participate in QTEL 
training.  Medina conceded that the test scores in one of the control, non-QTEL, schools had 
improved and that it had performed as well as the QTEL schools.  
 
 
Education Code section 44955, subdivisions (b) and (c), set forth a general rule 
requiring school districts to retain senior employees over more junior employees and to retain 
permanent employees over temporary employees.  Any exception to this general rule must be 
based on statute.  For employees hired on the same date, Education Code section 44955, 
subdivision (d) provides: 
 

20. 

“(d)  Notwithstanding subdivision (b), a school district may deviate from terminating a 
certificated employee in order of seniority for either of the following reasons: 
 

(1) 

The district demonstrates a specific need for personnel to teach a specific 
course or course of study, or to provide services authorized by a services credential with 
a specialization in either pupil personnel services or health for a school nurse, and that 
the certificated employee has special training and experience necessary to teach that 
course or course of study or to provide those services, which others with more seniority 
do not possess. 
 

Medina’s reference to the QTEL personnel as his “friends” during his testimony raised great concerns 

                     
6  
regarding his bias and interest in the QTEL program and strongly suggested that Medina’s recommendations 
regarding QTEL, especially those contained in the Title III Improvement Plan he drafted, were based on his bias. 
 
7  

QTEL was one year into its three year study when Medina was hired by the district.

(2) 

For purposes of maintaining or achieving compliance with constitutional 

requirements related to equal protection of the laws.” 

 

21.  Under subdivision (d)(1), the District may skip a junior teacher being retained for 
specified reasons.  (Bledsoe v. Biggs Unified School District (2008) 170 Cal. App. 4th 127, 131.) 
 Junior teachers may be given retention priority over senior teachers only if the junior 
teachers possess superior skills or capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack.  
(Santa Clara Federation of Teachers, Local 2393, v. Governing Board of Santa Clara 
Unified School District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831, 842-843.)  

 
A school district’s decision to reduce a particular kind of service must not be 
fraudulent, arbitrary or capricious.  (San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal. 
App. 3d 627, 637.)  A district’s decision to retain junior bilingual teachers absent a showing that 
they were employed to teach classes in a formal bilingual program was improper.  (Alexander v. 
Delano Joint Union High School District (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 567.) 

 
22. 

 
23. 

The district’s skip list demonstrated that 15 teachers had been skipped.  One 
because of special education, five because of READ 180, six because of QTEL, and three 
because of READ 180 and QTEL.  Of those skipped teachers, only one had a current 
assignment to teach READ 180 full time.  One teacher currently taught two READ 180 classes, 
another taught one READ 180 class, and two teachers did not currently have READ 180 
assignments but had READ 180 assignments planned for the 2010- 2011 school year.  The 
skipped QTEL teachers taught various courses including English language development, 
structured English immersion, and health.   

The evidence established that the master schedules for the schools for the 2010-

2011 school year have not yet been set, in fact that process was to begin in the weeks following 
this hearing.  The district was unable to offer any evidence as to the number of READ 180 
classes that would be offered in the 2010-2011 school year.  The three-year QTEL study 
regarding the effectiveness of that program is still ongoing.  

 
24.  While the evidence did establish that READ 180 and QTEL appeared to be 

valuable programs, the evidence failed to establish that the teachers without the READ 180 or 
the QTEL training were not certificated and competent to meet the needs of the students, 
especially in light of the fact that one of the control schools had improved its students’ test 
scores.  Many skipped teachers were not currently teaching READ 180 courses.  Many teachers 
who received layoff notices were unaware of QTEL.  Most importantly, several teachers 
testified that they were not allowed to participate in the QTEL training because they were 
assigned to a control school.  Medina admitted that teachers at the control schools were not 
allowed to receive QTEL training.  Others testified that they were denied participation in QTEL 
or READ 180 training by their site principals.  In its closing, the district conceded that not all 
teachers had been given an opportunity to undergo READ 180 or QTEL training as it had been 
rolled out in stages and it was practically impossible to offer it to all employees at the same 
time.  While this may be true from a practical standpoint, and establishing control schools 
seemed a reasonable way to assess the QTEL training, specifically precluding groups of 

 

6

teachers from participating in those trainings and then using those trainings as a basis to skip 
junior teachers, made the use of READ 180 and QTEL training as skipping criteria arbitrary and 
capricious. 

 
25.  Any respondent certificated and competent, who received a layoff notice and 
 
is senior to a certificated employee who was skipped because the junior teacher was READ 
180 or QTEL trained was improperly noticed, the notice should be rescinded and that 
respondent retained.   

26. 

 
Other Issues 
 
Beverly Noriss testified about the dance program she provides which qualifies 
 
students for both a fine arts and PE credit.  Noriss testified that her class is only offered at the 
Chula Vista Middle School for the Creative and Performing Arts and is the only dance 
program offered in the South Bay.  Noriss has full enrollment every year.  She testified about 
the extensive training she has received from the district and the numerous committees she 
has served on and chaired.  While it may be true that her dance class is the only one offered 
in the district, a school board may “reduce services” by eliminating certain types of services or 
by reducing the number of district employees providing such services.  The decision to reduce 
or discontinue a particular kind of service is matter reserved to the district’s discretion and is 
not subject to second-guessing in this proceeding.  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of 
Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167.) 
 
 
27.  Daniel Pearson testified about his Industrial and Technical Education credential 
and his ROP certification.  He was asked by the district in 2007 to convert his classes to ROP 
classes, which he did.  Pearson testified about a mistake made in the recent past regarding his 
ROP certification.  Pearson testified that he is senior to other Industrial Arts teachers who did 
not receive layoff notices.  Given Pearson’s testimony, it is recommended the district review his 
personnel file as against those of other Industrial Arts teachers to determine if Pearson was 
properly noticed or if his layoff notice should be rescinded.  
 
 
testified about the importance of the drama program to students and a recent trip to visit 
Sacramento legislators with her students.  While drama may be an important class, a school 
board may “reduce services” by eliminating certain types of services or by reducing the number 
of district employees providing such services.  The decision to reduce or discontinue a 
particular kind of service is matter reserved to the district’s discretion and is not subject to 
second-guessing in this proceeding.  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified 
School District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167.)  However, as Trongale was also denied the 
opportunity to participate in QTEL, she may be certificated, competent and senior to a 
certificated employee who was skipped because of READ 180 or QTEL as discussed in 
Factual Finding No. 25 above.

30. 

Sarah Shepard, who holds a Spanish credential, testified about the AVID 

could be employed by the district.  Although the district admitted that it was unaware of the 
exact number of students who would need deaf services in 2010-2011, it did allege that the 
need for those services would decrease in the next school year based upon current 
projections.  No evidence was introduced that the district would be unable to meet the needs 
of its deaf or hard of hearing students and not all deaf and hard of hearing teachers were 
being released.  Even if that were the case, the district would be entitled to take that action as 
a school district may eliminate all district employees who provide services for special needs 
students and contract for those services with outside agencies.  (Campbell Elementary 
Teachers Assn. v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 812.)  No evidence established that the 
decision to reduce the deaf and hard of hearing service was unfair or improper simply because 
the school board made a decision it was empowered to make and the district’s decision to 
reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is matter reserved to the district’s discretion 
and is not subject to second-guessing in this proceeding.  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of 
Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167.) 
 
 
program and explained the intensive training required to be AVID trained.  She described the 
significant amounts of data that AVID teachers must maintain and testified the program has far 
more data to support its worth than QTEL.  She questioned why AVID had not been considered 
a “skip worthy” criteria.  The evidence did not establish that the district’s failure to use AVID as 
a skipping criteria was arbitrary or capricious (San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 
144 Cal. App. 3d 627, 637), and the district’s decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind 
of service is matter reserved to the district’s discretion and is not subject to second-guessing 
in this proceeding.  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District 
(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167.) 
 
 
James Sosa, a teacher with a Spanish and sociology credential, testified about the 
many positive aspects students obtain from learning languages.  Laurent Geilbert, a teacher with 
a French credential testified about the inconsistency in Resolution 3597 because so many cuts 
involved language teachers.  Lilia Meza testified about all the behind the scenes work that 
Spanish teachers provide to students in the district, and how important it was to retain them.  
However, the decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is matter reserved to 
the district’s discretion and is not subject to second-guessing in this proceeding.  (Rutherford 
v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167.) 
 
 
credential, and a National Board certification in Career and Technical Education, the highest 
credential a teacher can obtain.  She teaches .8 woodshop and .2 AVID and was unclear as to 
what portion of her job was being reduced.  The district is instructed to provide her with an 
explanation and understanding of her layoff notice.  
 
 
BCLAD, a NCLB certificate, 92 units of post-graduate courses, a degree which allows her to 
teach teachers, and who teaches honors courses, was stunned that QTEL would take precedence 
over her numerous degrees and experience.  Ms. Perez-Peters was the perfect example of the

kind of highly trained, deeply motivated, and tremendously dedicated teacher that districts lose 
because of budget constraints, skipping criteria, and seniority issues.  However, as Perez-Peters 
may also have been denied the opportunity to participate in QTEL, she may be certificated, 
competent and senior to a certificated employee who was skipped because of READ 180 or 
QTEL as discussed in Factual Finding No. 25 above.   
 

34. 

Louis Marrone has a PE credential, and is currently in the midst of completing 

the coursework necessary to earn a special education credential being 75 percent completed 
with his program.  Marrone teaches PE at Alta Vista Academy, a Level 12 and Level 14 facility 
which is the highest level of care for students outside of juvenile hall.  Marrone described the 
extensive training he has undergone in order to work with the students in this facility and the 
evidence clearly demonstrated that he possesses a set of skills and training that uniquely 
qualifies him to teach at Alta Vista Academy such that it was highly unlikely that other PE 
teachers without his training would be able to perform his job.  A junior employee possessing 
special competence can be retained over a senior employee lacking such competence.  
(Alexander v. Delano Joint Union High School District (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 567.)  No 
evidence was introduced to rebut Marrone’s assertion that his was the only school of its kind in 
the district, and that he had received training unique to his job requirements that no other PE 
teacher had received.  As such, it is recommended that the district rescind Marrone’s layoff 
notice and reinstate him.

the training and how it has significantly impacted and altered their approaches to teaching.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to Education Code sections 

2. 

44949 and 44955, and all notices and other requirements of those sections have been 
provided as required. 
 
 
A district may reduce services within the meaning of Education Code section 
44955, subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall 
not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that 
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to 
deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 
178-179.)

but that testimony was rebutted by that of Medina, and was insufficient to overcome Factual Finding Nos. 18-25.  

Ms. Bashkatova disputed the testimony of one of the respondents that QTEL was not offered to all teachers,

3. 

A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a 

continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to fill.  In doing so, the 
senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that position.  
(Lacy v. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469, 473-474.)  Junior teachers 
may be given retention priority over senior teachers only if the junior teachers possess 
superior skills or capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack.  (Santa Clara 
Federation of Teachers, Local 2393, v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified School 
District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831, 842-843.) 

 
4. 

 
Because of the reduction of particular kinds of services, cause exists pursuant 
to Education Code section 44955 to give notice to respondents that their services will not be 
required for the 2010-2011 school year.  The cause relates solely to the welfare of the 
schools and the pupils thereof within the meaning of Education Code section 44949.  The 
district has identified the certificated employees who are providing the particular kinds of 
services that the Governing Board directed be reduced or discontinued.  It is recommended 
that the Governing Board give respondents notice before May 15, 2009, that their services 
will not be required by the District for the school year 2010-11. 
 
 
accusation subject to the recommendations listed in the factual findings.   This determination 
is based on all factual findings and on all legal conclusions. 
 
 

A preponderance of the evidence sustained the charges set forth in the

RECOMMENDATION 
 
It is recommended that the governing board give notice to the respondents whose 

names are set forth below except for those respondents identified above in the Findings of 
Fact Nos. 25, 27, 28, 32, 33 and 34, that their employment will be terminated at the close of 
the current school year and that their services will not be needed for the 2010-2011 school 
year.
