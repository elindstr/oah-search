The Resolution established tie-breaker criteria for determining the

relative seniority of certified employees with the same date of first paid service. The
criteria, which are set forth in Exhibit A to the Resolution, provide that the order of
layoff shall be determined according to the following criteria:

1. Greatest number of years of teaching with a credential
issued with in the United States.

2. Breadth of credential authorization.

3. Advanced degrees in assignment or credential-related
subject areas.

4. Greatest number of post-BA accredited college units
on file with the District in assignment or credential-
related subject areas.

5. Date and time employee signed first employment
contract.

5.

The Resolution exempted from layoff the services of certificated

employees, regardless of seniority, who possess credentials that authorize services as
Special Education Teachers, Grades K-8; Speech and Language Specialists; and Math
Teachers. Respondents did not challenge this portion of the Resolution.

6.

Subsequent to the adoption of Resolution No. 10-11/#1, the District

reduced the number of FTEs being eliminated from 10.0 to 9.0.

7.

Between March 8 and March 10, 2011, the District provided written
notice to respondents, under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955,2 that their
services would not be required for the 2011-2012 school year. Each written notice set
forth the reasons for the District’s decision and noted that nine FTE positions would
be reduced or discontinued.

8.

On March 25, 2011, the District filed and thereafter served the

Accusation and related documents on respondents. Respondents thereafter timely
filed Notices of Defense, seeking a determination of whether cause exists for not
reemploying them for the 2011-2012 school year.

9.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.

10.

The services set forth in factual finding 3 are particular kinds of

services that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of section 44955.

2 All statutory citations are to the Education Code, unless indicated otherwise.

3

11.

The Board took action to reduce the services set forth in factual

finding 3 because of uncertainty surrounding future state funding. The decision to
reduce services was not related to the capabilities and dedication of the individuals
whose services are proposed to be reduced or eliminated. The decision to reduce the
particular kinds of services is related solely to the welfare of the District and its
pupils, and is neither arbitrary nor capricious but is rather a proper exercise of the
District’s discretion.

12.

At hearing, the District and respondent Durazo, through counsel,

stipulated that Durazo’s first date of paid probationary employment was September 1,
2003.

13.

At hearing, through counsel, respondent Asplund disputed his seniority

date of September 4, 1991. Asplund holds a clear single subject credential in art. He
admitted that he contracted for temporary certificated employment as a long-term
substitute on November 27, 1989, and that he did not work 75% of the 1989-1990
school year. He contended that he was rehired by the District for the 1990-1991
school year, and has been reemployed every school year since, but not under a
temporary employment contract, and that due to his probationary rather than
temporary status his seniority date should be September 4, 1990. The District
contended that Asplund held only a provisional credential before the 1991-1992
school year, and that Asplund’s first date of paid probationary employment for
purposes of seniority is September 4, 1991, after his credential status changed from
provisional to clear. The parties agree that the issue of respondent’s seniority date is
not dispositive of the District’s right to lay off respondent in these proceedings.

14.

At hearing, through counsel, respondent Hess disputed her seniority

date of September 5, 2001. Hess holds a clear single subject credential in
industrial/tech, with CLAD. She admitted that she contracted for probationary
certificated employment with a provisional credential in June 1997, and that her
employment in that capacity commenced on September 9, 1997. She contended that
her probationary status should have resulted in a seniority date of September 9, 1997,
regardless of the fact that she did not obtain a clear credential until after that date. The
District contended that Hess had a provisional credential when hired, that time served
on a provisional credential does not count toward seniority, and that Hess’s first date
of paid probationary employment for purposes of seniority is September 5, 2001. The
parties agree that the issue of respondent’s seniority date is not dispositive of the
District’s right to lay off respondent in these proceedings.

15.

Except as set forth in factual findings 13 and 14, there was no challenge

to the order of seniority on the seniority list.

16.

The District properly considered all known attrition, resignations,

retirements, and requests for transfer in determining the number of layoff notices to
be delivered to employees by March 15, 2011.

4

17.

The District did not retain any certificated employee junior to respondents

to render a service that respondents are certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

4.

5.

Jurisdiction for the subject proceeding exists under sections 44949 and

44955, by reason of factual findings 1 through 17.

The services listed in factual finding 3 are determined to be particular

kinds of services within the meaning of section 44955, by reason of factual findings 3
and 9.

3.

Cause exists under sections 44949 and 44955 for the reduction of the

particular kinds of services set forth in factual finding 3, which cause relates solely to
the welfare of the District's schools and pupils, by reason of factual findings 1 through
17.

Cause exists to terminate the services of respondents, by reason of

factual findings 1 through 17, and legal conclusions 1 through 3.

While time served under a provisional credential does not count toward

tenure, i.e., permanent status (§ 44911), a probationary employee, even one with a
provisional credential, does accrue seniority based on that employee’s first paid date
of probationary employment. (California Teachers Assn. v. Vallejo City Unified
School Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 135, 152-158.) Therefore, respondent Asplund’s
seniority date is September 4, 1990, and respondent Hess’s seniority date is
September 9, 1997, by reason of factual findings 13 and 14, respectively.

ORDER

The District may notify respondents Kreg Asplund, Jing Cai, Betty Durazo,

Teresa Hess, Respect Ly, Dana Martin, Deborah Pettus, Conner Ryan, and Sonia
Valencia that their services will not be required for the 2011-2012 school year due to
the reduction of particular kinds of services.
