FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Complainant Anthony Smith issued in the accusation in his official capacity as

superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District (district).

2.

3.

Respondents are certificated employees of the district. The respondents are

identified on Appendix A, attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

On March 9, 2011, the district’s governing board adopted Resolution No.

1011-0142, in which it resolved to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services for the
2011-2012 school year, and directed the superintendent to give notice to certificated
employees that their services would be reduced or eliminated at the end of the 2010-2011
school year. The resolution called for a 510.4 FTE (full-time equivalent) reduction in
particular kinds of services and, in addition, called for the elimination of all kindergarten
through 12th grade courses not accessible to English Language Learners, which would have
resulted in the further elimination of 28 FTE.

4.

On April 20, 2011, the governing board adopted Resolution No. 1011-0142A.

This resolution amended Resolution No. 1011-0142 by reducing, from 538.4 FTE to 95.2
FTE, the services to be reduced or eliminated, as follows:

5.

On or before March 15, 2010, the district gave written notice to respondents of

the recommendation that their services will not be required for the 2011-2012 school year.
The reasons for the recommendation were set forth in these preliminary layoff notices.

6.

Respondents filed timely requests for hearing to determine if there is cause for

terminating their services for the 2011-2012 school year. An accusation was served on
respondents, all of whom filed or are deemed to have filed timely notices of defense. All
prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.

Stipulations

7.

The district and the represented respondents reached stipulations on various
matters, including prehearing jurisdictional matters, the rescission of certain layoff notices,
the proper seniority dates of certain employees, and the reemployment rights of certain
employees. Those stipulations are set out in Exhibit 12. (Exhibit 12 is a hearing exhibit; no
exhibits are attached to this proposed decision.)

8.

9.

At hearing, it was stipulated that respondent Jessie McGee’s seniority date is

July 14, 1980, and that the district would rescind the layoff notice it issued to McGee.

At hearing, it was stipulated that the district would rescind the layoff notice it

issued to respondent Marla Winston.

Reductions in French

Seniority date issue

10.

Respondent Patrick Drovin teaches French at Skyline High School. He urges

the governing board to reconsider the proposed reductions in high school French, which
would be devastating to the foreign language program and its students.

11.

This is respondent Irene Kim’s first year as a district teacher. Her assigned

seniority date is August 30, 2010, the first day she rendered paid service under her teaching
contract with the district. Kim argues that her seniority date should be August 23, the date
she first attended professional development sessions. Kim was hired by the district on
August 19, 2010, and required to attend professional development sessions before the school
year started, from August 23 to August 27. She was paid a stipend for working those days
which was not part of her teaching salary.

Seniority is measured from the first date on which an employee renders paid service
in a probationary position. (Ed. Code, § 44845.) Even if attendance at the August training
was mandatory, it was not part of Kim’s service in a probationary position. Her teaching
contract began on August 30, not August 23, and she was paid a stipend for attending the
professional development sessions, not her salary as a probationary employee. Kim is not
entitled to an earlier seniority date.

Other matters

12.

The cause for the reduction in particular kinds of services relates to the welfare

of the schools and the pupils thereof.

13.

No permanent employee is being terminated while any probationary employee,

or any other employee with less seniority, is being retained to render a service which the
permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Cause exists to direct the district to correct its records to reflect that the

seniority date of respondent Jessie McGee is July 14, 1980, and to dismiss the accusation
against her. (Finding 8.)

Cause exists to dismiss the accusation against Marla Winston. (Finding 9.)

Cause exists because of the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of

services pursuant to Education Code section 44955 to give notice to the remaining
respondents that their services will not be required for the 2011-2012 school year. The cause
relates solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof within the meaning of
Education Code section 44949.
