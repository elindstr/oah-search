Respondents each made a timely request in writing for a hearing to determine 

approving criteria for determining the relative order of seniority of certificated employees 
with the same first date of paid service.  
 
 
On or before March 15, 2010, the Superintendent gave written notice to 
respondents that, pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, it was being 
recommended that their services be reduced or eliminated for the ensuing 2010-2011 school 
year.  The written notice set forth the reasons for the recommendation.  
 
 
if cause existed for not reemploying them for the 2010-2011 school year.   
 
Accusations were timely served on all respondents who requested a hearing, 
 
and each respondent filed a timely Notice of Defense except respondents Monika Becker, 
Alfred Garcia, Susan Johnston, Dean McNair, Laura Miller and Luann Zeterberg.  None of 
the respondents, except Alfred Garcia, who failed to file a timely Notice of Defense was 
present at hearing or sought relief from this failure.  Respondents Monika Becker, Susan 
Johnston, Dean McNair, Laura Miller and Luann Zeterberg have therefore waived their right 
to a hearing.  (Ed. Code, § 44949.)

2  District refused to waive the untimely filing of the Notice of Defense by Garcia and objected to 

his participation in the hearing.  After considering the evidence and the argument of counsel, it was 
determined that Garcia should be allowed to participate.  Garcia filed the initial request for hearing, 
therefore District had notice he wanted a hearing, and there was no evidence of any prejudice to District 
by the untimely filing.

12. 

Respondent Alfred Garcia holds a Multiple Subject Credential and a 

 
Crosscultural, Language and Academic Development Certificate (CLAD).  District has 
assigned Garcia a seniority date of August 21, 2006.  Garcia was first employed by District 
on September 14, 2005, as a long term substitute to teach Spanish.  On March 26, 2006, he 
was forced to relinquish his position with District after he was hit by a truck and broke his 
neck.  Garcia was rehired by District for the 2006-2007 school year and given a full-time 
temporary employee contract.  Garcia taught history and English Language Development 
(ELD) core courses.  Garcia was reemployed by District as a Probationary Employee II for 
the 2007-2008 school year, and worked for District during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 
school years.  He is now a tenured employee of District.  Garcia runs the ELD program.  He 
teaches four levels of ELD courses, including the basic level course which requires bilingual 
capabilities.  He also serves as chair of the ELD program, is on the English Language 
Advisory Committee (ELAC), serves as the liaison between District and Spanish speaking 
parents, and has put together programs designed to increase the parental involvement of the 
migrant population.  Garcia estimates that 20 percent of District is English Language 
Learners (ELL) and that 85 percent of the ELLs are Hispanic.  Garcia is one of only two or 
three individuals at District who speak Spanish.   
 
 
service as a temporary employee during the 2006-2007 school year.  Garcia believes his 
service as a long term substitute during the 2005-2006 school year should be included when 
calculating his seniority and that his seniority date should be September 14, 2005.  Garcia is 
mistaken.  He is not entitled to credit for his service as a long term substitute during the 
2005-2006 school year.  
 
 
 

13.  Garcia’s seniority date of August 21, 2006, reflects Garcia’s first date of paid 

Education Code section 44918 provides in pertinent part: 

(a)  Any employee classified as a substitute or temporary 
employee who serves during one school year for at least 75 
percent of the number of days the regular schools of the district 
were maintained in that school year and has performed the 
duties normally required of a certificated employee of the school 
district, shall be deemed to have served a complete school year 
as a probationary employee if employed as a probationary 
employee the following school year. 

Garcia was employed by District for less than 75 percent of the 2005-2006 school 

 
 
year and therefore is not entitled to credit for his service as a long term substitute during that 
school year.   
 
 
serving the Spanish speaking population.  However, Garcia concedes that the only 
requirements for his position are CLAD certification and a multiple subject credential.  There 

Garcia also believes that he should be retained because his position is critical to 

 

5

are certificated employees of District who are senior to Garcia who hold the necessary 
credential and certification. 
 

 

14.  Valerie Talley is a temporary employee of District.  She teaches a first and 

second grade combination class.  Talley was first hired by District on September 10, 1997, as 
a probationary employee.  She worked for District from 1997 to December 2003, when she 
took a one year leave of absence to relocate to another state due to her husband’s 
employment.  Talley was a permanent employee when she left District.  In December 2004 
Tally asked District if she could extend her leave of absence.  She was told that she could 
not.  Talley therefore resigned effective December 2004.  Talley subsequently returned to 
California and in the spring of 2007 applied for a position with District.  She did not receive 
a response.  In August 2008 Talley was hired by District as a temporary employee for the 
2008-2009 school year.  She was rehired as a temporary employee for the 2009-2010 school 
year.  Tally asked to be hired as a permanent employee for both the 2008-2009 and 2009-
2010 school years but was told by District personnel that District could not hire her as a 
permanent employee because there were too many teachers on leave.  Talley believes that 
she should be classified as a permanent employee and that her tenure date should relate back 
to when she was first hired in 1997 because District did not advise her when she resigned 
that she could “get her tenure back” if she were reemployed by District within 39 months of 
her resignation.3   
 
 
her seniority rights and Talley is not entitled to a 1997 seniority date.  When a permanent 
certificated employee resigns and is reemployed within 39 months, reemployment restores all 
of the individual rights, benefits and burdens of a permanent employee (i.e., the employee 
retains his or her permanent status); however, for seniority purposes, an employee does not 
regain his or her original hire date.  (San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 
627, 641.)  The date of employment or hire date of a certificated employee who resigns and 
is thereafter reemployed is the date on which the employee first renders paid service after 
reemployment.  (Ed. Code, § 44848.)  Thus, even if Tally had returned to District 
employment within 39 months of her resignation (which she did not), she would not have 
been entitled to a 1997 hire date.  Her hire date would have been the date on which she first 
rendered paid service to District following reemployment, in this case August 2008.  Nor is 
Talley entitled to classification as a permanent employee since she was not reemployed by 
District until August 2008, which was more than 39 months after her resignation.  Talley was 

15.  District’s failure to advise Talley of her reemployment rights did not prejudice 

                                                           

3  Talley failed to cite specific legal authority for her position, but appears to rely on Education 

Code section 44931, which states in pertinent part: 
 

Whenever any certificated employee of any school district who, at the 
time of his or her resignation, was classified as permanent, is reemployed 
within 39 months after his or her last day of paid service, the governing 
board of the district shall, disregarding the break in service, classify him 
or her as, and restore to him or her all of the rights, benefits and burdens 
of, a permanent employee, except as otherwise provided in this code.

The individuals listed on Exhibit B are all temporary employees.  Although 

hired by District as a temporary employee for the 2010-2011 school year and District acted 
properly in classifying her as a temporary employee in this proceeding. 
 
 
District contends these temporary employees do not have the right to a hearing, all were 
issued “precautionary” layoff notices.  With the exception of Valerie Talley, none of the 
listed temporary employees contested their temporary status or their hire dates.  Temporary 
teachers are not entitled to the Education Code section 44949/44955 rights afforded 
permanent and probationary teachers and generally may be summarily released.  (Taylor v. 
Bd. of Trustees (1984) 36 Cal.3d 500, 505; Ed. Code, § 44954.)  Those individuals listed on 
Exhibit B are therefore not entitled to a hearing with respect to their non-reemployment by 
District.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Each of the services set forth in Finding 4 is a kind which may be reduced or 
discontinued in accordance with applicable statutes and case law.  (See Ed. Code, § 44955; 
Campbell v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796; Degener v. Governing Bd. (1977) 67 
Cal.App.3d 689.)  The decision to reduce or discontinue the services is neither arbitrary nor 
capricious but rather a proper exercise of the District’s discretion.    
 
 
Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees at Livermore 
Valley Joint Unified School District due to the reduction or discontinuance of particular 
kinds of services pursuant to Education Code section 44955.  The cause relates solely to the 
welfare of the school and the pupils thereof within the meaning of Education Code section 
44949.

ORDER 

Notice may be given to respondents occupying up to 67.35 F.T.E. positions that their 

 
 
services will not be required for the 2010-2011 school year because of the reduction or 
discontinuation of particular kinds of services.
