PROPOSED  DECISION 

Administrative  Law  Judge  Steven  C.  Owyang,  State  of  California,  Office  of 

Administrative  Hearings,  heard  this  matter  in  Windsor,  California,  on  April  25,  2005. 

Noel  J.  Shumway,  General  Counsel,  School  and  College  Legal  Services,  represented 

the  West  Sonoma  County  Union  High  School  District. 

Respondent  Andy  Del  Monte  was  present  and  represented  by James  D.  Allen,  Esq. 

The  matter  was  submitted  on  April  25,  2005. 

FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

2. 

David  Wheeler,  Superintendent,  West  Sonoma  County  Union  High  School 

District,  made  and  filed  the  accusation  in  his  official  capacity. 

Respondent  Andy  Del  Monte  is  a  certificated  employee  of  the  district.  He 

holds  a  1.0  FTE  (full-time  equivalent)  position,  of  which  0:6  FTE  is  teaching  music. 
Respondent  works  at  Analy  High  School. 

3. 

On  March  9,  2005,  upon  the  recommendation  of  Superintendent  Wheeler,  the 

governing  board  adopted  Resolution  13.MAR.2004/05,  in  which  it  resolved  to  reduce  or 
discontinue  the  following  particular  kinds  of  services  (PKS)  for  the  2005-2006  school  year 

and  directed  the  superintendent  or  his  designee  to  initiate  and  pursue  procedures  nécessary  to  

not  reemploy  the  equivalent  of  three  full-time  equivalent  certificated  employees  of  the 
district: 

Secondary  Home  Economics/Independent  Study 
Secondary  Business/Home  Economics 
Secondary  Social  Science/Leadership

- 

0.8  FTE 
0.6  FTE 
0.6  FTE 
0.2  FTE 
0.2  FTE 
0.6  FTE 

TOTAL 

3.0  FTE 

4. 

The  governing  board  considered  attrition  that  occurred  up  to  March  9,  2005, 

in  its  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of  services.  Three  teachers,  none  of 
whom  teaches  music,  had  informed  the  district  that  they  would  be  retiring.  There  has  been 
no  attrition  after  March  9,  2005. 

5. 

At  its  March  9,  2005,  meeting,  the  governing  board  also  decided  to  release  all 

temporary  and  non-probationary  teachers. 

6. 

The  superintendent  recommended  the  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  services 

because  a  parcel  tax  that  provided  funding  to  the  district  had  not  been  renewed  in  a  March 
2005  election.  Another  effort  to  renew  the  parcel  tax  is  pending  in  an  upcoming  June  2005 
election,  which  if  successful  may  obviate  the  need  for  some  or  all  of  the  proposed  reductions. 

7. 

The  superintendent  timely  served  respondent  with  a  notice  of  layoff. 

Respondent  was  timely  served  an  accusation,  statement  to  respondent,  notice  of  defense, 
notice  of  hearing,  and  relevant  statutes.  Respondent  made  a  timely  request  for  hearing  and 
timely  notice  of  defense. 

8. 

Respondent  was  previously  a  tenured  employee  of  the  district,  but  resigned 

his  position  on  August  1,  2000,  shortly  after  the  birth  of  his  son.  Respondent  returned  to  the 
district  on  February  28,  2001. 

9. 

Education  Code  section  44848  provides  that  when  an  employee  such  as 

respondent  shall  have  resigned  and  thereafter  been  reemployed,  his  date  of  employment  shall 
be  deemed  to  be  the  date  he  first  rendered  paid  service  after  his  reemployment.  In 
respondent’s  case,  that  date  was  February  28,  2001.  That  date  is  respondent’s  correct 
seniority  date. 

10. 

‘In  January  every  year,  the  district  circulates  its  seniority  list  to  its  teachers, 

and  asks  teachers  to  raise  any  issues  or  questions  they  might  have  about  their  listed  seniority 
dates  or  credentials.  Respondent  has  received  the  seniority  list  and  has  not  previously 
questioned  his  February  28,  2001,  seniority  date.

11. 

Respondent  was  under  the  impression  from  conversations  he  had  with  Analy 

High  School  principal  Martin  Webb  that  he  would  return  to  the  district  with  his  previous 
seniority  date.  Principal  Webb  did  not  recall  telling  respondent  that  he  would  come  back 
with  his  previous  seniority  date.  Webb  doubts  that  he  would  have  said  anything  about  the 
seniority  issue,  since  he  typically  defers  such  questions  to  the  district’s  human  resources 
office..  The  evidence  did  not  establish  that  Webb  made  any  representations  to  respondent 
about  his  seniority  date.  In  any  event,  Education  Code  section  44848  is  controlling  on  the 
matter. 

12. 

|  Respondent  holds  a  1.0  FTE  position,  of  which  0.6  is  for  teaching  music.  He 
will  be  retained  in  a  0.4  FTE  non-music  position.  No  permanent  or  probationary  employee 
with  less  seniority  is  being  retained  to  render  a  service  for  which  respondent  is  certificated 
and  competent. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

Cause  exists  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  for  not 

reemploying  respondent  in  a  0.6  FTE  music  position  for  the  2005-2006  school  year.  The 
cause  for  not  reemploying  respondent  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  district  and  the 
pupils  thereof. 

Notice  may  be  given  to  respondent  that  his  services  will  not  be  required  for  a  0.6  FTE 

music  position  for  the  2005-2006  school  year.
