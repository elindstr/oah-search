FACTUAL FINDINGS

Superintendant, made and filed the Accusation dated March 8, 2011, while acting in
his official capacity as the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources, Chino Valley
Unified School District (the District).

2.

Respondents1 are certificated district employees.

1

At the conclusion of the hearing, the 81 respondents listed in Appendix A

remained subject to layoff pursuant to the reduction in force (RIF) proceedings.

1

3.

On February 17, 2011, the District’s Board of Education (Board)

adopted Resolution No. 2010/2011-31, determining that it would be necessary to
reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services at the end of the current school year.
The Board determined that the particular kinds of services that must be reduced for
the 2011-2012 school year were the following full time equivalent (FTE) positions:

The parties do not dispute the fact that the services listed above are

particular kinds of services, which may be reduced or discontinued within the
meaning of Education Code section 44955.

4.

The Board further determined in Resolution No. 2010/2011-31, that

pursuant to the resolution and Education Code section 44955, “. . .an exception from
the order of layoff will be sought because of the special training and experience of
certain certificated employees who are assigned to teach a course of study or to fulfill
a particular administrative task which others with more seniority do not possess.”

2

The Board properly elected to skip those certificated employees due to valid needs of
the District and its students.

5.

The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the services listed in
Finding 3, above, is neither arbitrary nor capricious; rather, it is due to substantial
decreases in the operating budget, and is, therefore, a proper exercise of the Board’s
discretion. The reduction and discontinuation of services is related to the welfare of
the District and its pupils, and it has become necessary to decrease the number of
certificated employees as determined by the Board. No particular kinds of services
were lowered to levels less than those levels mandated by state or federal law.

6.

On March 8, 2011, the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources,
timely notified respondents, pursuant to California Education Code sections 44949
and 44955, of the District’s intent not to reemploy them for the upcoming school year.
That same date, March 8, 2011, respondents were also served with a copy of the
Accusation, Statement to Respondent, the resolution, a blank Notice of Defense and
other related materials. Accordingly, all respondents affected by the layoffs received
written notice, on or before March 15, 2011, notifying them that the Board had
recommended they not be re-employed in the upcoming, 2011-2012, school year.

7.

The Superintendent and District considered all positively assured

attrition, including resignations, retirements and requests for transfer, in determining
the actual number of necessary layoff notices to be delivered to its employees.

8.

Each respondent either timely filed Notices of Defense or if not, the

Superintendent waived his objections to untimely filings.

Each respondent was properly noticed of the date, time and place of the

9.
instant hearing.

10.

11.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.

At the commencement of the hearing, counsel for the District

announced that due to the non-adoption of the Charter School Resolution, the District
could meet the current budget deficit by reducing the K-8 Classroom Teaching FTE’s
from 57.00 to 42.00. Consequently, the number of respondents was reduced to the 81
named in Appendix “A.”

12.

The respondents identified in Appendix “A” have been selected for

notice of layoff pursuant to the list, which is based on the first day of paid service of
each respondent. The respondents were ranked for layoff in the inverse order of their
date of employment.

13.

“TieBreak Criteria” were created by the Board and were adopted as

part of Resolution number 2010/2011-31.

3

14.

One respondent, Brett Jensen, questioned the use of the TieBreak

criteria. Mr. Jensen testified that he has a single subject math credential and does not
understand why two other math teachers with the same seniority date were retained
and he was not. A review of the seniority list reveals that the other two math teachers
who share Mr. Jensen’s seniority date have a “Found. [Foundational] Math”
credential, while Mr. Jensen does not. One of the TieBreak criterion allows “1 point
for each current, valid credential.” Accordingly, the two math teachers with the same
seniority date each have one more point than does Mr. Jensen. Consequently, the
TieBreak criteria adopted by the Board were properly utilized and resulted in Mr.
Jensen being notified of potential layoff as opposed to the other math teachers who
share his seniority date.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949

and 44955. All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections
were satisfied.

2.

A district may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall
not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by
determining that proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer
employees are made available to deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board
of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 178-179.)

3.

Pursuant to section 44995, a senior teacher whose position is

discontinued has the right to transfer to a continuing position which he or she is
certificated and competent to fill. In doing so, the senior employee may displace or
“bump” a junior employee who is filling that position. (Lacy v. Richmond Unified
School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469

The district has an obligation under section 44955, subdivision (b), to
determine whether any permanent employee whose employment is to be terminated in
an economic layoff possesses the seniority and qualifications which would entitle
him/her to be assigned to another position. (Bledsoe v. Biggs Unified School Dist.,
supra. at 136-137.)

4.

The decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is not

tied in with any statistical computation. It is within the governing authority’s
discretion to determine the amount by which a particular kind of service will be
reduced or discontinued as long as the district does not reduce a service below the
level required by law. (San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627,
635-636.) A school district has wide discretion in setting its budget and a layoff
decision will be upheld unless it was fraudulent or so palpably unreasonable and

4

arbitrary as to indicate an abuse of discretion as a matter of law. (California Sch.
Employees Assn. v. Pasadena Unified Sch. Dist. (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 318, 322.)

The services listed in Factual Finding 3 are each determined to be a

particular kind of service within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.

Based on the Factual Findings, considered in their entirety, cause exists

to reduce the number of certified employees of the District for budgetary reasons.

Cause to reduce or discontinue services relates solely to the welfare of

the District and its pupils within the meaning of Education Code section 44949.

Respondent Jensen was properly selected for layoff.

Cause exits to give the respondent’s listed in Appendix “A” that their

services are not needed for the ensuing, 2011-2012, school year.

ADVISORY DETERMINATION

The following advisory determination is made:

Prior to May 15, 2011, notice shall be given to the respondents listed in
Appendix “A” that their services will not be required for the ensuing school year due
to the budget deficit and the resulting need to reduce and/or discontinue certain
services.
