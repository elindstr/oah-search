FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

The  ALJ  makes  the  following  Factual  Findings: 

1. 

On  March  3,  2004,  the  Board  of  Education  of  the  District  (“the  Board”) 

adopted  a  resolution  recommending  a  reduction  in  particular  kinds  of  services 
provided  by  the  district  for  the  2004-2005  school  year  due  to  a  decline  in  the  average 
daily  attendance  in  the  district.  (Exhibit  9.)  The  resolution  called  for  a  reduction  in 
services  equaling  415  Full-Time  Equivalent  (“FTE”)  positions.  Later,  on  March  3, 
2004,  the  number  of  FTE’s  was  reduced  from  415  to  294.  The  revised  resolution 
called  for  the  following  reductions  in  Particular  Kinds  of  Services  (“PKS”): 

Decline  in  Average  Daily  Attendance  (K-5)

The  parties  do  not  dispute  the  fact  that  the  services  listed  above  are  particular 

kinds  of  services,  which  may  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of 
Education  Code  section  44955. 

2. 

The  district's  and  the  Board’s  decisions  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the 

services  listed  in  Finding  1,  above,  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious;  rather,  it  is  due 
to  the  decline  in  average  daily  attendance;  and,  is;  therefore,  a  proper  exercise  of  the 
district's  and  the  Board’s  discretion(s). 

3. 

The  reduction  and  discontinuation  of  services  is  related  to  the  welfare 
of  the  district  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of 
certificated  employees  as  determined  by  the  Board. 

4. 

All  respondents.  affected  by  the  layoffs  received  written  notice,  on  or 

before  March  15,  2004,  notifying  them  that  the  Superintendent  of  the  district  had 
recommended  they  not  be  re-employed  in  the  upcoming,  2004-2005,  school  year. 

5. 

Each  respondent  submitted  a  timely  request  for  a  hearing  to  determine 

if  cause  exists  for  not  re-employing  them  for  the  ensuing  year. 

6. 

On  March  12,  2004  the  district's  Superintendent,  on  behalf  of  the 
district,  timely  notified  the  respondents,  pursuant  to  California  Education  Code 
sections  44949  and  44955,  of  the  district’s  intent  not  to  reemploy  them  for  the 
upcoming  school  year.  That  same  date,  March  12,  2004,  respondents  were  also 
served  with  a  copy  of  the  Board’s  resolution,  resolution  number  03/04-2555,  a  blank 
“Request  for  Hearing”  and  other  related  materials. 

7. 

Subsequently,  on  April  2,  2004,  the  Accusation  and  related  materials 

were  served  on  each  respondent.

® 

Each  respondent  timely  submitted  a  Notice  of  Defense. 

8. 

9. 

10. 

11. 

Each  respondent  was  properly  noticed  of  the  date,  time  and  place  of  the 

instant  hearing.  Any  respondent  who  failed  to  appear  at  the  instant  hearing  was 
properly  noticed  of  the  hearing. 

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met. 

As  of  the  date  of  hearing  the  number  of  certificated  employees  affected 

by  the  layoffs  was  reduced  to  31,  due  to  attrition  (retirements,  etc.).  The  following 
respondents  remain:

The  respondents  identified  in  Finding  11  have  been  selected  for  notice 

of  layoff  pursuant  to  a  seniority  list  based  on  the  first  day  of  paid  service  of  each 
respondent.  The  respondents  were  ranked  for  layoff  in  the  inverse  order  of  their  date 
of  employment.  As  to  respondents  who  have  the  same  date  of  hire/employment,  the 
district  used  appropriate,  written,  tie-breaking  criteria  to  rank  those  employees. 

13. 

Certain  respondents  identified  in  Finding  11  question  the  dates  used  by 

the  Board  and  the  district  as  their  “Seniority  Date”.  Some  respondents  believe  they 
should  have  received  credit  for  the  time  they  worked  under  emergency  credentials, 
some  believe  they  should  receive  credit  for  the  time  they  worked  as  Interns,  and  some 
believe  they  should  be  credited  for  the  time  they  worked  as  Pre-Interns.

Hernandez,  Kristan  (Intern  date:  9/1/03;  prelim.  Credential:

Smith,  Jason  (Intern  date:  9/2003;  prelim.  Credential:  1/3/04; 
seniority  date:  1/3/04) 

14. 

The  respondents  listed  in  Finding  13  did  not  receive  any  credit  for  the 

time  they  worked  under  their  emergency  credentials,  or  as  Pre-Interns.  Of  the  Interns, 
only  Hernandez  received  credit  for  service  as  an  intern.  The  decision  whether  to  grant 
credit  for  the  categories  listed  in  Finding  13  was  pursuant  to  district  policy.  As 
testified  to  by  the  Senior  Director  of  Certificated  Personnel,  individuals  working 
under  a  Pre-Intern  credential  or  emergency  credential  were  not  credited  for  that  work 
in  calculating  seniority.  Instead,  they  were  given  a  seniority  date  based  on  the  first 
date  of  paid  service  after  having  obtained  their  preliminary  or  clear  credentials. 
Interns  working  under  a  district  intern  credential  or  a  university  intern  credential, 
however,  were  supposed  to  be  given  credit  for  up  to  one  year  service  under  the  Intern 
credentials  provided  the  service  was  rendered  during  the  academic  year  immediately 
preceding  the  date  upon  which  they  received  their  preliminary  or  clear  credential. 
This  did  not  happen  in  the  case  of  Barrera,  Monica;  Olamendi,  Gloria;  Silva,  Blanca; 
or,  Smith,  Jason. 

15.  |  Of  great  concern  in  the  present  case  is  “what  happened  to  the  Assistant 
Principals  who  were  originally  listed  on  the  seniority  list  for  layoff?”  As  of  the  latest 
revision  in  the  PKS  being  “cut”  there  were  7  FTE  in  the  Assistant  Principal  category. 
According  to  the  evidence,  20  FTE  Assistant  Principal  positions  were  originally  slated 
to  be  cut.  This  was  reduced  to  7  FTE  due  to  attrition/retirements.  None  of  the  7 
Assistant  Principals  listed  on  the  amended  seniority  list,  however,  are  listed  on  the 
final  list  of  31  employees,  Exhibit  23,  the  respondents  in  this  action,  even  though  4  of 
the  7  Assistant  Principals  are  probationary  contract  employees  and  have  less  seniority 
than  some  of  the  31  respondents.  Specifically,  Martinez,  Danny  R.  (Assistant 
Principal)  has  a  seniority  date  of  6/2/03;  Johnson,  Adelea  (Assistant  Principal)  has  a 
seniority  date  of  8/1/03;  Carlisle  Sights,  Bruce  (Assistant  Principal)  has  a  seniority 
date  of  9/2/03;  and,  Oishi,  Todd  D.  (Assistant  Prinicpal)  has  a  seniority  date  of  9/5/03. 
A  review  of  the  “list  of  31”  (Exhibit  23)  reveals  that  the  most  senior  respondent  on  the 
list,  Head  William,  has  a  seniority  date  of  2/3/03  and  has  more  seniority  than  any  of 
the  four  Assistant  Principals  who  disappeared  from  the  seniority  list.  There  are  18 
other  respondents  on  the  “list  of  31”  who  are  as  senior,  or  more  senior,  than  the  least

  

senior  Assistant  Principal  (seniority  dates  on  or  before  9/5/03).  The  Senior  Director 
of  Certificated  Personnel  testified  that  although  7  Assistant  Principals  received  layoff 
notices,  they  all  “bumped  back  into  the  classroom”  and  that  is  why  no  Assistant 
Principals  appear  on  the  “list  of  31”. 
impossible  to  determine  whether  the  rules  of  seniority  and  the  “bumping”  procedures 
were  properly  followed.  The  district  erred  in  not  providing  sufficient  evidence  to 
reveal  how  the  Assistant  Principals  came  to  be  retained  over  more  senior,  similarly 
credentialed  respondents  on  the  “list  of  31”.  Accordingly,  it  can  not  be  said  that  no 
employee  with  less  creditable  employment  service  with  the  district,  than  the 
respondents  listed  in  Finding  11,  has  been  retained  to  render  a  service,  which  any 
respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

Based  on  the  evidence  presented,  it  is 

16. 

|  According  to  the  Senior  Director  of  Certificated  Personnel  respondent 

Lopez,  Delia  should  not  have  received  a  layoff  (RIF)  notice  and  that  RIF  notice 
should  be  rescinded. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1, 

Jurisdiction  for  the  instant  proceedings  exists  pursuant  to  Education 

Code  sections  44949  and  44955,  and  all  notices  and  other  requirements  of  those 
sections  have  been  provided,  as  required. 

2. 

The  services  listed  in  Factual  Finding  1  are  each  determined  to  be  a 

particular  kind  of  service  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955. 

3. 

Based  on  the  Factual  Findings,  considered  in  their  entirety,  cause  exists 
to  reduce  the  number  of  certified  employees  of  the  district  by  31.0  full-time  equivalent 
positions,  due  to  the  decline  in  average  daily  attendance.  (Finding  2) 

4, 

Cause  to  reduce  or  discontinue  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of 
the  district's  schools  and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949. 
(Finding  3) 

5. 

The  district  was  correct  in  not  granting  teachers  credit  for  the  time 

For  example,  under  Education  Code 

worked  on  an  emergency  or  Pre-Intern  basis. 
section  44911  time  spent  teaching  under  an  emergency  credential  cannot  be  counted  in 
computing  an  employee's  progress  toward  permanent  status  unless  the  employee  was 
credentialed  in  another  state  and  demonstrated  adequate  basic  skills  proficiency  pending 
successful  completion  of  the  California  Basic  Educational  Skills  Test  (CBEST).  By 
analogy  it  seems  that  the  same  principles  should  apply  to  accruing  seniority  while 
working  under  emergency  and  Pre-Intern  credentials.  (See  also  Lori  Summerfield  v. 
Windsor  Unified  School  District  (2002)  95  Cal.App.4™  1026.)  Pursuant  to  the  district’s 
own  policy,  however,  Interns  should  be  credited  for  up  to  one  year  service  under  their 
Intern  credentials  provided  the  service  was  rendered  during  the  academic  year

  

immediately  preceding  the  date  upon  which  they  received  their  preliminary  or  clear 
credential.  Consequently,  of  those  certificated  employees  listed  in  Finding  13,  four  of 
the  teachers  who  worked  as  Interns  should  have  their  seniority  dates  corrected,  as 
follows: 

1. 

Barrera’s  seniority  date  should  be  corrected  from  1/20/04  to  the 

specific  day  in  October,  2003  that  she  began  as  an  Intern; 

2. 

Olamendi’s  seniority  date  should  be  corrected  from  12/17/03  to 
9/23/03  (or  the  dated  established  by  employment  records  as  the  date  she  began  as  an 
Intern); 

3. 

Silva’s  seniority  date  should  be  corrected  from  11/25/03  to  the 

specific  day  in  September,  2003  that  she  began  as  an  Intern;  and, 

4. 

Smith’s  seniority  date  should  be  corrected  from  11/25/03  to  the 

specific  day  in  September,  2003  that  he  began  as  an  Intern. 

6. 

Based  on  Finding  15,  the  ALJ  concludes  that  it  is  impossible  to 

determine  if  “bumping  rights”  and  seniority  principles  were  properly  applied  in 
allowing  certain  of  the  less  senior  Assistant  Principals  to  “bump  back  into  the 
classroom”  while  other,  more  senior  teachers  remained  on  the  “list  of  31”. 
Consequently,  what  is  commonly  referred  to  as  the  “Domino  effect”  shall  apply  and 
all  employees  on  the  “list  of  31”  as  senior,  or  more  senior,  than  the  least  senior 
Assistant  Principal  who  “bumped”  into  the  classroom  (seniority  dates  on  or  before 
9/5/03) 
applies  to  the  following  employees  on  the  “list  of  31”: 

shall  be  deemed  reemployed  and  their  layoff  notices  shall  be  rescinded.  This

Note:  Due  to  the  corrections  to  the  seniority  list  which  must  occur 

based  on  the  factual  findings  and  legal  conclusion  5,  it  is  unclear  whether  two  of  the 
employees,  Silva  and  Smith  should  be  included  in  the  “Domino  effect”  list. 
According  to  the  ALJ’s  notes,  they  testified  that  they  were  hired  as  Interns  in 
September  of  2003.  The  exact  day  they  were  hired  was  not  established  at  the  hearing. 
Accordingly,  if  a  review  of  district  records  reveals  they  began  working  as  Interns  on 
or  before  9/5/03,  then  they  shall  be  included  with  the  others  on  the  above,  “Domino 
effect”  list. 

ORDER 

WHEREFORE,  THE  FOLLOWING  ORDER  is  hereby  made: 

1. 

The  Accusation  is  sustained,  in  part.  The  district  may  notify  the 

following  respondents  that  their  services  will  not  be  needed  during  the  2004-2005 
school  year  due  to  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of  services: 

2. 

The  Accusation  is  dismissed  as  to  the  following  respondents,  and  the 

district  may  not  notify  those  respondents  that  their  services  will  not  be  needed  during 
the  2004-2005  school  year:

dismissed  as  to  them.  If,  however,  respondent(s)  has/have  an  employment  date,  as  an 
intern,  after  9/5/03,  then  the  accusation  is  sustained  as  to  respondent(s)  and  the 
district  may  notify  respondent(s)  that  his/her/their  services  will  not  be  needed  during 
the  2004-2005  school  year  due  to  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of
