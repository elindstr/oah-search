On  March  10,  2008,  Superintendent  McVeigh  notified  the  Governing  Board 
that  she  recommended  that  notices  be  provided  to  certificated  employees  corresponding  to 
23.5  FTE  positions,  and  that,  as  a  precaution,  notices  also  be  provided  to  certificated 
employees  corresponding  to  an  additional  10.8  FTE  positions.

5. 

On  March  11,  2008,  the  District  provided  notice  to  Respondents  that  their 

services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  or 
discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  District  sent  notices  to  employees 
corresponding  to  23.5  FTE  positions.”  The  District  also  sent  notices,  as  a  precaution,  to 
employees  corresponding  to  an  additional  10.8  FTE  positions.> 

6. 

Respondents  contend  the  precautionary  notices  for  the  10.8  FTE  positions 
should  be  dismissed  because  they  are  in  excess  of  the  24.5  FTE  reduction  authorized  by 
Resolution  020.  This  contention  is  not  persuasive.  The  purpose  of  the  initial  notice  of  non- 
reemployment  is  to  notify  employees  of  the  probability  that  their  services  will  not  be 
required  for  the  ensuing  school  year  so  that  they  may  consider  looking  elsewhere  for 
employment.  (Moreland  Teachers  Assn.  v.  Kurze  (1980)  109  Cal.App.3d  648,  653.)  In 
order  to  ensure  that  all  employees  who  potentially  may  be  affected  by  a  layoff  receive  proper 
notice,  it  is  often  necessary  for  a  school  district  to  notice  more  employees  than  will  actually 
be  laid  off.  Such  broad  noticing  may  be  necessary  when  issues  of  seniority,  bumping,  etc. 
have  not  been  finally  determined  by  the  statutory  deadline  for  issuing  layoff  notices.  In  this 
case,  there  is  no  evidence  the  District  will  eliminate  more  positions  than  those  authorized  in 
Resolution  020.  The  District  has  indicated  it  would  rescind  the  precautionary  notices  to  the 
extent  they  are  not  needed  to  accomplish  the  reduction  of  23.5  FTE  positions. 

7. 

(A)  The  following  Respondents,  who  were  present  at  the  hearing,  filed  timely 

requests  for  hearing  to  determine  if  there  was  cause  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  2008- 
2009  school  year:  Jill  Coley,  Jessica  DeZure,  David  Foldvary,  Jennifer  Gilmour,  Jeffrey 
Harris,  Afi  Kashanian,  Ellen  Kwon,  Ryan  Lisko,  Jesse  Meyen,  Minjung  Pai,  Susan  Pastor, 
Keith  Rust,  Jennifer  Shin,  Maria  Stefanopoulos,  David  Summers,  Sarah  Wolff,  Heather 
Woodring  and  Frances  Young. 

2  Resolution  020  authorizes a  total  reduction  of  24.5  FTE  positions.  However,  the 
reduction  in  French  Teaching  Services  was  changed  from  1.6  FTE  to  1.0  FTE,  and  the  0.4 
FTE  reduction  in  Adult  Education  ESL  Coordinator  Services  was  no  longer  needed.  Thus, 
the  District  sent  notices  to  employees  corresponding  to  23.5  FTE  positions. 

3  Timothy  Briggs  is  as  an  employee  who  was  sent  a  precautionary  notice 

corresponding  to  a  reduction  of  0.6  FTE.  However,  Briggs  is  not  named  as  a  Respondent  in 
the  Accusation  and,  therefore,  is  not  part  of  this  case. 

Nicole  Currie  is  identified  as  corresponding  to  a  reduction  of  0.6  FTE,  and  also  as 

receiving  a  precautionary  notice  for  a  reduction  of  1.0  FTE.  The  evidence  established  Currie 
is  being  bumped  by  a  more  senior  employee  from  her  0.6  FTE  position  in  physical  education, 
but  she  is  being  retained  for  her  0.4  FTE  position  in  the  dance  program  pursuant  to  Education 
Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (d).  Therefore,  for  purposes  of  this  decision,  Currie  will  be 
considered  as  part  of  the  23.5  FTE  reduction,  but  she  will  not  be  considered  as  a  Respondent 
who  received  a  precautionary  notice. 

  

 

  

(B)  The  following  Respondents  filed  timely  requests  for  hearing,  but  were  not 
present  at  the  hearing:  Paige  Adams,  Danielle  Behr,  Ashley  Bowles,  Emily  Buchen,  Preston 
Joseph,  Mahnaz  Kheraj,  Alyssa  Para,  Emmanuelle  Rousseaux  and  Phillip  Wagner. 

(C)  Respondent  Bradley  Harris  filed  his  request  for  hearing  one  day  late. 

Respondent  Gena  Schmidt  did  not  file  a  request  for  hearing  but  was  present  at  the  hearing. 
The  District  stipulated  to  allow  Respondents  Harris  and  Schmidt  to  participate  in  this 
proceeding. 

8. 

The  following  Respondents  did  not  file  a  request  for  hearing  and  were  not 

present  at  the  hearing:  Barbara  Bader,  Dana  Berk,  Rebecca  Bode,  Nicole  Currie,  Richard 
Tolfo,  and  Dina  Yoseph.  Consequently,  these  Respondents  waived  their  right  to  a  hearing 
and  cannot  contest  the  recommendation  of  their  non-reemployment  by  the  District.  (Ed. 
Code,  §44949,  subd.  (b).)

9. 

On  April  3,  2008,  the  District  issued  the  Accusation  and  served  it  on 

Respondents.  The  District  received  notices  of  defense  from  25  Respondents. 

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  have  been  met. 

The  services  set  forth  in  Finding  3  are  particular  kinds  of  services  which  may 

be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955. 

12. 

The  Governing  Board  took  action  to  reduce  the  services  set  forth  in  Finding  3 

primarily  due  to  financial  difficulties  and  budgetary  problems.  The  decision  to  reduce  or 
discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious  but  is  rather  a 
proper  exercise  of  the  District's  discretion. 

13. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  services  set  forth  in  Finding  3  is  related  to 
the  welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number 
of  certificated  employees  as  determined  by  the  Governing  Board. 

14. 

On  February  26,  2008,  the  Governing  Board,  in  Resolution  020,  adopted 
criteria  for  determining  seniority  among  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  in  a 
probationary  position  on  the  same  date  (tie-breaking  criteria).  The  tie-breaking  criteria  are 
reasonable  as  they  relate  to  the  skills  and  qualifications  of  certificated  employees.  The 
criteria  themselves  were  not  challenged  by  Respondents. 

15. 

The  District  properly  created  its  seniority  list  by  determining  the  first  date  of 

paid  service  in  probationary  status  of  each  certificated  employee  and  properly  utilized  the

  

tie-breaking  criteria  when  necessary.  The  parties  stipulated  that  the  District  implemented 
Resolution  020  in  the  manner  documented  in  the  Certificated  Seniority  List,  which  was 
admitted  at  the  hearing  as  Exhibit  12.* 

16. 

The  District  properly  considered  all  known  attrition,  resignations,  retirements 
and  requests  for  transfer  in  determining  the  actual  number  of  necessary  layoff  notices  to  be 
delivered  to  employees  by  March  15,  2008.  (San  Jose  Teachers  Association  v.  Allen  (1983) 
144  Cal.App.3d  627,  636.) 

17. 

As  of  February  26,  2008,  all  temporary  and  substitute  certificated  employees 
were  notified  of  their  non-reelection  for  the  next  school  year  and  were  released  effective  the 
end  of  the  current  school  year  (2007-2008). 

18. 

Respondent  Jessica  DeZure  (#61)  holds  a  preliminary  single  subject  credential 
(English).  The  District  contends  her  seniority  date  is  October  1,  2006.  DeZure  contends  she 
is  entitled  to  a  seniority  date  of  August  23,  2006.  DeZure  was  hired  on  August  23,  2006,  as  a 
long-term  substitute  for  the  2006-2007  school  year.  At  that  time,  DeZure  contends  she 
attended  a  staff  meeting  and  programs,  but  no  evidence  was  presented  she  was  paid  for 
attending  those  events.  DeZure  was  reclassified  as  a  temporary  employee  effective  October 
1,  2006,  and  worked  in  that  classification  for  the  remainder  of  the  2006-2007  school  year. 
DeZure  contends  her  duties  and  assignment  did  not  change  when  she  was  reclassified  from 
long-term  substitute  to  temporary  employee.  For  the  2007-2008  school  year,  DeZure  is  a 
probationary  employee  ("Prob  2"  status). 

Alex  Morefesis  (#69)  and  Heather  Lucas  (#70)  each  have  a  seniority  date  of 

Prior  to  creating  the  seniority  list,  the  District  sent  notices  to  its  employees, 
including  DeZure,  of  their  seniority  date,  employment  status,  assignment,  and  credentials 
held,  and  requested  the  employees  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  information  on  file  and  notify 
the  District  if  they  disagreed  with  their  information  on  file.  The  District  did  not  receive  a 
response  from  DeZure  contesting  her  October  1,  2006  seniority  date.  The  District  is 
presumed  to  have  carried  out  its  duty  of  correctly  determining  DeZure's  seniority  date  as 
October  1,  2006.  (Evid.  Code,  §  664.)  DeZure  did  not  present  sufficient  evidence  to 
establish  she  is  entitled  to  a  seniority  date  of  August  23,  2006.  (Evid.  Code,  §  500.) 

August  23,  2006,  and  hold  a  preliminary  single  subject  credential  (English)  as  well  as  an 
emergency  CLAD  credential.  DeZure  has  applied  for,  but  does  not  currently  have,  a  CLAD 
credential.  Even  if  DeZure  had  a  seniority  date  of  August  23,  2006,  she  would  be  less  senior 
to  Morefesis  and  Lucas  based  on  the  application  of  tie-breaking  criteria  pertaining  to 
credentials. 

    

*  For  ease  of  reference,  Respondents  and  other  employees  are  identified  herein  by 

their  corresponding  number  on  the  Certificated  Seniority  List  (Exhibit  12). 

  

  

 

  

19. 

Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (b),  provides  in  pertinent  part: 

Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  statute,  the  services  of  no  permanent  employee  may 
be  terminated  under  the  provisions  of  this  section  while  any  probationary  employee, 
or  any  other  employee  with  less  seniority,  is  retained  to  render  a  services  which  said 
permanent  employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

20. 

In  Respondents'  letter  brief  dated  April  25,  2008,  it  is  argued  that  Respondents 

Gena  Schmidt  (#67),  Susie  Pastor  (#66),  Minjung  Pai  (#65),  Paige  Adams  (#116),  Jennifer 
Gilmour  (#114),  Afarin  Kashanian  (#115),  Ellen  Kwon  (#107),  Sarah  Wolff  (#106),  and 
Heather  Woodring  (#119),  who  each  hold  a  multiple  subject  credential,  must  be  retained  by 
the  District  because  they  are  senior  to  employee  Jumi  Yang  (#96),  who  also  holds  a  multiple 
subject  credential  and  is  being  retained  by  the  District. 
This  argument  cannot  be  sustained. 
Yang,  who  has  a  seniority  date  of  August  23,  2006,  currently  teaches  middle  school  English 
(0.4  FTE)  and  Social  Studies  (0.6  FTE)  in  a  departmentalized  setting.  A  multiple  subject 
credential,  by  itself,  does  not  allow  a  teacher  to  perform  Yang's  assignment.  A  teacher  must 
also  have  authorization  from  a  local  governing  board  pursuant  to  Education  Code  section 
44256,  subdivision  (b),  and  the  teacher  must  consent  to  the  assignment.  Yang  has  the 
required  authorization  and  has  consented  to  this  assignment.  No  evidence  was  presented  that 
the  nine  Respondents  have  received  local  board  authorization  or  have  given  their  consent  to 
teach  middle  school  English  or  Social  Studies  in  a  departmentalized  setting.  The  granting  of 
local  authorization  under  section  44256  is  discretionary  with  the  local  governing  board.  It 
was  not  established  that  these  nine  Respondents  are  currently  "certificated  and  competent  to 
render"  the  service  Yang  is  currently  performing.  (Ed.  Code,  §  44955,  subd.  (b).) 

21. 

Randy  Hurwitz  (#10)  is  a  fourth  grade  teacher  who  is  classified  by  the  District 

as  a  temporary  employee  and  will  be  released  at  the  end  of  the  current  school  year. 
Respondents  contend  the  District  misclassified  Hurwitz  as  a  temporary  employee,  and  should 
have  classified  her  as  a  probationary  employee  as  of  February  1,  2008,  because  the  teacher 
she  was  hired  to  replace  (i.e.,  Laura  August)  resigned  from  the  District  on  January  31,  2008. 
Respondents  contend  Hurwitz,  as  a  probationary  employee,  would  affect  the  relative 
seniority  of  other  probationary  and  permanent  employees  and,  therefore,  any  Respondent 
with  more  seniority  than  Hurwitz  must  be  retained.  Respondents’  contention  cannot  be 
sustained. 

The  Education  Code  classifies  teachers  into  four  different  categories: 

permanent,  probationary,  substitute,  and  temporary.  A  temporary  teacher  is,  among  other 
definitions,  a  teacher  hired  by  the  district  for  a  semester  or  a  complete  school  year  to  replace 
a  regular  teacher  who  has  been  granted  leave  for  that  time  or  is  experiencing  long-term 
illness.  (Ed.  Code,  §44920.)  The  classification  of  "probationary"  is  the  default  classification 
and  applies  to  teachers  who  are  not  otherwise  required  by  the  Education  Code  to  be  classified 
as  permanent,  temporary,  or  substitute.  (Ed.  Code,  §  44915;  Bakersfield  Elementary 
Teachers  Assn.  v.  Bakersfield  City  School  Dist.  (2006)  145  Cal.App.4th  1260,  1280.)  The 
contention  that  status  as  a  temporary  teacher  is  only  allowed  when  a  teacher  replaces  a 
specific  employee  on  leave  (i.e.,  the  temporary  teacher  must  teach  the  classes  that  a 

 

particular  teacher  on  leave  would  have  taught)  was  rejected  in  Santa  Barbara  Federation  of 
Teachers  v.  Santa  Barbara  High  School  Dist.  (1977)  76  Cal.App.3d  223,  233.  In  Santa 
Barbara,  the  court  held  that  a  school  district  is  not  required  to  match  temporary  employees 
with  permanent  or  probationary  employees  on  a  one-to-one  basis.  Rather,  a  school  district 
only  needs  to  ensure  that  "the  number  of  temporary  teachers  not  exceed  the  total  number  of 
probationary  and  permanent  employees  on  leave  at  any  one  time."  (/d.,  76  Cal.App.3d  at 
232-233.) 

Thus,  contrary  to  Respondents'  contention,  the  District  was  not  precluded  from 

classifying  Hurwitz  as  a  temporary  employee  merely  because  of  Laura  August's  resignation 
from  the  District.  Moreover,  the  evidence  did  not  establish  that  Hurwitz's  classification  as  a 
temporary  employee  was,  in  fact,  erroneous.  No  evidence  was  presented  that  Hurwitz 
disputed  her  classification  as  a  temporary  employee  or  that  established  she  was  entitled  to 
classification  as  a  probationary  employee.  (See,  Ed.  Code  §§  44918  and  44920.) 

22. 

Respondents  Afarin  Kashanian  (#115)  and  Jill  Coley  (#110)  both  have  a 

seniority  date  of  August  24,  2005,  and  received  precautionary  notices.  As  it  is  determined 
that  the  District  has  properly  noticed  the  employees  corresponding  to  the  reduction  of  23.5 
FTE  positions,  it  is  not  necessary  to  address  in  this  decision  the  contentions  of  the  employees 
who  received  precautionary  notices. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

23. 

After  considering  all  evidence  and  argument,  it  is  found  that  no  permanent  or 

probationary  employee  with  less  seniority  than  Respondents  is  being  retained  to  render  a 
service  for  which  any  Respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

1. 

Jurisdiction  for  these  proceedings  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections 

44949  and  44955,  as  set  forth  in  Findings  1  through  13. 

2. 

Each  of  the  services  set  forth  in  Finding  3 

is  a  particular  kind  of  service  which 
may  be  reduced  or  discontinued  in  accordance  with  applicable  statutes  and  case  law.  Cause 
exists,  because  of  the  reduction  in  particular  kinds  of  services,  to  reduce  the  District's 
teaching  positions  by  23.5  FTE  and  to  give  notice  to  the  affected  teachers,  pursuant  to 
Education  Code  section  44955.  (Campbell  y.  Abbot  (1978)  76  Cal.App.3d  796;  Degener  v. 
Governing  Bd.  (1977)  67  Cal.App.3d  689.)  The  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the 
services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious  but  rather  a  proper  exercise  of  the  District's 
discretion,  as  set  forth  in  Findings  11-13. 

3. 

Notice  may  be  given  to  the  Respondents  listed  on  Exhibit  1  attached  hereto, 

corresponding  to  a  total  of  23.5  FTE  positions,  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the 
2008-2009  school  year.  (Findings  1-23.) 

   

  

4. 

Notice  may  not  be  given  to  the  following  Respondents  who  received  layoff 
notices  as  a  precaution:  Paige  Adams,  Jill  Coley,  Jennifer  Gilmour,  Jeffrey  Harris,  Afarin 
Kashanian,  Keith  Rust,  Richard  Tolfo,  Phillip  Wagner,  Heather  Woodring,  and  Dina  Yoseph. 
The  Accusation  shall  be  dismissed  as  to  these  Respondents.  (Findings  1-23.)
