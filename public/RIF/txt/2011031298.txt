General Findings Concerning Statutory Requirements

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Education Sections 44949 and 44955,3 provide for two notices to be given in
connection with terminating certificated employees. The first notice, which will be referred
to as the Preliminary Layoff Notice, is given by the superintendent. It is given to the
governing board and to the employees the superintendent recommends for layoff. The
Preliminary Layoff Notice gives the board and the employees notice that the superintendent
recommends that those employees be laid off. The superintendent must give the Preliminary
Layoff Notice no later than March 15. There is no requirement that a governing board take
any action in March. But while it is unnecessary, governing boards usually adopt a
resolution ratifying the superintendent’s recommendations.

2.

The second notice is a notice of a governing board’s decision to terminate an
employee. That notice is provided for in Section 44955 and must be given before May 15.
That notice advises a teacher that the district will not require his or her services for the
ensuing school year. That notice will be referred to as a Termination Notice.

3.

In this case, not later than March 15, 2010, the superintendent notified the

governing board and the respondents that he recommended that the respondents not be
retained for the ensuing school year. In this case, however, as to four respondents, there was
a defect in the service of the notice.

4.

The Preliminary Layoff Notice stated the reasons for the recommendation.

The recommendation was not related to respondents’ competency.

3 All references to the Code are to the Education Code unless otherwise specified.

2

5.

Except as to four of the respondents, a Preliminary Layoff Notice was

delivered to each respondent, either by personal delivery or by depositing the notice in the
United States mail, registered, postage prepaid, and addressed to respondent’s last known
address.

6.

The Preliminary Layoff Notice advised each respondent who was properly

served as follows: He or she had a right to a hearing. In order to obtain a hearing, he or she
had to deliver a request for a hearing in writing to the person sending the notice. The request
had to be delivered by a specified date, which was a date that was not less than seven days
after the notice was served.4 And the failure to request a hearing would constitute a waiver
of the right to a hearing.

7.

Respondents either timely filed written requests for a hearing or obtained a

waiver of their failure to file. An accusation was timely served on respondents. Respondents
were given notice that, if they were going to request a hearing, they were required to file a
notice of defense within five days after being served with the accusation.5 Respondents
either filed timely notices of defense or obtained a waiver of their failure to file. All
prehearing jurisdictional requirements were either met or waived.

8.

The governing board of the district resolved to reduce or discontinue particular
kinds of services. Within the meaning of Section 44955, the services are “particular kinds of
services” that can be reduced or discontinued. The decision to reduce or discontinue these
services was not arbitrary or capricious but constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

Defects in Service of Notices

9.

The district stipulated that, with respect to four respondents, there was a defect

in the service of the Preliminary Layoff Notice. Those respondents are Brian Martinez,
Maria Cecil Martinez-Guzman, Clynton H. Parsons, and Rachael Payan. The district further
stipulated that it would not give Termination Notices to these respondents.

4 Employees must be given at least seven days in which to file a request for a hearing.
Education Section 44949, subdivision (b), provides that the final date for filing a request for
a hearing “shall not be less than seven days after the date on which the notice is served upon
the employee.”

5 Pursuant to Government Section 11506, a party on whom an accusation is served

must file a notice of defense in order to obtain a hearing. Education Section 44949,
subdivision (c)(1), provides that, in teacher termination cases, the notice of defense must be
filed within five days after service of the accusation.

3

Services the District Intends to Reduce or Discontinue

10.

The governing board of the district determined that, because particular kinds

of services are to be reduced or discontinued, it is necessary to decrease the number of
permanent or probationary employees in the district by 272 full time equivalents (FTE).

11.

The particular kinds of services the governing board of the district resolved to

reduce or discontinue are:

USE OF TIE-BREAKING CRITERIA BASED ON THE CURRENT NEEDS OF THE DISTRICT AND STUDENTS

13.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (b), the governing board of the district

adopted criteria for determining the order of termination as among employees who first
rendered paid service on the same day. Section 44955, subdivision (b), requires a district to
adopt such criteria and provides that the criteria are to be based on “needs of the district and
the students . . . .” The district’s tie-breaking criteria are as follows:

[I]n the event of a certificated layoff the following criteria shall
be applied in order based on information on file as of February
1, [2011], one step at a time until the tie is broken, to resolve
ties in seniority between certificated employees:

Highly Qualified Status under NCLB in area of

1.
assignment.

Possession of an authorization to teach English Language

2.
Learners in order of priority:

Bilingual Cross Cultural Language and Academic

11.
District by February 1.

If ties cannot be broken by using the above criteria then

12.
order of seniority shall be determined by a random drawing
among employees in the individual tie.

14.

Application of the tie-breaking criteria resulted in determining the order of

termination solely on the basis of needs of the district and the students thereof.

DISTRICT’S INTENTION TO DEVIATE FROM SENIORITY (SKIPPING)

15.

Pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), the governing board of the
district resolved to deviate from terminating employees in the order of seniority, i.e., the
board resolved to skip over teachers with a particular qualification and lay off more senior
teachers who do not possess that qualification.

16.

The district identified the following course or course of study as one creating a
specific need for personnel: English Learner (EL). The district demonstrated a specific need
for personnel to teach EL students; demonstrated that certain teachers have special training
and experience necessary to teach that course or course of study; and demonstrated that other
teachers, in spite of being more senior, do not possess that special training and experience.

17.

The board resolved as follows:

WHEREAS, this Board has determined that due to a significant
population of English language learners with specialized
educational needs, a specific and compelling need exists to
employ and retain certificated employees who have formal (not
emergency) authorization to teach English Learner ("EL")
students, as determined by the California Commission on
Teacher Credentialing, and the special training and experience
that comes therewith; and

WHEREAS, State law mandates that each failure to staff a
classroom containing one or more EL students with a
certificated employee possessing an appropriate EL
authorization is "misassignment" subject to sanction by the
County Superintendent of Schools; and

WHEREAS, compliance with the provisions of the No Child
Left Behind Act ("NCI B"), the Williams Settlement, and
Education Section 44253.1 require that EL students be served
by certificated employees with appropriate EL authorizations;
and

WHEREAS, the needs of the District and the students thereof
should not and cannot be adequately served by concentrating EL
students in particular classrooms in such a manner as to lessen
the need for certificated employees with EL authorizations; and
WHEREAS, EL authorizations are not required for school
counselors, nurses, psychologists; and

7

WHEREAS, Education Section 44955(d) authorizes this Board to
deviate from terminating a certificated employee in order of
seniority for the above reasons, if necessary.

RIGHT TO BE RETAINED ACCORDING TO SENIORITY AND QUALIFICATIONS – DATE OF HIRE

18.

Job security is not inherent in seniority. The Legislature chose to provide

teachers with limited job security according to their seniority.

19.

Danielle Greene contends that she is more senior than the district lists her as

being. Ms. Greene began rendering paid service in October of 2007. She held an emergency
certificate. She continued to teach on that certificate until June 30, 2010, when the district
non-reelected her.

20.

In March of 2010, Ms. Greene obtained a preliminary credential. On July 30,

2010, which was one month after the district non-reelected Ms. Greene, the district rehired
her. On this occasion she was hired as an intern.

21. Ms. Greene contends that her date of hire is October of 2007. The district

contends that it is July 30, 2010.

Guy Krant

22.

Guy Krant is a high school art teacher. He began teaching at San Gorgonio

High School in September of 1998 and has continued to teach there.

23.

The federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), Title 22, United

States Section 6301 et seq. requires that English language learners be served by teachers who
have EL authorization. Also, the California Legislature, in Section 44253.1 et seq., required
the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to “implement an assessment system to certify
those teachers who have the essential skills and knowledge necessary to meet the needs of
California’s limited-English-proficient pupils.” The Commission on Teacher Credentialing
did that and made the system applicable to any teacher assigned to provide EL services to
one or more EL students. The system applies not only to core content classes but also to
elective subjects such as art and music.

24.

A school district that assigns a teacher who does not have EL authorization to

teach an EL student faces a risk of being sanctioned by the County Superintendent of
Schools and a risk of being found to be out of compliance with NCLB.

8

25.

By a letter dated July 16, 2009, the San Bernardino City Unified School

District advised all teachers who did not have EL authorization that their failure to obtain it
would put them at risk of being laid off. The letter stated, in part, the following:

Given that 34% of the District’s students are designated as
English Learners, it is the District’s expectation that all teachers
possess this authorization. This allows the District to meet state
credentialing requirements, as well as providing assignment
flexibility.

[¶ . . . ¶]

If you do not currently possess EL authorization, please be
informed that if the District moves toward layoffs in the future
(which, given the state budget crisis, seems likely), it will be the
administration’s recommendation to the Board of Education to
implement “skipping” criteria. This will mean that within any
identified type of service (i.e. elementary teachers, secondary
English, etc.), less senior staff members with EL authorization
will be skipped, leading to the potential layoff of more senior
staff members who do not possess EL authorization.

On the attached sheet you will find the current options that are
available to obtain EL authorization. Please indicate which
option you will pursue and return this form to Trina Brown in
Certificated Human Resources . . . . It is imperative that you
take the necessary steps to obtain appropriate EL authorization
as soon as possible.

If you have any questions or need more information, we are
hosting two (2) informational meetings. You are certainly
encouraged to attend: [The dates, times, and place are stated.]

26.

In the attachment, the district outlined two ways in which one could obtain EL

authorization. One could take an examination, or one could complete a course of study at a
college or university. The district listed the colleges and universities that offered the courses.
The district also offered to reimburse the cost of the examination.

27. Mr. Krant was one of the teachers to whom the district sent the July 16, 2009,

letter.

28. When Mr. Krant was in the second grade, he was diagnoses as being dyslexic.
It is difficult for him to remember things. It also is difficult for him to understand things and
respond quickly. He testified that he has never taken a test without accommodation, i.e.,
without being provided extra time, special instructions, or some other necessary

9

accommodation. He started and stopped college several times. After he obtained help
through the Disabled Student Center at California State University at Long Beach, he was
able to earn his degree. Mr. Krant testified that, without special accommodation, he never
would have been able to pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST).

29.

On September 9, 2009, Mr. Krnat began taking California Teacher of English
Learners (CTEL) classes in order to prepare to take the EL examinations. This was less than
two months after the district sent out the July 16, 2009, letter. The training program consists
of 15 classes. He completed eight classes in September, five in October, one in November,
and one in December of 2009.

30.

On November 18, 2009, while Mr. Krant was taking the classes, he applied to
register to take the three EL tests on June 12, 2010. As part of his application, he requested
special accommodation. CTEL responded and said Mr. Krant would need to submit a
completed Alternative Testing Arrangement Request Form no later than May 14, 2010. On
April 7, 2010, which was five weeks before the deadline for submitting the form, Mr. Krant
faxed the completed form along with a January 27, 1993, memorandum from the Adult
Learning Disabilities Program at California State University, Long Beach. The
memorandum said that, when taking tests, Mr. Krant might need accommodations such as
extended time, an alternative location away from distraction, and use of a thesaurus or
misspeller dictionary. By a letter dated April 23, 2010, CTEL advised Mr. Krant that, in
order to obtain alternative testing arrangements, he would have to submit the name, date, and
results of evaluations that had resulted in his being found to be disabled.

31. Mr. Krant set about to obtain that documentation. He contacted his health care

insurer and, on May 5, 2010, obtained a list of psychologists who might evaluate him and
provide the documentation. He left voice mail messages for 15 psychologists, but only one,
Charity Paxton-Hennings, Psy.D., returned his call. Mr. Krant saw Dr. Paxton-Hennings on
May 17, 2010; she told him that her schedule would not permit her to complete an evaluation
before the CTEL test date of June 12, 2010. Mr. Krant cancelled his appointment to take the
tests on that date. Dr. Paxton-Hennings tested Mr. Krant on June 7 and 15, 2010, and wrote
a report dated June 24, 2010. Thus, it was not Mr. Krant’s fault that he was unable to take
the tests on June 12, 2010.

32.

Dr. Paxton-Hennings also wrote a letter dated April 4, 2011, addressed to
“Whom it may concern.” She wrote that Mr. Krant has multiple learning disabilities that
constitute a handicapping condition for him. She wrote that he needs extra time to complete
tasks and that giving him additional time to obtain EL authorization would be a reasonable
accommodation. The letter is as follows:

I previously evaluated Mr. Guy Krant in June of 2010 and found
him to be a person with multiple learning disabilities in spite of
overall intelligence scores within the Gifted range. These
findings were consistent with other evaluations (beginning as
early as 2nd grade) which found him to be “dyslexic” and show

10

significant delays in “processing speed.” As an individual with
a handicapping condition, Mr. Krant is eligible for reasonable
accommodations within the workplace. These accommodations
may include, but are not limited to:

Extra time to complete tasks
Extended time for examinations/evaluations
Repetition of mandatory instructions in both

1)
2)
3)
auditory and visual formats

Mr. Krant was initially referred to me in order [for me] to
determine if he qualified for testing accommodations to
complete California state tests which are required for him to
maintain his teaching position. It is my professional opinion
that Mr. Krant will be granted accommodations for this test/s
given the severity of his disability. However, he was unable to
take them due to illness. Mr. Krant has re-registered for the
next administration of this examination.

It is a reasonable accommodation, given Mr. Krant’s disability,
to grant him additional time to meet this requirement.

33.

After obtaining Dr. Paxton-Hennings’s June 24, 2010, report, Mr. Krant

planned to take one of the three tests in December of 2010. He planned to take only one of
the tests because Dr. Paxton-Hennings had advised him that he should take one test at a time
– not all three in one administration.

34.

As it turned out, Mr. Krant was unable to take the test in December because of

an extended illness. He began feeling unwell in September of 2010. He continued to feel
unwell and in November was diagnosed with pharyngitis, sinusitis, and bronchitis. He
continued to be ill in December. On December 13, 2010, his doctor began a second series of
injections to combat infection. Other teachers may have been delayed in taking the tests
because of illnesses. It is not Mr. Krant’s illness that entitles him to accommodation. It is
his dyslexia. If it had not been for his dyslexia, he would have taken the tests on June 12,
2010.

35.

On January 30, 2011, Mr. Krant registered to take one of the CTEL

examinations on June 11, 2011. Again, he requested special accommodation. He has not yet
received a reply to that request.

36.

Thus, Mr. Krant did not procrastinate. After the district sent out the July 16,

2009, letter, he began taking the necessary classes. He made timely application for
accommodation. When the testing authority notified him that it required a particular type of
evidence of his disability, he promptly set about to obtain it. He has been diligent in his
effort to comply with the requirement that he obtain EL authorization.

11

37.

As noted above, High School Art Teaching Services are being reduced by two
FTEs. The superintendent skipped all teachers who have EL authorization. If Mr. Krant had
had EL authorization, the district would have skipped him, i.e., would not have served him
with a Preliminary Layoff Notice.

38. Mr. Krant contends that, because he has multiple learning disabilities, the

district should have given him additional time to obtain EL authorization. If the district had
done that, the superintendent, in order to achieve the reduction of two FTEs, would have
given a Preliminary Layoff Notice to a teacher who has greater seniority than Mr. Krant has,
i.e., a teacher whose date of hire was earlier than his.

39.

Two high school art teachers who are senior to Mr. Krant do not have EL

authorization.

40.

In the 2011-12 school year, the district will have approximately 50 teachers

who do not have EL authorization.

RIGHT TO BE RETAINED ACCORDING TO SENIORITY AND QUALIFICATIONS – BUMPING

41.

The second paragraph of section 44955, subdivision (c), does not add to

teachers’ seniority rights. It does, however, make it clear that governing boards must make
assignments in such a way as to protect seniority rights. Employees must be retained to
render any service their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render. Thus, if a senior
teacher whose regular assignment is being eliminated is certificated and competent to teach a
junior teacher’s courses, the district must retain the senior teacher and reassign him or her to
render that service. This is commonly referred to as bumping. The district must either
reassign or terminate the junior employee.

42.

Bridgett Gonzalez, whose date of hire is August 23, 2006, teaches one of the

services being reduced and is subject to layoff. Tina Lingenfelter, whose date of hire is
October 16, 2008, does not teach one of the services being reduced. Ms. Gonzalez, however,
is qualified to fill Ms. Lingenfelter’s position, i.e., Ms. Gonzalez has a right to bump into Ms.
Lingenfelter’s position. As of the present, however, Ms. Gonzalez has not advised the
district as to whether she chooses to do that.

43. Ms. Lingenfelter testified. She acknowledged that Ms. Gonzalez is qualified
to fill the position but testified that she, Ms. Lingenfelter, has some unique experience and
qualification that cause her to be better qualified. Ms. Lingenfelter’s qualification, however,
is not the issue; the focus of the inquiry is on Ms. Gonzalez’s qualification. If Ms. Gonzalez
is qualified to fill the position, that is the end of the matter. And she is qualified.

12

MANDATED SERVICES

44.

State and federal laws mandate that certain services be provided at or above
mandated levels. There was no evidence that the district is reducing those services below
mandated levels.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS REGARDING RETENTION OF EMPLOYEES

45. With regard to respondents who are permanent employees, the district is not

retaining any probationary employee to render a service that such a respondent is certificated
and competent to render.

46. With regard to respondents who are permanent employees, the district is not

retaining any employee with less seniority than such a respondent has to render a service that
the respondent is certificated and competent to render.6

47. With regard to respondents who are either permanent or probationary
employees, the district is not retaining any employee with less seniority than such a
respondent has to render a service that the respondent’s qualifications entitle him or her to
render.7

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

General Conclusions

1.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Sections 44949 and 44955. Except as

noted above, all notice and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were
satisfied.

2.

Within the terms of Sections 44949 and 44955, the district has cause to reduce

or discontinue particular kinds of services and to give Termination Notices to certain
respondents. The cause relates solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils.

Conclusions Regarding Ms. Greene

3.

By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 19 through 21, it is determined

that Ms. Greene’s date of hire is July 30, 2010.

6 Section 44955, subdivision (b), provides seniority protection for a permanent

employee in terms of the services the employee is “certificated and competent to render.”

7 Section 44955, subdivision (c), provides seniority protection for both permanent and

probationary employees in terms of the services an employee’s “qualifications entitle [him
or her] to render.”

4.

Summerfield v. Windsor Unified School District (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1026,

concerns a teacher who taught under an emergency permit for two years and under a
preliminary credential the following year. Before March 15 of the teacher’s third year, the
district sent her a notice of non-reelection. She contended that, as a result of being reelected
after serving two years under the emergency permit, she became a tenured teacher and that,
therefore, she no longer was subject to non-reelection. The court disagreed and held that
time spent teaching under an emergency permit cannot be counted toward accruing tenure as
a permanent employee.

5.

Thus, the district had a right to non-reelected Ms. Greene. When the district

rehired her one month later, that became her new date of hire. Because of the break in
service, her original date of hire no longer applies.

Conclusions Regarding Mr. Krant

6.

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act), (42 U.S.C. §
12101 et seq.), prohibits an employer from discriminating against an “individual with a
disability” who, with “reasonable accommodation,” can perform the essential functions of a
job. (42 U.S.C. § 12112, subds. (a) and (b)).

7.

An employer who fails to make “reasonable accommodations to the known

physical or mental limitations of an [employee] with a disability” discriminates “unless” the
employer “can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the
operation of [its] business.” (Italics added.) (42 U.S.C. § 12112, subd. (b)(5)(A)).

8.

The process to identify whether a reasonable accommodation must be made

for an employee begins with defining the “essential functions” of the employee’s job. “The
term ‘essential functions’ means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the
individual with a disability holds or desires.” (29 C.F.R. § 1630.2.) The law contemplates
an interactive and cooperative process to determine appropriate accommodations. To
determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation, it may be necessary for the covered
entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the employee who is in need of an
accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the
disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations.
(29 C.F.R. § 1630.2, subd. (o).)

9.

In US Airways, Inc., v. Barnett, (2002) 535 U.S. 391, the United States

Supreme Court held that, generally, a requested accommodation cannot be reasonable if it
conflicts with the rules of a seniority system.

This case, arising in the context of summary judgment, asks us
how the Act resolves a potential conflict between: (1) the
interests of a disabled worker who seeks assignment to a
particular position as a “reasonable accommodation,” and (2)
the interests of other workers with superior rights to bid for the

14

job under an employer’s seniority system. In such a case, does
the accommodation demand trump the seniority system?

In our view, the seniority system will prevail in the run of cases.
As we interpret the statute, to show that a requested
accommodation conflicts with the rules of a seniority system is
ordinarily to show that the accommodation is not “reasonable.”
Hence such a showing will entitle an employer/defendant to
summary judgment on the question—unless there is more. (US
Airways, supra, at pp. 393 – 394.)

10.

The Court concluded that, generally, such an accommodation would

necessarily be unreasonable because of the impact on other employees. The Court said:

Yet a demand for an effective accommodation could prove
unreasonable because of its impact, not on business operations,
but on fellow employees – say, because it will lead to
dismissals, relocations, or modification of employee benefits to
which an employer, looking at the matter from the perspective
of the business itself, may be relatively indifferent. (US
Airways, supra, at pp. 400 – 401.)

11.

The Court emphasized the importance of not undermining employees’
expectations of uniform treatment with regard to a seniority system. The Court said:

Most important for present purposes, to require the typical
employer to show more than the existence of a seniority system
might well undermine the employees’ expectations of
consistent, uniform treatment – expectations upon which the
seniority system’s benefits depend. That is because such a rule
would substitute a complex case-specific “accommodation”
decision made by management for the more uniform,
impersonal operation of seniority rules. Such management
decisionmaking, with its inevitable discretionary elements,
would involve a matter of the greatest importance to employees,
namely, layoffs . . . . (US Airways, supra, at pp. 404 – 405.)

12.

But in a case in which other employees can not have a legitimate expectation

that a seniority rule will be followed, an accommodation may be reasonable in spite of the
fact that it conflicts with the rules of a seniority system. The Court said:

The plaintiff (here the employee) nonetheless remains free to
show that special circumstances warrant a finding that, despite
the presence of a seniority system (which the ADA may not
trump in the run of cases), the requested “accommodation” is

15

“reasonable” on the particular facts. That is because special
circumstances might alter the important expectations described
above. (US Airways, supra, at p. 405.)

[¶ . . . ¶]

[A] showing that [a proposed accommodation] would violate the
rules of a seniority system warrants summary judgment for the
employer – unless there is more. The plaintiff must present
evidence of that “more,” namely, special circumstances
surrounding the particular case that demonstrate the
[accommodation] is nonetheless reasonable. (US Airways,
supra, at p. 406.)

13.

It is determined that the present case is one in which special circumstances

warrant a finding that, despite the presence of a seniority system, the requested
accommodation is reasonable. In the present case, special circumstances altered the
expectations the senior teachers legitimately could have. The district sent the July 16, 2009,
letter to all teachers. Thus, the two teachers who are senior to Mr. Krant knew that the
district expected them to obtain EL authorization. The letter advised them that their failure
to obtain EL authorization would put them at risk of being laid off. As noted above, the
letter stated, in part, the following:

If you do not currently possess EL authorization, please be
informed that if the District moves toward layoffs in the future
(which, given the state budget crisis, seems likely), it will be the
administration’s recommendation to the Board of Education to
implement “skipping” criteria. This will mean that within any
identified type of service (i.e. elementary teachers, secondary
English, etc.), less senior staff members with EL authorization
will be skipped, leading to the potential layoff of more senior
staff members who do not possess EL authorization. [¶ . . . ¶] It
is imperative that you take the necessary steps to obtain
appropriate EL authorization as soon as possible.

14.

The superintendent should not have given a Preliminary Layoff Notice to Mr.

Krant. Rather, the superintendent should have given the notice to one of the two senior
teachers who, also, have not obtained EL authorization.8 Mr. Krant has been diligent in his

8 Phrasing the matter in this way is instructive. It, however, suggests that the

superintendent was presented with this issue at the time he sent out Preliminary Layoff
Notices. In fact, the superintendent did not know that Mr. Krant needed accommodation.
The superintendent did not know that Mr. Krant is dyslexic. Mr. Krant prefers that people
not know. Thus, at the time the superintendent sent out Preliminary Layoff Notices he did
not know there was reason to consider sending a notice to one of the two more senior art

16

effort to comply with the requirement that he obtain EL authorization. If it had not been for
his dyslexia, he would have had the authorization. Because of his dyslexia, he needs
additional time to obtain it.

15.

In the terms of US Airways, supra, 535 U.S. 391, there are special

circumstances here that alter the expectations the two more senior art teachers legitimately
could have. Thus, in spite of the fact that the accommodation Mr. Krant seeks is in conflict
with a seniority rule, it is a reasonable accommodation.

16.

Here the seniority system is established by state law, not merely by contract.

Under the doctrine of federal preemption, however, the reasonable accommodation
requirement of the ADA must prevail over the state law.

17.

That leaves a final matter. As noted above, an employer is not required to

provide a reasonable accommodation if the employer can demonstrate that the
accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business. Would
giving Mr. Krant additional time impose an undue hardship on the district? It is determined
that it would not. It is true that giving Mr. Krant more time will impose a hardship. The
district may have to create classes with no EL students in them or risk being in violation of
NCLB and facing sanctions. The district may have to advise parents that Mr. Krant, who
does not have EL authorization, is teaching their EL children. But it is not as though the
district would not face those hardships if it were not for Mr. Krant. As noted above, the
district, in the 2011-12 school year, will have approximately 50 teachers who do not have EL
authorization. Thus, accommodating Mr. Krant will not create a hardship. Rather it merely
will increase the hardship by two percent. Viewed in the light of the important policies
underlying the ADA, that is not an undue hardship.

18.

It is determined that the district must make a reasonable accommodation in an
attempt to enable Mr. Krant to maintain his position as an art teacher. Mr. Krant has multiple
learning disabilities. They constitute an impairment that substantially limits one or more of
his major life activities. He requires much more time than most people require to complete
tasks involving memory, assimilating information, and responding to information. He has a
long record of this impairment. In spite of this impairment, he can perform the essential
functions of a high school art teacher. He is prepared to engage in an interactive and
cooperative process with the district to determine appropriate accommodations; he recently
sent the district’s human resources department a package of materials describing his
impairment and outlining the efforts he has made to obtain EL authorization.

teachers. Nevertheless, as a precaution, the superintendent served a Precautionary
Preliminary Layoff Notice on each of the two senior art teachers. Thus, in spite of not
having known of Mr. Krant’s need for accommodation, the district could have terminated
one of the senior teachers. At the hearing, however, the district elected to rescind those
precautionary notices. Unfortunately, this set of circumstances may result in the district’s
being able to reduce its staff by only 271 FTEs rather than by 272 FTEs.

Conclusions Regarding Ms. Gonzalez and Ms. Lingenfelter

19.

By reason of the matters set forth in Findings 41 through 43, it is determined
that the district may give a Termination Notice to either Ms. Gonzalez or Ms. Lingenfelter
but not to both of them. If Ms. Gonzalez chooses to bump into Ms. Lingenfelter’s position,
the district may give a Termination Notice to Ms. Lingenfelter. If Ms. Gonzalez does not
choose to bump into Ms. Lingenfelter’s position, the district may give a Termination Notice
to Ms. Gonzalez.

Cause Exists to Terminate Certain Respondents

20.

Cause does not exist to terminate the following: The respondents identified in

Findings 9 and 12, Mr. Krant, and either Ms. Gonzalez or Ms. Lingenfelter.

services will not be required for the ensuing school year.

9 In the present proceeding, there is no jurisdiction to deal with matters other than
teacher lay off issues. It is appropriate to note, however, that under the ADA, the district and
Mr. Krant have an obligation to engage in an interactive and cooperative process to
determine what accommodations should be provided.
