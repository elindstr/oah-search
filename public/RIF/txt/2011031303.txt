The District initially identified 18 certificated employees as respondents. One of

these individuals (Sandra Otero) did not request a hearing, and two others (Marla Niffen and
Erin Richards) were dismissed as respondents during the course of the hearing. By the end
of the hearing the number of respondents had thus been reduced to the 15 individuals
identified in Appendix A. The term “respondents” as hereafter used in this Proposed
Decision refers collectively to these 15 remaining individuals.

3.

On March 11, 2011, in accordance with Education Code sections 44949 and

44955, the superintendent notified the Board of Education of the Nuview Union School
District in writing of his recommendation to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of
services for the upcoming school year. The superintendent stated the reasons for the
recommendation.

4.

On March 10, 2011, the board adopted Resolution No. 030011B, determining
that it would be necessary to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services at the end of
the current school year. The board determined that the particular kinds of services that must
be reduced for the 2011-2012 school year were the following full time equivalent (FTE)
positions:

Particular Kind of Service

Full-Time Equivalent

Elementary K-5 Teaching Services
Teacher on Special Assignment – Literacy Coach
Teacher on Special Assignment – Language Coach
Coordinator of Child Development Programs
Director of Child Development Programs
Elementary Physical Education Teaching Services

12

The proposed reductions totaled 17.6 FTE positions.

5.

The board further determined in Resolution 030011B that “competency,” as
described in Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), for the purposes of bumping,
“shall necessarily include: (1) possession of a valid credential in the relevant subject matter
area; (2) “highly qualified” status under the No Child Left Behind Act in the area to be
assigned; and (3) an appropriate EL authorization (if required by the position).”

6.

The board directed the superintendent or his designee to determine which

employees’ services would not be required for the 2011-2012 school year as a result of the
reduction of the foregoing particular kinds of services. The board further directed the
superintendent or his designee to send appropriate notices to all certificated employees of the
district who would be laid off as a result of the reduction of these particular kinds of services.

7.

On or before March 15, 2011, the district timely served on respondents a
written notice that the superintendent had recommended that their services would not be
required for the upcoming school year, along with the related accusation. The notice set
forth the reasons for the recommendation. The notice advised respondents of their right to a
hearing, that each respondent had to deliver a request for a hearing in writing to the person
sending the notice by the date specified in the notice, a date which in each case was more
than seven days after the notice was served, and that the failure to request a hearing would
constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing.

8.

Respondents timely filed written requests for hearing and notices of defense.

All pre-hearing jurisdictional requirements were met.

2

9.

Respondents are probationary or permanent certificated employees of the

district.

10.

The services the board addressed in Resolution 031011B were “particular

kinds of services” that could be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education
Code section 44955. The board’s decision to reduce or discontinue these particular kinds of
services was not arbitrary or capricious and constituted a proper exercise of discretion.

11.

The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related to the
welfare of the district and its pupils. The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of
services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees of the district as
determined by the board.

12.

The board was not aware of any attrition occurring prior to the date of the

hearing. If any attrition occurs after the hearing, the district intends to take such attrition into
account in determining the need to lay off its certificated employees.

13.

The district’s shortfall for the 2011-2012 academic year is presently estimated

at about $1,000,000. The savings expected to be achieved through the present layoff
proceeding is between $750,000 and $1,000,000. The district’s general fund operating
budget for next year is about $8,000,000. The district intends to meet the statutory minimum
three percent reserve fund. The district has not yet decided it if will maintain a reserve fund
in an amount greater than the required three percent. The district’s decisions and plans as
reflected in this finding are neither arbitrary nor capricious, but instead constitute a
reasonable exercise of the district’s discretion.

14.

No certificated employee junior to any respondent was retained to perform any

services which any respondent was certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 and

44955. All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied.

A district may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not,
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.)

3.

School districts have broad discretion in defining positions within the district

and establishing requirements for employment. This discretion encompasses determining the
training and experience necessary for particular positions. Similarly, school districts have
the discretion to determine particular kinds of services that will be eliminated, even though a

3

service continues to be performed or provided in a different manner by the district.
(Hildebrandt v. St. Helena Unified School Dist. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 334, 343.)
School districts retain discretion to determine standards of competency for purposes of
teacher layoffs, and those standards will be upheld as long as they are reasonable. (Duax v.
Kern Community College District (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 555, 565.)2

4.

The decision to reduce or discontinue a particular kind of service is not tied in

with any statistical computation. It is within the governing authority’s discretion to
determine the amount by which a particular kind of service will be reduced or discontinued
as long as the district does not reduce a service below the level required by law. (San Jose
Teachers Assn. v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 635-636.) A school district has wide
discretion in setting its budget and a layoff decision will be upheld unless it was fraudulent or
so palpably unreasonable and arbitrary as to indicate an abuse of discretion as a matter of
law. (California Sch. Employees Assn. v. Pasadena Unified Sch. Dist. (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d
318, 322.)

5.

Pursuant to section 44995, a senior teacher whose position is discontinued has
the right to transfer to a continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to
fill. In doing so, the senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is
filling that position. (Lacy v. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469.)
Stated differently, the district has an obligation under section 44955 to determine whether
any permanent employee whose employment is to be terminated in an economic layoff
possesses the seniority and qualifications which would entitle him/her to be assigned to
another position. (Bledsoe v. Biggs Unified School Dist., supra. at 136-137.)

6.

A preponderance of the evidence sustained the charges set forth in the

accusation. Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the district to
reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services. The cause for the reduction or
discontinuation of particular kinds of services related solely to the welfare of the schools and
the pupils thereof. Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees of the district
due to the reduction and discontinuation of particular kinds of services. The district
identified the certificated employees providing the particular kinds of services that the Board
be directed be reduced or discontinued. It is recommended that the board give respondents
notice before May 23, 2011, that their services are no longer required by the district.

ADVISORY DETERMINATION

The following advisory determination is made:

2

Duax involved the layoff of community college teachers pursuant to Education Code

section 97743, but is applicable here by analogy.

4

1.

The accusations served on respondents are sustained. Notice may be given to

respondents before May 23, 2011, that their services will not be required because of the
reduction or discontinuation of particular services as indicated.
