PROPOSED  DECISION 

Administrative  Law  Judge  Melissa  G.  Crowell,  State  of  California,  Office  of 
Administrative  Hearings,  heard  this  matter  in  San  Francisco,  California,  on  April  8  and  9, 
2008. 

Namita  S.  Brown,  Attorney  at  Law,  Lozano  Smith,  represented  the  San  Francisco 

Unified  School  District. 

Stewart  Weinberg,  Attorney  at  Law,  Weinberg,  Roger  &  Rosenfeld,  represented  the 

respondents  who  are  members  of  the  United  Educators  of  San  Francisco.

The  record  was  left  open  for  submission  of  an  updated  list  of  respondents.  An 

updated  list  was  filed  on  April  11,  2008,  but  that  list  was  challenged  by  respondents.  An

record  was  closed  and  the  matter  submitted  for  decision  on  April  28,  2008. 

FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

On  February  26,  2008,  the  governing  board  of  the  San  Francisco  Unified 

School  District  adopted  Resolution  82-26503,  in  which  it  resolved  to  reduce  or  discontinue 
the  following  particular  kinds  of  services  for  the  2008-2009  school  year,  and  directed  the 
superintendent,  or  his  designee,  to  give  notice  to  certificated  employees  that  their  services 

would  be  terminated  at  the  end  of  the  2007-2008  school  year:  

  

Administrative  Services 
Elementary  Schools  Program  (K-8) 
Middle  School  Program 
High  School  Services 
Total  Full-Time  Equivalent  Reduction 

140  FTE 
173  FTE 
124  FTE 
98  FTE 
535  FTE 

2. 

On  March  10,  2008,  Chief  Administrative  Officer  Deborah  D.  Hirsh  sent 

notice  to  704  certificated  employees  that  it  had  been  recommended  that  notice  be  given  to 
them  that  their  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  Respondents 
filed  timely  requests  for  hearing  and  notices  of  defense.  Accusations  were  served  on  696 
certificated  employees.  All  procedural  requirements  of  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 
44955  have  been  met. 

3. 

Prior  to  hearing,  the  district  rescinded  accusations  against  7.8  FTE  positions 

by  reason  of  allocated  funding  from  the  Public  Education  Enrichment  Fund  (Proposition  H). 
The  parties  stipulate  that  as  a  result  of  this  funding,  the  total  number  of  full-time  equivalent 
positions  to  be  reduced  or  eliminated  is  527.2.  FTE. 

4. 

On  the  first  day  of  hearing,  the  district  rescinded  accusations  against  141  FTE 
positions.  This  number  took  into  account,  among  other  things,  attrition,  that  is,  the  number 
of  positions  held  by  certificated  employees  that  have  notified  the  district  that  they  will  retire 
or  resign  at  the  end  of  the  current  school  year. 

5. 

The  parties,  through  their  counsel,  stipulated  as  follows: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

All  certificated  employees  that  are  core  substitutes  will  be  classified  as 
probationary  employees  for  purposes  of  seniority. 

All  certificated  employees  that  are  site  support  substitutes  will  be 
classified  as  probationary  employees  for  purposes  of  seniority. 

The  seniority  dates  for  certificated  employees  who  participated  in  the 
Dream  Schools’  Professional  Development  Institute  in  June  of  2005  will 
be  advanced  to  reflect  the  first  day  of  their  mandatory  training.  As a 
result  of  this  change  in  seniority  dates,  the  district  rescinded  accusations 
filed  against  certificated  employees  holding  46  FTE  positions. 

The  district  will  credit  four  employees,  Robin  Mantius,  Justin  Stoddard, 
John  Hutchinson,  and  Patricia  Kay  Copeland,  with  one  additional  year  of 
service  upon  verification  of  their  first  date  of  paid  service  in  2006. 

e. 

The  district  withdrew  the  accusation  against  Malart  Cunningham.

The  district  withdrew  the  accusation  against  Christine  Palm.  She  is  a 
Child  Development  Center  teacher  and  she  should  not  have  received  a 
notice  in  this  layoff  proceeding. 

The  accusation  against  Rena  Frantz  is  withdrawn. 

Darius  Daniels  is  misclassified  as  a  temporary  employee.  He  is  a  first 
year  probationary  teacher. 

Andrea  Calderon  is  misclassified  as  a  probationary  teacher.  She  is  a 
permanent  employee  of  the  district. 

6. 

As  a  result  of  the  withdrawals  of  accusations  before  and  during  the  hearing, 
there  remain  355  respondents  in  this  proceeding.  The  list  of  remaining  respondents  in  this 
proceeding  is  set  forth  in  Attachment  A. 

Tie-Breaking  Criteria 

7. 

On  February  26,  2008,  the  governing  board  adopted  Resolution  No.  82-26503, 

which  established  tie-breaking  criteria  to  be  used  to  determine  the  order  of  termination  of 
employees  having  the  same  seniority  date.  In  the  tie-breaking  process,  employees  earn  one 
point  for  each  of  the  following  credentials  or  authorizations: 

@ 

Bilingual  Cross  Cultural  Language  and  Academic  Development 
(BCLAD)  Certification  or  Emergency  BCLAD. 

Special  Education  Credential. 

Single  Subject  Math  Credential. 

Single  Subject  Science  Credential. 

Single  Subject  Library/Media  Services  Credential. 

Single  Subject  Physical  Education  Credential. 

Pupil  Personnel  Services  —  School  Counseling,  or  School  Social  Worker. 

Cross  Cultural  Language  and  Academic  Development  (CLAD) 
Certification  or  Emergency  CLAD,  or  current  (as  of  1/31/08)  enrollment 
in  CLAD  certificate  program. 

e 

The  board  resolved  that  any  ties  that  existed  after  application  of  the  criteria  were  to  be 
resolved  by  lottery. 

3- 

 

  

8. 

Respondents  contend  that  the  district  erred  in  applying  the  tie-breaking  criteria 

for  those  employees  who  hold  a  BCLAD  certificate.  They  argue  that  a  BCLAD  certificate 
holder  should  earn  two  points,  not  one  point,  because  a  BCLAD  holder  is  authorized  to  do 
everything  that  a  CLAD  holder  is  authorized  to  do  but  is  also  able  to  do  so  in  a  bilingual 
setting.  The  board’s  criteria  are  not  ambiguous:  a  BCLAD  holder  is  entitled  to  one  point. 
In  essence,  respondents  are  challenging  the  wisdom  of  the  board’s  decision  to  give  the  same 
credit  toa  CLAD  holder  as  to  a  BCLAD  holder.  The  board  is  vested  with  the  discretion  to 
develop  tie-breaking  criteria  based  on  the  needs  of  the  district  and  its  students.  (Ed.  Code, 
§  44955,  subd.  (b).)  The  district  did  not  err  in  its  application  of  the  tie-breaking  criteria  to 
respondents. 

Noreen  Abulencia 

9. 

* 

Respondent  Noreen  Abulencia  is  a  second  year  probationary  certificated 

employee  with  a  seniority  date  of  August  23,  2006. 

Prior  to  working  in  the  K-12  program,  Abulencia  was a  tenured  teacher  in  the  Child 
Development  Program.  She  transferred  to  the  K-12  program,  at  the  request  of  the  district, 
and,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  in  the  union  contract,  she  received  a  bonus  for  doing 
so.  She  argues  that  her  seniority  date  should  be  her  first  date  of  paid  service  in  the  Child 
Development  Program,  which  was  in  1992,  and  not  her  first  date  of  paid  service  in  the  K-12 
program. 

Abulencia  was  correctly  given  a  seniority  date  of  her  first  day  of  paid  service  in  the 

K-12  program.  The  incentives  in  the  union  contract  are  to  encourage  certificated  teachers  to 
transfer  from  the  Child  Development  Center  to  the  K-12  program.  These  incentives  have  no 
bearing  on  the  teacher’s  seniority,  which  is  solely  governed  by  the  Education  Code.  There  is 
no  provision  in  the  Education  Code  which  would  authorize  respondent  to  add  (“tack”)  her 
years of  service  in  the  Child  Development  Program. 

10. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  to  respondents  is  being  retained  by  the  district 

to  perform  services  that  a  respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

11. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  is  related  to  the 

welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  for  this  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections 

44949  and  44955,  and  all  notices  and  other  requirements  of  these  sections  have  been 
provided  as  required  by  law. 

 

2. 

Cause  for  elimination  of  527.2  FTE  positions  exists  in  accordance  with 

Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955.  Cause  exists  to  give  notice  to  respondents  listed 
in  Attachment A  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  This 
cause  solely  relates  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  their  pupils  within  the  meaning  of 
Education  Code  section  44949. 

ORDER 

In  accordance  with  the  final  seniority  list,  notice  may  be  given  to  the  respondents 

listed  in  Attachment  A  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school year 
because  of  the  reduction of particular  kinds  of  services.
