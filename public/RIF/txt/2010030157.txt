Before issuing the preliminary layoff notices, the district took into account all 

positively assured attrition.  Additional attrition which became known before the hearing 
enabled the district to rescind many of the notices.  As of the time of the hearing, the district 
was planning to lay off 171 certificated employees in 152.30 full-time equivalent positions.  
The district must issue the final layoff notices before May 15, and when it does so the district 
will take into account any additional attrition that has occurred. 

Pursuant to the board’s resolution, the district intends to retain regardless of 
seniority (i.e., “skip” in the layoff process) certificated employees who possess a BCLAD2 
certificate and bilingual school psychologists.  All employees with a BCLAD certificate will 
be assigned next year to positions requiring such certification. 

Under Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), “the services of no 

permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions of this section while any 
probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to render a 
service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.”  (Italics 
added.)  To comply with this provision in determining which employees will be laid off in a 
particular subject area, the district has given preference to permanent employees over 
probationary employees, even when a probationary employee has an earlier seniority date 
than a permanent employee.  Except in this unusual circumstance, no certificated employee

any respondent is certificated and competent to render.

welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof within the meaning of Education Code section
