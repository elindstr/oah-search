BEFORE THE
GOVERNING BOARD
LOST HILLS UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT
COUNTY OF KERN
STATE OF CALIFORNIA

In the Matter of the Layoffs Of:

Sabrina Reimert and Laura E. Wanke,

Case No. 2012030510

Respondents.

PROPOSED DECISION

Samuel D. Reyes, Administrative Law Judge, Office of Administrative Hearings, heard

this matter on April 25, 2012, in Bakersfield, California.

Peter Carton, Attorney at Law, represented Jerry Scott (Scott), Superintendent of the

Lost Hills Union School District (District).

Paul A. Welchans, Attorney at Law,

represented Respondents Sabrina Reimert

(Reimert) and Laura Wanke (Wanke), collectively referred to as Respondents.

The District has decided to reduce or discontinue certain educational services and has
given Respondents and other certificated employees of the District notice of its intent not to
reemploy them for the 2012-2013 school year. Respondents requested a hearing for a
determination of whether cause exists for not reemploying them for the 2012-2013 school year.

Oral and documentary evidence, and evidence by oral stipulation on the record, was

received at the hearing, and the matter was submitted for decision.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

2.

Superintendent Scott filed the Accusation in his official capacity.

Respondents are certificated employees of the District.

3.

On February 7, 2012, the Governing Board of the District (Governing Board)
adopted Resolution number 2012-02-07A, reducing self-contained classroom instruction by
three full-time-equivalent (FTE) positions and special education services by one FTE for the
2012-2013 school year.

4.

On February 24, 2012, the District provided notice to Respondents that their
services will not be required for the 2012-2013 school year due to the reduction of particular
kinds of services.

5.

On February 29, 2012, Respondents requested a hearing to determine whether

there is cause for not reemploying them for the 2012-2013 school year.

6.

On March 26, 2012, the District issued the Accusation, the Notice of Hearing,
and other required documents, and served them on Respondents. Respondents thereafter filed
timely Notices of Defense.

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.

7.

8.

The services set forth in factual finding number 3 are particular kinds of services

which may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code1 section 44955.

9.

The Governing Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue the particular kinds of
services is neither arbitrary nor capricious but is rather a proper exercise of the District's
discretion.

10.

The reduction or discontinuance of services set forth in factual finding number 3
is related to the welfare of the District and its pupils, and it has become necessary to decrease
the number of certificated employees as determined by the Governing Board.

11.

On February 7, 2012, the Governing Board adopted Resolution number 2012-
02-07, setting forth the criteria to determine seniority among employees who first rendered paid
service in a probationary position on the same date (tie-breaking criteria). The specific criteria
were listed, not necessarily in order of importance as: credentialing; experience, extracurricular
activities, training, special education needs, competence, and evaluations. The District did not
find it necessary to utilize the tie-breaking criteria in implementation of the reductions in force
authorized by the Governing Board.

12.

Respondent Wanke has a seniority date of August 4, 2009, and is a permanent
employee of the District. She holds a clear multiple subject credential, and teaches fourth
grade.

a.

13.

Respondent Wanke, through counsel, asserts that the District retained a
certificated employee, Alejandro Esquivel (Esquivel), who, by virtue of his employment in a
categorical program, is not a permanent employee of the District or, alternatively, is not more
senior than Wanke.

1 All further statutory references are to the Education Code.

2

b.

The District first employed Esquivel for the 2003-2004 school year,
pursuant to a contract, which stated that “This employment is created pursuant to Education
Code Section 44909. Services to the District in the program for which you have been employed
is [sic] temporary and subject to the availability of categorical funds for the funding of your
position. . . .” (Exhibit C, at p. 1.) At the end of the school year, Esquivel received a
“Confirmation of Cessation of Temporary Employment Status,” terminating his employment.

c.

The District rehired Esquivel for the 2004-2005 school year, but he was
not offered a contract of employment. His employment was again terminated at the end of the
school year, pursuant to another “Confirmation of Cessation of Temporary Employment Status”
notice.

d.

Esquivel was rehired for the 2005-2006 school year. He was not offered
a written contract of employment. Esquivel has continued to work for the District since then,
and he did not receive a termination or nonreelection notice at the end of any school year after
the 2004-2005 school year. Although the District argued in its brief that Esquivel separated
from employment at the end of the 2005-2006 school year, no evidence was presented to
establish such fact, and, as set forth below, District records show that he has been employed
since 2004.

e.

The District’s business office generated a “Salary Placement Schedule”
form for each year Esquivel has been employed. The form was used to obtain approval for
payment of Esquivel’s salary, and, in addition to other salary and benefit information, the form
lists his purported “years of service.” For the 2004-2005, 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008,
and 2008-2009 school years, the years of service were listed as “0.” Years of service were
listed as “1” in the 2010-2011 school year Salary Placement Schedule form, and as “2” in the
current school year. The seniority list prepared just before layoff notices were issued, dated
February 27, 2012, lists Esquivel as having a “categorical” status employment contract.

f.

Esquivel worked pursuant to a preliminary multiple subject credential
until he obtained a clear multiple subject credential on August 28, 2008. During his entire
tenure, Esquivel has worked in categorically funded programs intended to help the children of
migrant farmworkers. The program in question will continue in effect for the 2012-2013 school
year.

g.

Jackie Villa (Villa), administrative assistant to Superintendent Scott,
testified that Esquivel was deemed to be a permanent employee upon the realization that the
District had failed to offer him a written contract of employment for the school years after
2004-2005. He has been assigned a seniority date of August 8, 2006.

3

14.

Respondent Reimert has a seniority date of August 29, 2011, and holds a
preliminary multiple subject credential. She teaches Fourth Grade. She is the most junior
elementary school teacher laid off.

15.

No certificated employee junior to Respondents Reimert and Wanke was

retained to render a service which either Respondent is certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

Jurisdiction for the subject proceeding exists pursuant

to Education Code

sections 44949 and 44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 7.

The services listed in factual finding number 3 are particular kinds of services

within the meaning of section 44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 3 and 8.

3.

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the District to
reduce or discontinue the particular kinds of services set forth in factual finding number 3,
which cause relates solely to the welfare of the District's schools and pupils, by reason of
factual finding numbers 1 through 10.

4.

The District has classified Esquivel as a permanent employee and has assigned
him a seniority date of August 8, 2006. The District maintains that its failure to provide
Esquivel with a temporary contract upon his rehire in 2006 rendered him a tenure-track
probationary employee, who by operation of law became permanent at the start of the 2008-
2009 school year. Respondent Wanke asserts that Esquivel is junior to her by virtue of his
employment
is a
permanent employee he shares the same seniority date with Respondent Wanke and the District
should have applied its tie-breaking criteria to retain the most senior employee.

in a categorical program. Alternatively, she argues, even if Esquivel

Initially, the District asserts that it is not required to staff categorically-funded programs
with employees hired pursuant to section 44909, a permissive statute, and that it did not hire
Esquivel pursuant to this statute. In pertinent part, section 44909 provides: “The governing
board of any school district may employ persons possessing an appropriate credential as
certificated employees in programs and projects to perform services conducted under contract
with public or private agencies, or categorically funded projects which are not required by
federal or state statutes. The terms and conditions under which such persons are employed shall
be mutually agreed upon by the employee and the governing board and such agreement shall
be reduced to writing. Service pursuant to this section shall not be included in computing the
service required as a prerequisite to attainment of, or eligibility to, classification as a permanent
employee unless (1) such person has served pursuant to this section for at least 75 percent of the
number of days the regular schools of the district by which he is employed are maintained and
(2) such person is subsequently employed as a probationary employee in a position requiring

4

certification qualifications. Such persons may be employed for periods which are less than a full
school year and may be terminated at the expiration of the contract or specially funded project
without regard to other requirements of this code respecting the termination of probationary or
permanent employees other than Section 44918. [¶ ] Whenever any certificated employee in
the regular educational program is assigned to a categorically funded project not required by
federal or state statute and the district employs an additional credentialed person to replace that
certificated employee, the replacement certificated employee shall be subject to the provisions
of Section 44918.” (Emphasis added.)

As the plain language of section 44909 makes clear, and as the District correctly points
out, the statute does not require, but, rather, permits, a district to hire temporary employees to
staff its categorical programs. Moreover, as the highlighted sentence requires, the employee
must indicate his/her assent in writing. Here, there is no credible evidence that Esquivel was
hired pursuant to this statute. His designation on an earlier seniority list as “categorical” is
insufficient to establish his employment status. The list is a secondary source of information
and is only correct to the extent that the information used to create the list is correct. As Villa
testified, Esquivel’s designation as a categorical employee on the seniority list was in error. Nor
is a designation on the salary placement financial forms controlling. Neither type of document
shows the parties’ mutual intent that Esquivel’s employment would be pursuant to section
44909. Accordingly, Esquivel was not hired pursuant to section 44909, and, therefore, any
limitation contained in the statute to his attainment of permanent status is not applicable to him.

5.

The Education Code permits certificated employees to be classified in one of
four ways: permanent, probationary, substitute, or temporary. (Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma
County Union High School District (2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 916 (Kavanaugh).) A certificated
employee is classified as permanent, i.e., acquires tenure, if, after having been employed for
two complete successive school years in a position requiring certification qualifications, he or
she is reelected for the following year. (§ 44929.21, subd. (b); Bakersfield Elementary Teachers
Association v. Bakersfield City School District (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1278-1279
(Bakersfield).) Probationary employees are “those persons employed in positions requiring
certification qualifications for the school year, who have not been classified as permanent
employees or as substitute employees.” (§ 44915.) “[S]ection 44915 has been understood to
make probationary status the default classification for certificated employees who are not
otherwise required by the Code to be classified as permanent, substitute, or temporary
employees. [Citations].” (Bakersfield, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at p. 1281.) Substitutes are
“those persons employed in positions requiring certification qualifications, to fill positions of
regularly employed persons absent from service. . . .” (§ 44917.) Temporary employees are
those requiring certification qualifications, other than substitute employees, who are employed
for limited assignments, as defined in the Code, such as in sections 44918, 44919, 44920, and
44921. (California Teachers Association v. Vallejo City Unified School District (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th 135, 146 (Vallejo).)

The seniority date of a certificated employee is defined as the date the employee “first
If a certificated employee is
rendered paid service in a probationary capacity.” (§ 44845.)
misclassified as a temporary teacher, or if the date on which the employee first rendered paid
service in a probationary capacity is otherwise incorrect, the employee’s seniority date may
need to be adjusted to reflect the earlier first date of probationary service. (Bakersfield, supra,
145 Cal.App.4th at p. 1273.)

In Kavanaugh, supra, the Supreme Court held that an employee who was not given
written notice on her first day of paid service for the district that her employment was as a
temporary employee, as required by section 44916, became a probationary employee by
operation of law. Similarly, the District’s failure to tender a contract to Esquivel designating a
status other than probationary employment resulted in his hiring by the default classification of
probationary employee.

6.

Once hired as a probationary employee, the District had to issue a notice of
nonreelection to prevent Esquivel from becoming a permanent employee. (§ 44929.21, subd.
(b); Bakersfield, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th 1260, at pp. 1278-1279.)
It did not do so, and
Esquivel acquired permanent status. While the District contends that Esquivel separated from
employment at the end of the 2005-2006 school year and was rehired at the start of the 2006-
2007 school year, no evidence was presented to establish such fact. Nevertheless, it is
unnecessary to establish Esquivel’s exact seniority date to determine the order of termination
between him and Respondent Wanke for the purpose of the instant proceeding, as even the later
seniority date assigned to him by the District gives him greater seniority than Wanke, August 8,
2006 versus August 4, 2009.

7.

Cause exists to terminate the services of Respondents Reimert and Wanke, by

reason of factual finding numbers 1 through 15, and legal conclusion numbers 1 through 6.

ORDER

The Accusation is sustained and the District may notify Respondents Reimert and
Wanke that their services will not be needed during the 2010-2011 school year due to the
reduction of particular kinds of services.
