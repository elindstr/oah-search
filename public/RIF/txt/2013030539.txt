Respondents.

PROPOSED DECISION

Howard W. Cohen, Administrative Law Judge with the Office of Administrative

Hearings, heard this matter on April 17, 2013, at Pomona, California.

Howard A. Friedman and Martha I. Casillas, Attorneys at Law, of Fagen Friedman &

Fulfrost, LLP, represented Pomona Unified School District (District).

Joshua Adams, Attorney at Law, of Rothner, Segall & Greenstone, represented 88 of

the 90 respondents named in Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof. The other
two respondents, Michelle Jean Allen and Chung-Mo Paul J. Kim, appeared on their own
behalf. As stipulated by all parties, due notice of the time and place of hearing was given as
required by law, and all pre-hearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.

Oral and documentary evidence was received and the record was closed. The matter

was submitted on April 17, 2013.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Richard Martinez, Superintendent of the District, acting in his official

capacity, caused all pleadings, notices, and other papers, including the Accusation, to be filed
and served upon respondents under the provisions of Education Code1 sections 44949 and
44955. All pre-hearing jurisdictional requirements have been met with respect to the District
and all respondents.

1 Except as otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Education Code.

Respondents are certificated employees of the District.

2.

3.

On March 5, 2013, the District’s Governing Board adopted a resolution,

Resolution Number 20, to reduce and discontinue the services of 108.4 full-time equivalent
(FTE) certificated positions at the close of the 2012-2013 school year, as follows:

Counselor……………………………………………….

2.0

Elementary Teacher……………………………………. 38.6

Intervention Teacher……………………………………. 1.0

Intervention Specialist…………………………………..

2.0

Secondary Teacher – English…………………………… 6.0

Secondary Teacher – Social Science……………………. 5.0

Secondary Teacher – Mathematics……………………… 8.0

Secondary Teacher – Physical Science………………….. 2.0

Secondary Teacher – Earth Science……………………... 2.0

Secondary Teacher – Music……………………………...

.8

Secondary Teacher – Foreign Language –Spanish……… 3.0

Secondary Teacher – Business………………………….

2.0

Secondary Teacher – Physical Education………………. 5.0

Secondary Teacher – Health……………………………. 1.0

Teacher Specialist/Academic Coach…………………… 13.0

Teaching Teacher Specialist……………………………. 9.0

Teacher on Assignment (TOA)…………………………. 8.0

Total…………………………………….………...……. 108.4

4.

These services are “particular kinds of services” that may be reduced or
discontinued within the meaning of section 44955. The Board’s decision to reduce or
discontinue these particular kinds of services was not arbitrary or capricious, but constituted
a proper exercise of discretion. The reduction or discontinuation of these particular kinds of
services related to the welfare of the District and its pupils. The reduction or discontinuation
of particular kinds of services was necessary to decrease the number of certificated
employees of the District as determined by the Board.

2

5.

The Board properly considered all known attrition, resignations, retirements,

deaths, and requests for transfer in determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices
to be delivered to its employees as of March 15, 2013.

6.

The District maintains a seniority list, which contains employees’ seniority

dates, current assignments and locations, credentials, and authorizations. The District
identified the most junior employees working in a particular kind of service being reduced or
discontinued and determined which employees would receive layoff notices.

7.

In its Resolution Number 20, the Board directed the Superintendent or his

designee to serve notices of termination in accordance with and in the manner prescribed by
sections 44949 and 44955.

8.

The Board also adopted criteria to be used in determining the order of

termination of certificated employees who first rendered paid service to the District in a
probationary position on the same date. The Board resolved that the order of termination of
those employees shall be determined by reference to certain tiebreaker criteria and to points
assigned to each category of tiebreaker criteria, as set forth in exhibit A to Board Resolution
20. The Board determined that such criteria best serve the needs of the District and its
students.

9.

On March 12, 2013, under Board Resolution 20, described in Finding 2, and

the provisions of sections 44949 and 44955, the Superintendent’s designee, Assistant
Superintendent Darren A. Knowles, gave written notice to respondents that he had
recommended to the Board that notice be given to respondents that their services will not be
required for the 2012-2013 school year. Respondents requested a hearing to determine
whether there is cause for not employing them for the ensuing school year.

10.

On April 2, 2013, the District filed and timely served an Accusation, copies of

Resolution Number 20, a Statement to Respondent, a blank Notice of Defense, Request for
Discovery, and pertinent sections of the Government and Education Codes upon respondents,
who filed timely Notices of Defense.

11.

During the hearing, the District rescinded the layoff notices issued to

respondents Olga Maritza Alvarez, Kimberly A. Caganap, Noelia Carrillo, Trinh Soai Chan,
Cynthia Corona-Flores, Ivette Decasas, Elizabeth Dimauro, Erika Cristina Duran, Erick W.
Figueroa, Michelle Vega Gonzales, Wanda Y. Hernandez, Philip Jesus Herrera, Diane Lynn
Hubbard-Knight, Islene Leon, James H. Loehrke III, Elizabeth Alison McAllister, Carmen
Mejico, Patricia Melendrez, Rosa Miranda-Zimmer, Christopher A. Mitts, Zachary A.
Moore, Christopher Tran Nguyen, Paula Rafael, Tina Renee Solorzano, Cesar Torres,
Esmeralda Vargas, and Yesenia Zambrano.2

2 The District also rescinded the layoff notices issued to 18 certificated employees

who were not respondents.

The District also made the following seniority list changes:

Sandra Cerda
Arturo Molina
Christopher T. Nguyen
Jennifer N. Dineen

September 25, 2004

August 20, 2003
September 3, 2010

Seniority Date and Status Disputes

13.

Respondent Mariselva Avila does not dispute her assigned seniority date,

February 8, 2011, but testified that she was originally hired as a Probationary 2 employee
and has now attained the status of a permanent employee. The District’s seniority list reflects
that respondent Avila is currently a Probationary 1 employee. Her first paid date of service
was February 8, 2011, which was in the middle of the 2010/2011 school year. The following
school year, 2011/2012, her status was unchanged. Respondent Avila then went on parental
leave on April 7, 2012. She testified that she believes she worked at least 75 percent of the
2011/2012 school year. District records reflect, though, that she was on leave for 62 days out
of 180 work days in that school year, so she worked only about 66 percent of the 2011/2012
school year.3 Respondent Avila testified that Assistant Superintendent Knowles told her
when she was hired that she would start as a Probationary 2 employee. But her employment
contract, dated February 8, 2011, and bearing Respondent Avila’s signature, states that she
was hired as a Probationary 1 employee. Based on the evidence at hearing, the District
established that Respondent Avila should not currently be accorded the status of a permanent
employee.

14.

Respondent Wendy Garcia disputes her assigned seniority date of September

10, 2004. She testified that her correct seniority date should be September 7, 2004. She
testified that she came to school on Labor Day, September 6, 2004, to prepare her classroom,
and taught class on Tuesday, September 7. She also believes she received a letter from the
District two years ago agreeing to change her seniority date to September 7, 2004, but she
cannot not find the letter. The District’s payroll records reflect that Respondent Garcia’s first
date of paid service was September 10, 2004. Respondent Garcia also signed a survey on
February 4, 2011, sent to her by the District on January 20, 2011, verifying that her seniority
date should be September 10, 2004, but she testified that she did not realize when signing the

3 Under section 44908, to be deemed to have served a complete school year, a
probationary employee must have served for at least 75 percent of the number of school days
in the year.

4

survey that seniority is determined by first date of paid service, which was September 7, and
not the date she signed her contract. She was not given a contract to sign until Friday,
September 10, 2004. Assistant Superintendent Knowles testified that he reviewed the
District’s records for the 2004/2005 school year; from those records he determined that the
first day of class was a shortened day on September 8, 2004, and that although teachers may
have reported on September 7, there were no students present in class until the following
day. Respondent Garcia testified that she attended orientation with several other teachers
hired on the same day as she, and that at least one of them has a seniority date of September
7, 2004. The teachers’ orientation date does not establish the first date of paid service,
however. Also, Assistant Superintendent Knowles testified that Respondent Garcia’s name
does not appear on the September 2004 orientation sign-in sheet. Based on the evidence at
hearing, the District established that Respondent Garcia’s seniority date should not be
changed to September 7, 2004.

15.

Respondent Jacquelyn Coe disputes her assigned seniority date of September

10, 2004. She testified that her correct seniority date should be September 7, 2004. She
testified that she attended orientation on September 3, 2004, the Friday before Labor Day
weekend, prepared her classroom the same day, and taught class on Tuesday, September 7.
The District’s payroll records reflect that Respondent Coe’s first date of paid service was
September 10, 2004. Respondent Coe signed a survey, sent to her by the District on January
20, 2011, verifying that her seniority date should be September 10, 2004. Assistant
Superintendent Knowles testified that he reviewed the District’s records for the 2004/2005
school year; from those records he determined that the first day of class was a shortened day
on September 8, 2004, and that although teachers may have reported on September 7, there
were no students present in class until the following day. Based on the evidence at hearing,
the District established that Respondent Coe’s seniority date should not be changed to
September 7, 2004.

16.

It was not established that any of the facts described in Factual Findings 12

through 15 will otherwise affect the layoffs of the involved individuals.

17.

Respondent Patrice Heuring, who has a seniority date of November 29, 2010,

is being bumped by Brandi N. Friedman, who has a seniority date of August 21, 2002, to
teach in the Cal Safe program. Cal Safe is a program for pregnant minors and for male and
female teen parents. Respondent Heuring currently has over 22 students in her Cal Safe
classroom. She also conducts home visits and is responsible for teaching her students through
pregnancy and all the years they remain in school. Respondent Heuring testified that she is
more qualified than Friedman to teach in the Cal Safe program, and that Friedman is not
certificated and competent to teach in the Cal Safe program. Friedman has a clear single
subject credential in health science and biological sciences, among other things. Respondent
Heuring also has a clear single subject credential in health science as well as in psychology
and child development, among other things. Respondent Heuring testified that the District’s
seniority list erroneously omits the fact that her credentials include parenting, and that she
believes that because Friedman does not have a parenting credential, Friedman cannot bump
into the Cal Safe position. Respondent Heuring admitted that she does not know what the

5

minimum credential requirement is for teaching in the Cal Safe program. Assistant
Superintendent Knowles testified that the minimum requirement is a credential in health
science; a parenting credential is not required. The Board eliminated one FTE for health
science, thereby subjecting Friedman to being laid off, but determined that Friedman is
senior to Respondent Heuring and is certificated and competent to teach in the Cal Safe
program, and therefore that Friedman may bump into Respondent Heuring’s position.4
Whether Respondent Heuring is “more qualified” than Friedman is not relevant to whether
Friedman can bump into her position. Based on the evidence at hearing, the District
established that Brandi N. Friedman is certificated and competent to bump into Respondent
Heuring’s position.

18.

Taking into account the changes described above, no junior certificated

employee is scheduled to be retained to perform services that a more senior employee is
certificated and competent to render.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

Jurisdiction for these proceedings exists under sections 44949 and 44955. The

parties complied with all pre-hearing procedural requirements.

The services set forth in Factual Finding 3 are particular kinds of service that

may be reduced or discontinued in accordance with applicable statutes and case law. (See
§ 44955.) The District’s decision to reduce or discontinue the services is neither arbitrary nor
capricious, but rather a proper exercise of the District's discretion.

3.

Cause exists to dismiss the Accusation issued against respondents Olga

Maritza Alvarez, Kimberly A. Caganap, Noelia Carrillo, Trinh Soai Chan, Cynthia Corona-
Flores, Ivette Decasas, Elizabeth Dimauro, Erika Cristina Duran, Erick W. Figueroa,
Michelle Vega Gonzales, Wanda Y. Hernandez, Philip Jesus Herrera, Diane Lynn Hubbard-
Knight, Islene Leon, James H. Loehrke III, Elizabeth Alison McAllister, Carmen Mejico,

Mariselva Avila, Wendy Garcia, Jacquelyn Coe, and Patrice Heuring, as set forth in Factual
Findings 12, 14, 15, and 17.

5.

No junior certificated employee is scheduled to be retained to perform services

which a more senior employee is certificated and competent to render.

4 No permanent employee may be “terminated while any probationary employee, or
any other employee with less seniority, is retained to render a service which said permanent
employee is certificated and competent to render.” (§ 44955, subd. (b).)
