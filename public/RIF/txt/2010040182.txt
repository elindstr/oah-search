SUMMARY OF PROPOSED DECISION 

The Governing Board of the Kern High School District (Board) determined to 

 
 
reduce or discontinue particular kinds of services provided by teachers and other 
certificated employees for budgetary reasons.  The decision was not related to the 
competency and dedication of the individuals whose services are proposed to be 
reduced or eliminated.   
 
 
involving review of credentials and seniority, “bumping,” and breaking ties between 
employees with the same first dates of paid service.  The selection process was in 
accordance with the requirements of the Education Code.  
  
  

District staff carried out the Board’s decision by using a selection process

NUMBER OF FULL-TIME
EQUIVALENT POSITIONS

7.  On March 9, 2010, the Board took action to reduce or discontinue the 

 
following particular kinds of services for the 2010-2011 school year: 
 
SERVICES 
 
 
 
Social Studies  
 
 
 
 
Fine Arts 
 
Career Technical Education (CTE)   
 
 
 
Modern Language 
 
 
 
PE/Health 
 
Lerdo (Kern County Contract/Jail Education) 
 
Nursing/Health Program 
Mount Vernon (Business) 
 
Mount Vernon (Social Studies/20-hour position)   
Vocational Credential 
 
 
Total   
 
 
vacancies in School Year 2010-2011 due to retirements, release of temporary 
teachers, and resignations.   
 
 
9.  A Board resolution established tie-breaker criteria for determining the 
relative seniority of certificated employees who first rendered paid service on the 
same date.  It provided that the order of termination shall be based on the needs of the 
District. 
 
10.  The District maintains a seniority list which contains employees’ seniority 
 
dates (first date of paid service as a probationary employee), current assignments and 
locations, advanced degrees, credentials, and authorizations.  Credential and 
authorization data are obtained from the records of the County Office of Education, at 
which certificated employees must register such documents.   
 

8.  Subsequent to adoption of the Board’s Resolution, the District identified 

33.0 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.  The District used the seniority list to develop a proposed layoff and 
“bumping” list of the least senior employees currently assigned in the various services 
being reduced.  In determining who would be laid off for each kind of service 
reduced, the District counted the number of reductions not covered by the known 
vacancies, and determined the impact on incumbent staff in inverse order of seniority.  
The District then checked the credentials of affected individuals and whether they 
could “bump” other less senior employees.   
 
12.  The District used information from its seniority list to apply the tie-
 
breaker criteria of the Board Resolution.  However, following the rescission of certain 
preliminary notices, no tie-breaker issues arose.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1.  All notice and jurisdictional requirements set forth in Education Code 

 
 
sections 44949 and 44955 were met. 
 
 
2.  All of the identified services are particular kinds of services that could be 
reduced or discontinued under Code section 44955.  The Board’s decision to reduce 
or discontinue the identified services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and was a 
proper exercise of its discretion. Cause for the reduction or discontinuation of services 
relates solely to the welfare of the District’s schools and pupils within the meaning of 
Code section 44949. 
 
 
3.  A District may reduce services within the meaning of Education Code 
section 44955, subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to 
students shall not, thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce 
services’ by determining that proffered services shall be reduced in extent because 
fewer employees are made available to deal with the pupils involved.”  (Rutherford v. 
Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167, 178-179.)   
 
 
4.  Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees of the District 
due to the reduction and discontinuation of particular kinds of services.  The District 
identified the certificated employees providing the particular kinds of services that the 
Board directed be reduced or discontinued.   
 
 
services which a more senior employee is certificated and competent to render. 
 
 
6.  A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a 
continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to fill.  In doing so, 
the senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that 
position.  (Lacy v. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469.)  Junior 
teachers may be given retention priority over senior teachers if the junior teachers 
possess superior skills or capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack.  
(Santa Clara Federation of Teachers, Local 2393, v. Governing Board of Santa Clara 
Unified School District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831, 842-843.)

ORDER

given to the respondents that their services will not be required for the 2010-2011 
school year because of reduction or discontinuance of particular kinds of services.
