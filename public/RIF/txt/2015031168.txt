the 2014/2015 school year on the condition that certain certificated PKS would be reduced or 
eliminated for the 2015/2016 school year. 
 
 
7.  When the District began drafting its budget for the upcoming 2015/2016 
school year, the Calaveras County Office of Education wanted the Board to take “early 
action” to show its commitment to reducing its budget.  Therefore, it was recommended that 
the Board implement the process of laying off certificated employees for the 2015/2016 
school year in two phases. 
 
The Board adopted Resolution No. 2014/15-08 on October 21, 2014, reducing 
 
or eliminating the PKS identified above as “phase 1” of its process of laying off certificated 
employees for the 2015/2016 school year. 
 
 
the District’s process of laying off certificated employees for the 2015/2016 school year. 
 
10.  As the District began to have a better understanding of its enrollment and 
 
concomitant staffing needs at the high school level for the upcoming 2015/2016 school year, 
it determined that it could reduce the “High School Social Science” PKS by only 1.0 FTE.  
Therefore, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2014/15-23 on March 10, 2015, replacing 1.0 
FTE of “High School Social Science” with 1.0 FTE of “High School Art.”5

4 Ms. Howard, Ms. Maddock, Ms. Mendosa, and Mr. Mizicko did not request a 

hearing to determine if cause exists to reduce or eliminate their services for the upcoming 
2015/2016 school year and, therefore, are not parties to this action.  (Ed. Code, § 44949, 
subd. (b).) 

 
5 Ms. Stanko confirmed at hearing that the total full-time equivalent reduction of 7.0 
FTE authorized by Resolution No. 2014/15-15 should be reduced by 1.0 FTE as a result of 
the Board’s adoption of Resolution No. 2014/15-23.

“Competency” Criteria 
 
 
following “competency” criteria: 
 

11. 

Resolution Nos. 2014/15-08, 2014/15-15, and 2014/15-23 each specify the 

“Competency” for the purpose of bumping and reemployment 
rights as described in Education Code section 44955, 44956 and 
44957 shall be based upon current possession of a preliminary 
or clear credential for the subject matter or grade level to which 
the employee may bump or be assigned; a BCLAD if the 
assignment requires such authorization; and a properly filed EL 
authorization valid for 2015-2016 school year which authorizes 
instruction to EL students.  Further, due to the District’s specific 
need to hire and retain only highly qualified teachers in 
academic subject areas, “competency” shall, in accordance with 
the NCLB, require current confirmation of academic subject 
competency, or verifiable eligibility for competency if not 
previously reviewed by the District, in all subjects of a proposed 
assignment, including assignments teaching multiple academic 
subjects and assignments in secondary alternative schools. 

12. 

The “High School Art” PKS 

Suzanne Smith is a permanent certificated employee of the District.  She has a 

 
Respondents’ Contentions 
 
 
 
 
seniority date of July 20, 2006, and is ranked “104” on the District’s Certificated Seniority 
List.  She has a clear single subject credential in art.  She has taught art to all grade levels at 
Calaveras High School since she began her employment with the District.  Ms. Smith is 
“highly qualified” in art in accordance with the NCLB.  She received notice from 
Superintendent Campbell that her services would be reduced or eliminated for the 2015/2016 
school year as discussed above. 
 
 
District.  She has a seniority date of October 14, 2004, and is ranked “97” on the District’s 
Certificated Seniority List.  She has a clear multiple subject credential, with supplemental 
authorizations in science and art.  Her supplemental authorization in art allows her to teach 
art in Grade 9 and below. 
 

Brenda (a.k.a. Karen) Wallace is a permanent certificated employee of the 

13. 

On May 6, 2014, however, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2013/14-23 authorizing 

Ms. Wallace to teach ceramics to Grades 9 through 12 during the 2014/2015 school year 
pursuant to Education Code section 44263.6  Ms. Wallace accepted such assignment, and she 

                                                 

6 Education Code section 44263 provides:

taught ceramics to Grades 9 through 12 at Calaveras High School during the 2014/2015 
school year.  Prior to that assignment, she taught science at Toyon Middle School.  She is 
“highly qualified” to teach art in accordance with the NCLB based on her completion of 32 
semester units in that field. 

There was a discrepancy in the testimony at hearing about the anticipated 

enrollment in art at Calaveras High School for the upcoming 2015/2016 school year.  Ms. 
Smith explained that her principal, Mr. Merrill, told her that she was receiving a preliminary 
layoff notice because the anticipated enrollment in art is 90.  Ms. Stanko, on the other hand, 
explained that Mr. Merrill told her that there are only 60 students actually enrolled in art for 
next year, and his staff added an additional 30 students to that number because several 
students often do not indicate an “elective” when they turn in their registration sheet.   

 
For the reasons discussed below, a resolution of this discrepancy is not outcome 

determinative. 
 
15.  Ms. Stanko will seek Board-authorization for Ms. Wallace to continue 
teaching ceramics at Calaveras High School during the upcoming 2015/2016 school year on 
April 21, 2015. 
 
16.  Once Ms. Stanko determined that Ms. Smith was the most junior certificated 

employee teaching High School Art, she was obligated to make an initial determination 
whether Ms. Smith is certificated and competent to perform the services of any certificated 
employee with less seniority who is being retained.  (Hildebrandt v. St. Helena Unified 
School District (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 334, 340.)  Ms. Stanko explained that after she 
identified Ms. Smith as the most junior certificated employee teaching High School Art, she 
reviewed the District’s Certificated Seniority List to determine if there was a more junior 
certificated employee who was performing a service that Ms. Smith was certificated and 
competent to perform.  Concluding there was none, a preliminary layoff notice was issued to 
Ms. Smith.  Ms. Stanko satisfied the District’s duty under Hildebrandt. 

 

                                                                                                                                                             
A teacher licensed pursuant to the provisions of this article may 
be assigned, with his or her consent, to teach a single subject 
class in which he or she has 18 semester hours of coursework or 
nine semester hours of upper division or graduate course work 
or a multiple subject class if he or she holds at least 60 semester 
hours equally distributed among the 10 areas of a diversified 
major set forth in Section 44314.  A three-semester-unit 
variance in any of the required 10 areas may be allowed.  The 
governing board of the school district by resolution shall 
provide specific authorization for the assignment.  The 
authorization of the governing board shall remain valid for one 
year and may be renewed annually. 

  6 

 

17.  Ms. Smith argued at hearing that Ms. Wallace, the certificated employee being 

retained to teach High School Art during the 2015/2016 school year, is not “competent” to 
perform that service, as that term has been defined by the Board.  As discussed in Factual 
Finding 11, the Board adopted the following definition of “competency:”  “‘Competency’ for 
the purpose of bumping and reemployment rights as described in Education Code section 
44955, 44956 and 44957 shall be based upon current possession of a preliminary or clear 
credential for the subject matter or grade level to which the employee may bump or be 
assigned … .”  Ms. Smith holds a single subject credential in art, whereas Ms. Wallace holds 
a multiple subject credential with a supplemental authorization in art and, as such, is 
credentialed to teach art only in Grades 9 and below.  Therefore, Ms. Smith argued, Ms. 
Wallace is not “competent” to teach all grades of High School Art, whereas she is. 

 
18. 

 
20. 

The Board’s definition of “competency” is relevant only to determining Ms. 

Smith’s right to “bump into” a service being performed by another certificated employee 
with less seniority who is being retained.  (See, Bledsoe v. Biggs Unified School District 
(2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 127, 131fn. 1 [“For purposes of a school district reduction in force, 
‘bumping’ refers to a senior teacher moving into the position of a junior teacher.”]; see also, 
Duax v. Kern Community College District (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 555, 569 [a school 
district’s board may adopt competency criteria for determining bumping rights].)  Here, Ms. 
Smith is the junior certificated employee and, therefore, has no right to bump into the service 
being performed by Ms. Wallace.  (Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association v. 
Bakersfield City School District (2007) 145 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1273 [“No permanent 
employee may be laid off if a probationary employee, or any other employee of less 
seniority, occupies a position the permanent employee is certificated and competent to fill.”]; 
citing, Ed. Code, § 44955, former subd. (c), now subd. (b).)  Ms. Smith did not establish 
legal grounds for compelling the District to rescind her preliminary layoff notice. 
 

Angela Howard’s seniority date 
 
19.  Angela Howard is a certificated employee of the District.  Her first date of 

paid service with the District was July 1, 2013.  While she is not “ranked” on the District’s 
Certificated Seniority List, her name and pertinent information appears on that List between 
rankings “126” and “127.”  She holds a clear multiple subject credential and a preliminary 
administrative services credential. 

The Board hired Ms. Howard to fill the position of “Elementary Assistant 

Teaching Principal” at Jenny Lind Elementary School, effective July 1, 2013.  The current 
2014/2015 school year is her second year in that position.  She has no prior teaching 
experience with the District.  It is anticipated that Ms. Howard will be assigned to a teaching 
position consistent with her credentials for the upcoming 2015/2016 school year. 

 
21.  At hearing, Ms. Stanko was unable to state with specificity the number of 
hours Ms. Howard spends performing administrative duties versus teaching duties.  She 
stated, however, that Ms. Howard spends “less than 50 percent” of her day teaching students, 
estimating that it is between “two to three hours each day.” 

  7 

 

22.  Ms. Stanko stated that she determined Ms. Howard’s seniority date with the 

District to be July 1, 2013, her first date of paid service with the District.  While Ms. Howard 
was hired to fill an administrative position, Ms. Stanko testified to her understanding that 
Education Code section 44956.5 allows her to give Ms. Howard credit towards her seniority 
with the District for the two years she has served as a site administrator at Jenny Lind 
Elementary School. 

 
23.  Ms. Daniel-Cejas, Ms. Hutt, Ms. Pettitt, and Ms. Wilson, all of whom have 
seniority dates after July 1, 2013, argued that the date on which Ms. Howard first rendered 
paid service in the District is irrelevant because the entire language of Education Code 
section 44845 reads:  “Every probationary or permanent employee employed after June 30, 
1947, shall be deemed to have been employed on that date upon which he first rendered paid 
service in a probationary position.”  (Italics added.)  According to respondents, Ms. Howard 
was not a probationary certificated employee because her employment contract identified her 
classification as “Management,” whereas employment contracts for teachers newly hired by 
the District list their classification as “probationary.” 

Respondent’s argument is not persuasive.  Ms. Stanko correctly interpreted 
and applied Education Code section 44956.5, which gives school site administrators credit 
towards their seniority date with the District for purposes of Education Code sections 44955 
and 44956 of “up to a maximum of three years seniority while serving as site 
administrators.”  Since Ms. Howard has served as an a site administrator at Jenny Lind 
Elementary School for less than three years, Ms. Stanko gave her credit for all her years with 
the District. 

 
25.  No permanent or probationary certificated employee with less seniority is 

being retained to render a service for which respondents are certificated and competent to 
perform. 

 
24. 

 
26. 

The reduction or elimination of the particular kinds of services set forth in 

 
Resolution Nos. 2014/15-08, 2014/15-15, and 2014/15-23 are related to the welfare of the 
schools and the students thereof within the meaning of Education Code sections 44949 and 
44955.  The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue those services was neither arbitrary 
nor capricious, but rather a proper exercise of its discretion.  
 
 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

 
 
regard to a school district’s authority to layoff certificated employees: 
 

Education Code section 44949 provides, in pertinent part, the following with 

(a)(1)  No later than March 15 and before an employee is given 
notice by the governing board that his or her services will not be 
required for the ensuing year for the reasons specified in Section 
44955, the governing board and the employee shall be given 

  8 

 

written notice by the superintendent of the district or his or her 
designee, or in the case of a school district that has no 
superintendent by the clerk or secretary of the governing board, 
that it has been recommended that the notice be given to the 
employee, and stating the reasons therefor. 
 
(2)  Until the employee has requested a hearing as provided in 
subdivision (b) or has waived his or her right to a hearing, the 
notice and the reasons therefor shall be confidential and shall 
not be divulged by any person, except as may be necessary in 
the performance of duties.  However, the violation of this 
requirement of confidentiality, in and of itself, shall not in any 
manner be construed as affecting the validity of any hearing 
conducted pursuant to this section. 
 
(b)  The employee may request a hearing to determine if there is 
cause for not reemploying him or her for the ensuing year.  A 
request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be delivered to 
the person who sent the notice pursuant to subdivision (a), on or 
before a date specified in that subdivision, which shall not be 
less than seven days after the date on which the notice is served 
upon the employee.  If an employee fails to request a hearing on 
or before the date specified, his or her failure to do so shall 
constitute his or her waiver of his or her right to a hearing.  The 
notice provided for in subdivision (a) shall advise the employee 
of the provisions of this subdivision. 
 
(c)  If a hearing is requested by the employee, the proceeding 
shall be conducted and a decision made in accordance with 
Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of 
Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code and the governing 
board shall have all the power granted to an agency in that 
chapter, except that all of the following shall apply: 
 
(1)  The respondent shall file his or her notice of participation, if 
any, within five days after service upon him or her of the 
District Statement of Reduction in Force and he or she shall be 
notified of this five-day period for filing in the District 
Statement of Reduction in Force. 
 
[¶]…[¶] 
 
(3)  The hearing shall be conducted by an administrative law 
judge who shall prepare a proposed decision, containing 
findings of fact and a determination as to whether the charges 

  9 

 

 

 
 

The parties stipulated at hearing that the District complied with all notice and 

jurisdictional requirements set forth above. 

 
2. 

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), provides the following: 

sustained by the evidence are related to the welfare of the 
schools and the pupils of the schools.  The proposed decision 
shall be prepared for the governing board and shall contain a 
determination as to the sufficiency of the cause and a 
recommendation as to disposition.  However, the governing 
board shall make the final determination as to the sufficiency of 
the cause and disposition.  None of the findings, 
recommendations, or determinations contained in the proposed 
decision prepared by the administrative law judge shall be 
binding on the governing board.  Nonsubstantive procedural 
errors committed by the school district or governing board of 
the school district shall not constitute cause for dismissing the 
charges unless the errors are prejudicial errors.  Copies of the 
proposed decision shall be submitted to the governing board and 
to the employee on or before May 7 of the year in which the 
proceeding is commenced.  All expenses of the hearing, 
including the cost of the administrative law judge, shall be paid 
by the governing board from the district funds. 

Whenever in any school year the average daily attendance in all 
of the schools of a district for the first six months in which 
school is in session shall have declined below the corresponding 
period of either of the previous two school years, whenever the 
governing board determines that attendance in a district will 
decline in the following year as a result of the termination of an 
interdistrict tuition agreement as defined in Section 46304, 
whenever a particular kind of service is to be reduced or 
discontinued not later than the beginning of the following school 
year, or whenever the amendment of state law requires the 
modification of curriculum, and when in the opinion of the 
governing board of the district it shall have become necessary 
by reason of any of these conditions to decrease the number of 
permanent employees in the district, the governing board may 
terminate the services of not more than a corresponding 
percentage of the certificated employees of the district, 
permanent as well as probationary, at the close of the school 
year.  Except as otherwise provided by statute, the services of no 
permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions of 
this section while any probationary employee, or any other  

 10 

 

employee with less seniority, is retained to render a service 
which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to 
render. 

5. 

3. 

Once a school district’s governing board authorizes the reduction or 

A “certificated person” is defined in Education Code section 44006, which 

4.  When effectuating a reduction in force, the general rule is that certificated 

 
 
provides:  “The term ‘certificated person’ refers to a person who holds one or more 
documents such as a certificate, a credential, or a life diploma, which singly or in 
combination license the holder to engage in the school service designated in the document or 
documents. 
 
 
employees must be laid off in inverse order based on seniority.  (See, e.g., Bakersfield 
Elementary Teachers Association v. Bakersfield City School District (2007) 145 Cal.App.4th 
1260, 1273 [“No permanent employee may be laid off if a probationary employee, or any 
other employee of less seniority, occupies a position the permanent employee is certificated 
and competent to fill.”]; citing, Ed. Code, § 44955, former subd. (c), now subd. (b).) 
 
 
discontinuance of particular kinds of service, the district’s first step is to identify those 
certificated employees providing the particular services to be reduced or discontinued.  (Ed. 
Code, § 44955, subd. (b).)  The district has a mandatory duty to make an initial determination 
whether those certificated employees who are performing the services to be reduced or 
discontinued are certificated and competent to perform the services of any certificated 
employee with less seniority who is being retained.  (Hildebrandt v. St. Helena Unified 
School District (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 334, 340.)  But once that initial determination has 
been made, the burden shifts to the certificated employee asserting the right to bump the 
junior employee to prove that the former is certificated and competent to perform the service 
for which the latter is being retained.  (Moreland Teachers Association v. Kurze (1980) 109 
Cal.App.3d 648, 656.) 
 
 
“shall be made at the time of employment and thereafter in the month of July of each school 
year.”  (Ed. Code, § 44916.)  “‘The Education Code establishes four possible classifications 
for certificated employees:  permanent, probationary, substitute and temporary.’”  (Stockton 
Teachers Association CTA/NEA v. Stockton Unified School District (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 
446, 455, internal quotes and citation omitted.)  “[P]robationary status is the default 
classification when the Code does not specify another classification.”  (Id. at p. 456; Ed.  
Code, § 44915.) 
 
 
position, however, Education Code section 44956.5 provides the following:
