BEFORE THE 
LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 

 
 
 
In the Matter of the Reduction in Force of: 
 
CERTIFICATED TEACHERS OF THE 
LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF 
EDUCATION, 
 
 
                                               Respondents. 
 
 
 

 
OAH No. 2019030483 

 
 

PROPOSED DECISION 

This matter was heard by Eric Sawyer, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), Office of 

 
 
Administrative Hearings, State of California, on April 25, 2019, in Downey.  The record was 
closed and the matter submitted for decision at the conclusion of the hearing. 
 

Patrick Saldaña, Deputy General Counsel, represented complainant Arthur J. Cunha, 
Ed.D., Chief Human Resources Officer, Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE). 

 
Respondents are the 102 individuals identified in exhibits 8 and 9.  Carlos R. Perez, 

The Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools (County Superintendent) decided 

Esq., and Alejandra Gonzalez-Bedoy, Esq., represented the 13 respondents identified in 
exhibit A. 
 
  
to reduce 154.75 full-time equivalent positions due to a budget deficit.  None of the County 
Superintendent’s specific layoff decisions were challenged by respondents.  The arguments 
made by two respondents that new “skipping” categories should have been created for them 
by the County Superintendent were not persuasive.  Therefore, complainant established by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the County Superintendent’s proposed layoff meets the 
requirements of the Education Code and honors the seniority of LACOE’s certificated staff. 
 
 

FACTUAL FINDINGS 

 
Parties and Jurisdiction 
 

1. 

The District Statement of Reduction in Force was made and filed by 

complainant in his official capacity with LACOE. 

 
2. 

3. 

 
8. 

Respondents are certificated employees of LACOE. 

On March 1, 2019, County Superintendent Deborah Duardo, M.S.W., Ed.D., 

adopted Resolution No. 1-S to reduce or eliminate the particular kinds of certificated services 
specified therein no later than the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year by a total of 
154.75 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. 

 
4. 

 
The County Superintendent further determined it necessary by reason of 
Resolution No. 1-S to decrease the number of certificated employees at the close of the 
present school year by a corresponding number of FTE positions, and directed complainant, 
or his designees, to proceed accordingly by notifying the appropriate certificated employees. 
 

5. 

On March 4, 2019, pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955,1 

complainant notified the County Superintendent of his recommendation that notice be given 
to certain certificated staff that their services will not be required for the ensuing school year, 
and stating the reasons therefore. 
 

6. 

On or before March 15, 2019, pursuant to the above-described resolution and 
the provisions of sections 44949 and 44955, complainant gave written notice to respondents 
and other certificated staff (preliminary layoff notice) of his recommendation to the County 
Superintendent to lay them off for the 2019-2020 school year.  The certificated staff who 
received the preliminary layoff notices, including respondents, are identified in attachment A 
to the District Statement of Reduction in Force.  (Ex. 2, pp. 18-22.) 
 

7. 

Some respondents served pursuant to a temporary contract, and they were non-
reelected for that reason pursuant to the County Superintendent’s Resolution No. 2-S.  Other 
respondents served pursuant to provisional credentials, and they were non-reelected for that 
reason pursuant to the County Superintendent’s Resolution No. 4-S.  All these respondents 
were provided with the preliminary layoff notice as a precaution, so that they could 
participate in and exercise any claimed rights in this matter. 

Respondents timely filed Notices of Participation, or were deemed by LACOE 

to have done so, requesting a hearing to challenge their layoff. 
 

9. 

Prior to the hearing, LACOE rescinded the preliminary layoff notices issued to 

LaShonda Tillmon, Martin Navaroli, and Ella Dennen. 
 
Reduction or Elimination of Particular Kinds of Services  
 

10. 

Resolution No. 1-S provides for the reduction or elimination of the following 

particular kinds of services:

11. 

The County Superintendent’s decision to reduce or eliminate 154.75 FTE 
positions was the result of the budget deficit caused by the transfer of remaining special 
education services to special education local plan areas (SELPAs) and school districts in the 
county, as well as the reduction of incarcerated youth placed in LACOE schools. 
 

12. 

The services or programs set forth in Factual Finding 10 are particular kinds of 

services that may be reduced or eliminated within the meaning of section 44955.  The 
County Superintendent’s determination to reduce or eliminate these services is within her 

4

sound discretion and was not arbitrary or capricious.  The reduction or elimination of 
services relates to the welfare of LACOE and its pupils, and, based on the County 
Superintendent’s determination, it has become necessary to decrease the number of 
certificated employees. 
 

13. 

LACOE considered personnel changes due to the releases of provisionally 

credentialed and temporary employees in making its determination to issue preliminary 
layoff notices, and will consider retirements that occur before May 15, 2019. 
 

14. 

LACOE maintains a seniority list which contains employees’ seniority dates, 

current assignments and locations, credentials, and authorizations.  LACOE used the 
seniority list to identify the most junior employees working in a particular kind of service 
being reduced or eliminated and to determine which of those employees would receive 
preliminary layoff notices.  In November 2018, LACOE certificated staff were notified of 
their respective seniority dates, and requested to advise LACOE’s Human Resource Services 
Division if a stated seniority date was incorrect or if they had obtained any additional 
credentials not already registered with LACOE’s Credentials Unit. 
 

15. 

The County Superintendent also adopted Resolution No. 3-S, which contained 

criteria used in determining the order of termination of certificated employees who first 
rendered paid probationary service to LACOE on the same date.  The County Superintendent 
determined such criteria best served the needs of LACOE and its pupils.  Respondents did 
not challenge the tie-breaking criteria, nor did it affect any particular layoff decision. 
 
Skipping 
 
 
 

RESOLUTION NO. 5-S 

16. 

Pursuant to Resolution No. 5-S, the County Superintendent determined to 

retain certain certificated staff in the particular kinds of services identified in Factual Finding 
10, regardless of seniority, who, by their training, experience, and assignment, meet the 
following criteria:  Probationary or permanent certificated employees who are currently 
assigned to the Los Angeles County Outdoor Science School as an Outdoor Education 
teacher possessing specialized training and at least two years’ experience in a residential 
outdoor science school.  Respondents do not challenge the validity of this skip decision. 
 
 
 

CHRISTOPHER ANAYA 

17. 

Respondent Anaya teaches at the International Polytechnic High School 

(IPoly) in Pomona.  IPoly educators teach content by creating cross-curricular group projects 
for students, instead of using textbooks.  Respondent Anaya argues the County 
Superintendent should have used her discretion to skip IPoly teachers because it takes special 
training and experience to teach in the IPoly program. 
 

 

5

18. 

Respondent Anaya was assigned to IPoly in February 2017.  He took two 

courses to prepare for teaching at IPoly.  During the school year, IPoly teachers regularly 
meet with each other to create and implement their cross-curricular projects.  IPoly teachers 
also meet over the summer to plan the cross-curricular projects.  Respondent Anaya has 
taught at IPoly for the past two school years.  This is the special experience and training 
respondent Anaya contends should have warranted the County Superintendent to decide to 
skip IPoly teachers.  (Ex. C, attach. 1.) 
 

19. 

In support of his position, respondent Anaya submitted many letters and notes 

from students who attest to his excellence as a teacher and the importance of the IPoly 
program.  (Ex. C, attach. 2.)  He also presented certificates from several trainings and 
workshops he has attended since teaching at IPoly.  (Ex. C, attach. 3.) 
 

20.  A.  Respondent Anaya also points out that teacher Shawn Strand left IPoly in 
January 2019 to take a Teacher on Special Assignment (TOSA) Instructional Media position 
and that Mr. Strand’s IPoly position remains vacant.  Respondent Anaya argues the vacant 
position should be used to spare one respondent from being laid off.   

 
 

 

C.  In any event, school districts and county superintendents have discretion to 

B.  Human Resource Services Director III Nick Stephany, Ed.D., testified that 

  
Mr. Strand’s TOSA position is temporary and not currently in next school year’s budget.  
This means it is likely there will not be a vacancy at IPoly next school year caused by Mr. 
Strand’s TOSA assignment this year.   
 
  
“make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that employees shall be retained to 
render any service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render.”  (§ 44955, 
subd. (c).)  Therefore, even if Mr. Strand’s former position at IPoly remains vacant, LACOE 
has the discretion to make assignments and reassignments for the next school year at IPoly, 
and how LACOE exercises that discretion is not an issue to be decided in this case. 
 
  
 

DAVID OLIVARES 

21. 

Respondent Olivares teaches female students at LACOE’s Central Juvenile 

Court School (Central School).  Among his three teaching credentials is a clear single subject 
credential in history. 
 

22. 

Respondent Olivares contends all the single subject credentialed teachers at 

Central School have been laid off.  He argues the lack of single subject credentialed teachers 
at Central School will prevent the school from offering what are known as “A-G courses,” 
which is core curriculum that meets admission requirements of the University of California 
(UC) and California State University (CSU) systems.  This is because only single subject 
credentialed teachers are qualified to teach A-G courses.  (Ex. B.)  In fact, respondent 
Olivares contends this has happened to Central School students at LACOE for the past 
several years.  (Ex. B, attach. 9, p. 1.) 
 

 

6

23. 

Because other schools at LACOE offer A-G courses, respondent Olivares 
argues LACOE is depriving juvenile court school students of their constitutional Equal 
Protection rights by not offering to them the education that other LACOE students receive.  
Though not clear, it appears respondent Olivares argues that he and other single subject 
credentialed Central School teachers should be skipped to address this problem. 
 

24.  However, respondent Olivares conceded on cross-examination that he teaches 
all subjects to his students in a self-contained classroom.  Since he does not have a credential 
that covers English language assignments, he is not qualified to teach an A-G English course, 
and therefore his students have not received credit for English if they apply to the UC or 
CSU systems.  In addition, respondent Olivares acknowledged that five single subject 
credentialed Central School teachers senior to him are not being laid off, indicating Central 
School will still have single subject credentialed teachers next school year.  These facts 
indicate the present layoff will not change the A-G course situation at Central School, which 
undermines respondent Olivares’ argument. 
 
Overall Finding on Seniority 
 

25. 

Taking into account the findings above, no junior certificated employee is 

scheduled to be retained to perform services that a more senior employee is certificated and 
competent to render. 
 
 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

In administrative hearings involving personnel matters, the burden of proof is 
on the agency prosecuting the charges.  (See, e.g., Parker v. City of Fountain Valley (1981) 
127 Cal.App.3d 99, 113; Gardner v. Commission on Prof. Competence (1985) 164 
Cal.App.3d 1035.)  In this case involving the employment rights of respondents, the County 
Superintendent bears the burden of proof.  As no other law or statute requires otherwise, the 
standard of proof in this case is the preponderance of the evidence.  (Evid. Code, § 115.) 
 

2. 

All notice and jurisdictional requirements of sections 44949 and 44955 were 

met.  (Factual Findings 1-8.) 
 

3. 

A.  In this case, respondents have not challenged any of the County 

Superintendent’s layoff decisions.  Instead, respondents Anaya and Olivares contend 
additional skipping categories should have been created for them. 

 
 

B.  Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), permits a school district or county 

  
superintendent to deviate from the order of seniority in teacher layoffs when “the district 
demonstrates a specific need for personnel to teach a specific course or course of study . . . 
and that the employee [who is retained] has special training and experience necessary to 
teach that course or course of study . . . which others with more seniority do not possess.” 

 

 

7

 

 

 

D1.  Section 44955, subdivision (d)(2), does provide for skipping junior 

C.  In this case, section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), provides the exclusive 

  
purview of skipping decisions to school boards or county superintendents, not to teachers, 
parents or students.  Therefore, the ALJ has no jurisdiction to create new skipping categories. 
 
 
personnel for purposes of “maintaining or achieving compliance with constitutional 
requirements related to equal protection of the laws.”  However, aside from the fact 
respondent Olivares did not establish that the instant layoff will affect the A-G course 
situation at Central School, the type of skipping provided by subdivision (d)(2) is solely 
within the discretion of the County Superintendent, not a teacher.  In this case, respondent 
Olivares has had other forums to complain about LACOE’s alleged deprivation of juvenile 
court school students’ rights.  According to him, he has known of this problem for several 
years, but apparently has taken no steps to address his grievance about it, until he was given 
his preliminary layoff notice.  However, this layoff proceeding is not the appropriate forum 
to litigate the equal protection problem described by respondent Olivares. 
 
  
D2.  Respondent Olivares cites to the judgment in the Los Angeles County 
Superior Court case of Reed v. State of California (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2010, No. BC 
432420)2 as precedent that such challenges may be made in a layoff proceeding by students 
or teachers.  However, that case involved a declaratory and injunctive relief lawsuit brought 
against several defendants in the Superior Court, not a skipping argument made in an 
administrative proceeding involving school teacher layoffs. 
 
  
proposed by certificated staff, neither respondent Anaya nor respondent Olivares established 
they have the kind of special training and experience required by section 44955, subdivision 
(d)(1), necessary to teach a specific course or course of study and therefore justify being 
skipped.  Respondent Olivares has a single subject credential, which in itself is not special or 
unique.  Respondent Anaya took two training courses before teaching at IPoly.  It is not clear 
that those two training courses were conditions precedent to being able to teach at IPoly.  
Though the IPoly program appears to be unique, respondent Anaya failed to demonstrate he 
possesses special training and experience that another teacher assigned to IPoly would be 
required to have in order to teach there.  (Factual Findings 17-24.) 
 

E.  Finally, even if the ALJ has jurisdiction to create skipping categories 

 

4. 

The services identified in Resolution No. 1-S are particular kinds of services 
that can be reduced or eliminated pursuant to section 44955.  The County Superintendent’s 
decision to reduce or eliminate the identified services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, 
and was a proper exercise of her discretion.  Services will not be reduced below mandated 
levels.  Cause for the reduction or discontinuation of those particular services relates solely 
to the welfare of LACOE’s schools and pupils within the meaning of section 44949.  (Factual 
Findings 1-25.) 

                                                 
  
California (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 619, as modified (May 3, 2016). 

2 The Superior Court’s judgment was later reversed on appeal in Vergara v. State of 

 

8

5. 

Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees of LACOE due to 

the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services.  (Factual Findings 1-25.) 
 

6. 

During the hearing, LACOE rescinded the preliminary layoff notices issued to 
LaShonda Tillmon, Martin Navaroli, and Ella Dennen.  The District Statement of Reduction 
in Force will be dismissed as against them.  (Factual Finding 9.) 
 

7. 

No junior certificated employee is scheduled to be retained to perform services 
that a more senior employee is certificated and competent to render.  (Factual Findings 1-25.) 
 
 

ORDER 

 
 
The District Statement of Reduction in Force is dismissed as against LaShonda 
Tillmon, Martin Navaroli, and Ella Dennen.  LACOE shall not give them final layoff notices 
for the 2019-2020 school year. 
 
The District Statement of Reduction in Force is sustained against the remaining 
 
respondents.  LACOE may give a final notice of layoff to those respondents.  Notice shall be 
given to those respondents that their services will not be required for the 2019-2020 school 
year, and such notice shall be given in inverse order of seniority.
