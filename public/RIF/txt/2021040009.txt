FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1. 

Jill Falconer made and filed the District s Statement of Reduction in Force 

in her official capacity as the superintendent of the Lakeport Unified School District 

(District). 

 

2. 

On March 11, 2021, the Governing Board of the District adopted 

Resolution No. 03-21-02 (Resolution), reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of 

services for the 2021-2022 school year, and directing Superintendent Falconer to send 

appropriate notices to all employees whose positions may be affected by the 

reduction or discontinuation of services. 

 

3. 

The Resolution identified the services to be reduced by the 

commencement of the 2021-2022 school year as:

4. 

The services set forth in the Resolution are particular kinds of services 

that may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 

44955. Superintendent Falconer recommended the reduction of services because of 

declining enrollment. 

5. 

Pursuant to Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), when a 

governing board reduces particular kinds of services resulting in a decrease in the 

number of certificated, permanent employees, the services of a permanent employee 

may not be terminated if another employee with less seniority is retained to render a 

service that the more senior employee is  certificated and competent to render.

6. 

The seniority date of certificated employees is determined in accordance 

with Education Code section 44845, which provides:  Every probationary or permanent 

employee employed after June 30, 1947, shall be deemed to have been employed on 

the date upon which he first rendered paid service in a probationary position.   

7. 

Prior to March 15, 2021, Superintendent Falconer provided a written 

Notification of Recommendation That Your Services Will Not Be Required For The 

Ensuing School Year  (Preliminary Notice) to respondent Shelton Evans (respondent), a 

certificated employee of the District, notifying him that his services will not be required 

for the 2021-2022 school year, pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. 

8.

April 5, 2021, respondent was served with a Reduction in Force Packet, which included: 

a Statement to Respondent, the District Statement of Reduction in Force, copies of 

relevant Education and Government Code sections, a Notice of Participation, and a 

Notice of Hearing notifying respondent of the date and time set for hearing.  

9. 

Respondent did not return the Notice of Participation and did not appear 

at the hearing. This matter proceeded as a default pursuant to Government Code 

section 11520.

eliminate two of the courses currently taught by respondent. The remaining four 

courses will be assigned to a teacher with greater seniority who is credentialed to 

teach these courses. 

render.  

13.  No permanent or probationary certificated employee with less seniority is 

being retained to render a service which respondent is certificated and competent to

The District complied with all notice and jurisdictional requirements set 

forth in Education Code sections 44949 and 44955.  

2. 

The services referenced in the Resolution set forth in Factual Findings 2 

and 3 are the kind which may be reduced or discontinued in accordance with 

applicable statutes and case law. (See Ed. Code, ยง 44955; 

 (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796; 

(1976) 

64 Cal.App.3d 167.) The Board s decision to reduce or discontinue the services is 

neither arbitrary nor capricious, but rather a proper exercise of the District s discretion.  

3. 

The evidence established that no certificated employee with less seniority 

than respondent is being retained to render services which he is certificated and 

competent to perform. (Factual Findings 10-13.)  

4. 

In accordance with Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, cause 

exists for reduction of particular kinds of services by the District by the 

commencement of the 2021-2022 school year, as established in Factual Findings 2

through 9. The cause relates solely to the welfare of the District and its students, within 

the meaning of Education Code section 44949.

for the 2021-2022 school year.
