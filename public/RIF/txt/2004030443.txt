SUMMARY  OF  DECISION 

The  Governing  Board  of  the  Walnut  Valley  Union  School  District  (“District”) 

determined  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of  services  provided  by  teachers  and 
other  certificated  employees  for  budgetary  reasons,  totaling  57.05  full-time  equivalent 
positions.  The  decision  was  not  related  to  the  competency  and  dedication  of  the  individuals 
whose  services  are  proposed  to  be  reduced  or  eliminated. 

District  staff  carried  out  the  Board’s  decision  by  using  a  selection  process  involving 

review  of  credentials  and  seniority,  “bumping,”  “skipping,”  and  breaking  ties  between 
employees  with  the  same  first  dates  of  paid  service.  The  tie-breaking  process  was  objective 
and  in  good  faith.  The  selection  process  was  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the 
Education  Code. 

One  Respondent  is  entitled  to  a  seniority  date  one  day  earlier  and  thus  is  not  subject  to 

lay  off  because  not  enough  more  senior  employees  can  bump  her.  The  Precautionary 
Respondents  are  temporary  employees  not  entitled  to  hearing  rights  in  this  case  and  the 
Accusation  against  them  is  therefore  properly  dismissed.  The  disposition  of  the  remaining 
parties  is  as  requested  by  Complainant.

FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

2. 

3. 

l. 

Complainant  Bryan  Cole  is  the  Administrative  Director  -  Human  Resources, 
and  Designee  of  the  District  Superintendent  for  purposes  of  this  lay  off  process,  who  made 
and  filed  the  Accusation  in  his  official  capacity  as  such. 

Respondents  were  at  all  times  mentioned  certificated  District  employees. 

On  or  before  March  9,  2004,  Complainant,  as  Designee  of  the  Superintendent, 

recommended  to  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  (“Board”)  that  notice  be  given  to 
Respondents,  Precautionary  Respondents,  and  other  employees,  that  their  services  will  not  be 
required  for  the  next  school  year,  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955. 

4, 

On  March  9,  2004,  the  Board  adopted  Resolution  No.  04-24,  which  proposed  a 
lay  off  of  79.25  Full-Time  Equivalent  (FTE)  certificated  employees,  beginning  not  later  than 
the  commencement  of  the  2004-2005  school  year.’  The  Superintendent  was  directed  to  give 
notices  to  certificated  employees  that  their  services  would  not  be  required  next  school  year. 

  

" 

The  Board  later  decreased  to  57.05  the  number  of  FTE  positions  to  be  reduced.  See  Factual  Finding  15  below.

5A. 

 Onor  before  March  15,  2004,  and  after  notification  to  the  Board,  certificated 

employees,  including  Respondents  and  Precautionary  Respondents,  were  given  written 
notice  that  it  had  been  recommended,  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955, 
that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  next  school  year. 

5B. 

The  Precautionary  Respondents  were  given  notifications  relating  to  this  layoff 

proceeding,  as  a  precaution,  in  order  that  each  be  permitted  to  participate  and  exercise 
arguable  rights  to  this  hearing  process,  although  Complainant  asserted  then  (and  now)  that 
such  individuals  do  not  possess  any  such  rights  to  this  hearing  process  because  they  were 
temporary  certificated  employees.  Each  of  the  Precautionary  Respondents  was  also  released 
and  non-reelected,  pursuant  to  separate  Board  Resolutions,  based  upon  their  category  as 
temporary  employees. 

7. 

8. 

6. 

Pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44949,  Respondents  and  Precautionary 

Respondents,  in  writing,  requested  a  hearing  to  contest  whether  there  was  cause  for  not 
reemploying  them  next  school  year. 

After  adoption  of  Resolution  No.  04-24,  but  before  the  Accusation  was  filed, 

the  Board  considered  all  known  assured  attrition. 

Respondents  and  Precautionary  Respondents  timely  and  properly  filed  Notices 

of  Defenses,  which  requested  the  instant  hearing,  except  Precautionary  Respondent  Marie 
Thornberry,  who  by  failing  to  file  a  Notice  of  Defenses,  waived  her  right  to  contest  the 
Accusation.  Complainant  moved  to  dismiss  the  Accusation  against  her  due  to  that  default. 

9. 

Subsequently,  Respondent  Thomas  withdrew  her  Request  for  Hearing,  and  did 

not  appear  at  the  hearing.  Complainant  moved  to  dismiss  the  Accusation  against  her  due  to 
that  default. 

10. 

Subsequently,  Precautionary  Respondents  Liu,  Penzes,  and  Underwood  also 
withdrew  their  Requests  for  Hearing,  and  they  did  not  appear  at  the  hearing.  Complainant 
moved  to  dismiss  the  Accusation  against  them  due  to  their  defaults. 

11. 

At  the  hearing,  Complainant  moved  to  dismiss  the  Accusation  against 

Precautionary  Respondent  Galligani,  because  Complainant  no  longer  wants  to  treat  her  as  a 
Precautionary  Respondent  to  whom  notice  of  these  lay  off  proceedings  is  necessary,  as 
opposed  to  the  other  Precautionary  Respondents.  Complainant’s  counsel  stated  on  the  record 
that  because  she  was  also  given  notice  of  her  non-reelection  as  a  temporary  employee,  such 
action  did  not  necessarily  mean  she  would  be  retained  for  the  next  school  year. 

12. 

At  the  hearing,  Complainant,  without  objection,  withdrew  the  Accusations 

against  Respondents  Schroerlucke  and  Van  Dine,  because  the  District  decided  to  retain  their 
services  for  the  next  school  year.

Board  Resolution  No.  04-24  also  established  tie-breaking  criteria  to  determine 

the  relative  seniority  of  certificated  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  on  the  same 
date.  The  tie-breaking  criteria  established  by  the  District,  and  the  process  in  which  it  was 
implemented,  were  based  on  the  needs  of  the  District  and  its  students,  within  the  meaning  of 
Education  Code  section  44955(b),  and  were  not  arbitrary  or  capricious.

15. 

OnApril  28,  2004,  the  evening  before  the  hearing  of  this  matter,  the  Board 

adopted  Resolution  No.  04-27,  which  decreased  the  scope  of  the  particular  kinds  of  services 
(“PKS”)  and  respective  FTE  positions  to  be  reduced  in  prior  Board  Resolution  No.  04-24. 
That  modification  was  based  on  further  information  received  by  the  District,  such  as  receipt 
of  more  resignations,  retirements,  and  requests  for  leaves,  which  allowed  further 
consideration  of  educational  and  staffing  priorities  for  next  school  year.  The  modifications 
are  stated  below,  with  the  adjusted  PKS  and  FTE  positions  reflected  by  cross-outs,  as

The  District  maintains  a  Seniority  List  containing  employees’  seniority  dates, 

current  assignments  and  locations,  advanced  degrees,  credentials,  and  authorizations.  To 
assure  the  accuracy  of  seniority  dates  and  other  data,  certificated  employees  were  notified  in 
writing  of  the  District’s  records  regarding  their  first  dates  of  paid  service  and  credentials  in 
February  of  2003,  and  they  were  requested  to  either  confirm  or  challenge  the  accuracy  of  that 
information. 

17. 

The  District  used  that  Seniority  List  to  develop  a  proposed  lay  off  and 

"bumping"  list  of  the  least  senior  employees  currently  assigned  in  the  various  services  being 
reduced.  The  District  then  determined  whether  the  least  senior  employees  held  other 
credentials  entitling  them  to  "skip"  over  other  more  senior  employees.  In  determining  who 
would  be  subject  to  lay  off  for  each  kind  of  particular  service  reduced,  the  District  counted 
the  number  of  reductions  not  covered  by  the  known  vacancies,  and  determined  the  impact  on 
incumbent  staff  in  inverse  order  of  seniority. 

18. 

Considering  the  findings  and  conclusions  herein,  no  permanent  or 
probationary  certificated  employee  with  less  seniority  will  be  retained  to  render  a  service  that 
the  Respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

19. 

|  The  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  identified  particular  services 

above  was  neither  arbitrary  nor  capricious,  and  was  a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion. 

20. 

The  cause  for  reducing  and/or  eliminating  the  above-described  particular  kinds 

of  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  in  the  District  and  its  pupils. 

The  Precautionary  Respondents 

21. 

|  Each  Precautionary  Respondent  signed  a  temporary  employment  contract  and 

served  as  a  temporary  certificated  employee  at  all  times  mentioned.  Their  contracts  clearly  state 
"You  are  a  temporary  employee",  and  within  the  portion  for  acceptance  of  the  offer,  state  "I 
accept  the  above  offer  of  temporary  employment  ...".  The  contracts  each  cite  only  to  specific 
provisions  of  the  Education  Code  governing  temporary  employees.  No  evidence  indicated  there 
was  any  confusion  or  failure  on  their  part  to  understand  they  were  serving  the  District  as 
limited-term,  temporary  employees,  not  accruing  seniority  as  permanent  employees. 
Complainant  testified  the  District  tries  to  match  hired  temporary  employees  to  positions  left 
open  by  teachers  on  leave  or  otherwise  unavailable  to  teach  that  particular  school  year.  No 
evidence  indicated  any  temporary  contract  was  in  violation  of  the  Education  Code. 

22. 

Precautionary  Respondent  Tom  Inglima  signed  his  temporary  contract  with  the 
District  under  an  emergency  permit  to  teach.  He  teaches  Physical  Education.  During  service 
under  his  contract,  he  completed  his  coursework  for  a  regular  credential  and  the  District  was 
provided  a  C19  letter  from  his  university  so  indicating.  The  District  raised  his  pay  when  so 
notified,  to  give  him  the  benefit  of  the  fact  he  had  completed  his  coursework.  No  evidence 
indicated  the  Los  Angeles  County  Office  of  Education  or  the  District  had  been  notified  that

his  credentialing  status  had  yet  changed.  No  evidence  indicated  Mr.  Inglima  was  told,  or 
believed,  that  his  temporary  employee  status  with  the  District  changed.  The  fact  Mr.  Inglima 
received  the  C-19  letter  and  pay  raise  therefore  did  not  change  his  temporary  status. 

23. 

Precautionary  Respondent  Alvin  Graham  had  a  regular  teaching  credential 
when  he  signed  his  temporary  employment  contract  (Preliminary  Single  Subject  Physical 
Education).  He  teaches  PE  (60%)  and  Success  Through  Alternate  Resources  “STAR” 
(40%).  No  evidence  indicated  that  he  was  told  anything  by  the  District,  or  believed,  that  his 
regular  credential  changed  his  status  as  a  temporary  employee. 

Respondent  Landi 

24A. 

Respondent  Anna  Landi  was  first  employed  last  school  year  under  an 

emergency  permit  and  was  not  given  credit  for  that  year  in  her  seniority  date.  She  later 
obtained  her  regular  credential  and  returned  to  the  District  this  school  year  as  a  permanent 
employee.  The  District  gave  her  a  seniority  date  of  August  27,  2002,  which  is  one  day  later 
than  other  teachers,  new  to  the  District,  who  were  given  seniority  dates  of  August  26,  2002, 
because  they  reported  to  school  one  day  early  for  new  teacher  orientation.  Respondent  Landi 
contends  her  seniority  date  should  also  be  one  day  earlier,  since  as  a  returning  teacher  she 
was  not  required  to  attend  that  new  teacher  orientation.  The  earlier  seniority  date  would 
prevent  her  from  being  bumped  by  now  less  senior  employees,  and  thus  prevent  her  from 
being  subject  to  lay  off. 

24C. 

24B. 

According  to  Article  IV  of  the  Master  Contract  between  the  District  and  the 

Teachers  in  the  same  pay  grade,  whether  new  or  returning  teachers,  are  paid  an 

teachers’  union,  in  effect  at  the  times  in  question,  returning  teachers  have  a  184-day  contract, 
but  new  teachers  have  a  185-day  contract  because  they  are  required  to  report  one  day  earlier 
for  new  teacher  orientation.  As  a  returning  teacher  who  previously  completed  that 
orientation,  Respondent  Landi  was  not  required  to  attend  the  earlier  day  of  orientation.  No 
evidence  indicated  that  she  did. 

identical  annual  salary,  regardless  of  whether  they  reported  for  orientation  the  prior  day. 
Under  the  circumstances,  it  is  more  equitable  to  consider  August  26,  2002,  as  Respondent 
Landi’s  first  date  of  paid  service,  since  she  and  any  new  teacher  in  her  pay  grade  were  paid 
the  same  amount  during  this  school  year,  whether  or  not  they  reported  for  duty  the  prior  day. 
The  most  reasonable  view  of  this  situation  is  that  Respondent  Landi  essentially  had  a  paid 
day  of  leave  on  August  26,  2002,  in  which  her  absence  was  excused  because  she  had  already 
completed  the  orientation. 

   

anomaly,  where  new  teachers  to  the  District  are  given  greater  seniority  rights  over  returning 
teachers  (who  already  have  experience  with  the  District)  simply  because  the  new  teachers 
have  no  prior  experience  with  the  District.  No  fact  or  public  policy  is  apparent  that  would 
support  such  a  preference. 

Viewing  this  situation  otherwise  would  establish  an  unfair  and  irrational

399;  Santa  Clara  Federation  of  Teachers,  Local  2393  v.  Governing  Board  of Santa  Clara 
Unified  School  District  (1981)  116  Cal.App.3d  831. 

3. 

The  District  correctly  concluded  that  the  Precautionary  Respondents  were 

temporary  employees  not  entitled  to  hearing  rights  afforded  by  this  process. 

Individuals  serving  as  temporary  employees  are  not  entitled  to  the  rights 

within  Education  Code  section  44955.  The  procedures  instituted  by  the  District  in  hiring  the 
Precautionary  Respondents  as  temporary  employees  satisfied  the  requirements  set  forth  by 
the  California  Supreme  Court  in  Kavanaugh  v.  West  Sonoma  County  Union  High  School 
District  (2003)  29  Cal.4™  911,  918.  In  that  case,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  under 
Education  Code  Section  44916,  school  districts  may  classify  new  hires  as  temporary 
employees  if  they  (1)  notify  the  employee  of  his/her  salary  and  status  as  a  temporary 
employee;  (2)  do  so  in  a  written  notice;  and  (3)  give  such  notice  at  the  time  of  initial 
employment.  Since  these  requirements  were  met,  the  District  here  properly  classified  the 
Precautionary  Respondents  as  temporary  employees.  Respondents  presented  no  evidence  to 
the  contrary.  Factual  Findings  21-23. 

The  fact  the  Precautionary  Respondents  taught  under  regular  credentials  or 

emergency  permits  while  serving  their  temporary  contracts  does  not  alter  their  status  as 
temporary  employees  who  do  not  have  hearing  rights.  The  law  on  this  topic  is  clear.  “Time 
spent  teaching  under  an  emergency  teaching  credential  may  not  be  counted  in  computing  an 
employee’s  progress  toward  permanent  status,  unless  the  employee  is  credentialed  in  another 
state  and  demonstrates  adequate  basic  skills  proficiency  pending  successful  completion  of 
the  ...  CBEST.”  Summerfield  v.  Windsor  Unified  School  Dist.  (2002)  95  Cal.App.4th  1026, 
1028. 

The  case  of  California  Teachers  Assn.  v.  Governing  Bd.  of  Golden  Valley 

Unified  School  Dist.  (2002)  98  Cal.App.4th  369  provides  the  Precautionary  Respondents  no 
relief.  That  case  only  affirmed  a  school  district’s  ability  to  classify  an  employee  teaching 
under  an  emergency  permit  as  “probationary,”  and  that  if  so classified,  such  an  employee is 
entitled  to  the  protection  of  not  being  subject  to  a  mid-year  summary  termination.  Rather, 

10   

only  an  end  of  the  school  year  non-reelection  of  employment  can  terminate  them.  Jd.,  at 
383-384.  However,  the  court  specifically  limited  its  decision  to  that  relief,  and  affirmatively 
stated  teaching  under  an  emergency  permit  did  not  entitle  that  employee  to  credit  toward 
tenure,  citing  affirmatively  to  Summerfield.  Id.,  at  377. 

The  Precautionary  Respondents  erroneously  argue  their  temporary  contracts 
are  void  and  thus  they  should  be  re-classified  as  probationary  employees  instead,  citing  to 
Fine  v.  Los  Angeles  Unified  School  District  (2004)  116  Cal.App.4"  1070,  1077.  The  Fine 
court  did  hold  that  contract  terms  cannot  supercede  statutory  requirements  and  that  an 
employee  cannot  waive  rights  under  the  Education  Code  by  an  employment  contract  in 
violation  thereof.  Jd.  However,  there  was  no  evidence  in  this  case  that  any  of  the  temporary 
contracts  violated  the  Education  Code.  Complainant  established  that  temporary  employees 
are  generally  hired  to  fill  open  positions  due  to  leaves  of  absence  by  other  certificated 
employees.  Two  of  the  Precautionary  Respondents  were  hired  to  teach  P.E.  These  appear  to 
be  valid  reasons  to  classify  a  new  hire  as  a  temporary  employee.  No  evidence  was  presented 
showing  any  of  the  Precautionary  Respondents  were  hired  in  a  way  violating  the  Education 
Code,  or  that  their  classification  as  temporary  employees  was  improper  or  in  violation  of  that 
law.  Under  these  circumstances,  their  temporary  employee  contracts  control  and  establish 
they  are  not  entitled  to  re-classification  as  probationary  employees.  Factual  Findings  21-23. 

4. 

Under  the  Education  Code,  seniority  is  measured  from  the  first  date  on  which 
an  employee  rendered  paid  service.  Education  Code  sections  44845  and  87414.  According 
to  Education  Code  section  45028,  teachers  in  the  same  pay  grade  are  entitled  to  the  same 
annual  pay.  Because  Respondent  Landi  was  not  required  to  report  one  day  early  for  new 
teacher  orientation,  and  yet  was  paid  the  same  as  teachers  in  her  same  pay  grade  who  would 
have  been  required  to  report  early,  her  first  date  of  paid  service  should  be  viewed  as  the 
earlier  day  of  August  26,  2002.  No  authority  was  cited  indicating  that  the  Education  Code 
will  be  perverted  or  frustrated  by  this  outcome.  No  fact  or  law  was  presented  indicating  new 
teachers  to  the  District  should  be  given  preference  in  lay  off  cases  simply  because  they  report 
one  day  earlier  for  training  already  incurred  by  returning  teachers.  The  earlier  seniority  date 
prevents  her  from  being  bumped  out  of  a  position,  and  thus  Respondent  Landi  is  not  subject 
to  lay  off.  Factual  Finding  24. 

5. 

The  services  identified  in  Board  Resolution  No.  04-27  are  particular  kinds  of 

services  that  can  be  reduced  or  discontinued  under  Education  Code  section  44955.  The 
Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  identified  services  was  neither  arbitrary  nor 
capricious,  and  was  a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion.  Cause  for  the  reduction  or 
discontinuation  of  those  particular  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District’s  schools 
and  pupils  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44949,  Factual  Findings  1-24. 

6. 

Cause  exists  to  reduce  the  number  of  certificated  employees  of  the  District  due 

to  the  reduction  and  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services.  Factual  Findings  1-24. 

7. 

No  junior  certificated  employee  is  scheduled  to  be  retained  to  perform  services 
which  a  more  senior  employee  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render.  Factual  Findings  1-24.
