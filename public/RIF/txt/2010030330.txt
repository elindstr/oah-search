Total Full-Time Equivalent Reduction  =     52.4  F.T.E. 

 
 
 
 
The reason for the Board’s resolution is a projected reduced budget for the 
 
2010-2011 school year.  Judy Durand, Executive Director of Human Resources, credibly 
testified that the District’s continuing budgetary concerns compelled the decision to reduce 
services for the 2010-2011 school year.  The decision to reduce or discontinue the identified 
services was not arbitrary or capricious.

On March 11, 2010, the Superintendent gave written notice to certificated 

Prior to the hearing, the District, following settlement negotiations, rescinded 

 
 
employees in 52.4 F.T.E. positions that it had been recommended that notice be given them 
that their services would not be required for the 2010-2011 school year.  Many of the noticed 
employees, including Respondent, filed timely requests for hearing, and an Accusation was 
filed and served.  Many of the employees, including Respondent, filed timely notices of

employees signed, in order to pursue her right to due process of law.  Further, Respondent 
asserts that the elimination of her position will result in the failure to provide the subject 
matter she teaches to students, a result that will not serve the District or its students.   
 
 
District, but the District is required to operate in a fiscally sound manner.  There will always 
be disagreements concerning which programs to cut and how extensive the cuts should be, 
but the Board is duty-bound to make these difficult decisions.  Without fiscal integrity, the 
District cannot adequately serve its schools or its pupils.  In these circumstances and in the 
absence of a showing that the District acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner, it is 
necessarily concluded that the service reductions, including of Respondent’s undoubtedly 
very valuable position, are related to the welfare of the District’s schools and its pupils.
