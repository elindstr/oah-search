FACTUAL  FINDINGS  AND  DISCUSSION 

1. 

Kelley  Staley  is  the  Superintendent  of  the  Chico  Unified  School  District 

(District).  Her  actions  and  the  actions  of  the  District  Governing  Board  were  taken  in  their 
official  capacities. 

e 

2. 

Respondents  are  permanent  or  probationary  certificated  employees  of  the 

District.  On  March  13,  2008,  the  District  served  on  each  respondent  a  written  notice  that  it 
had  been  recommended  that  notice  be  given  to  respondents  pursuant  to  Education  Code 
sections  44949  and  44955  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or  would  not  be  required  for 

  

 

  

  

the  2008-2009  school  year.  Each  written  notice  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation 
and  noted  that  the  District  Governing  Board  had  passed  a  Resolution  reducing  the 
certificated  staff  by  221.0055  full-time  equivalent  (FTE)  positions.  Respondents  timely 
requested  in  writing  a  hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the 
ensuing  school  year. 

e@ 

3. 

The  Superintendent  made  and  filed  Accusations  against  respondents.  The 
Accusations  with  required  accompanying  documents  and  blank  Notices  of  Defense  were 
timely  served  on  respondents. 

4. 

On  February  20,  2008,  The  District  Governing  Board  adopted  Resolution  No. 
1011-08  and  Resolution  No.  1013-08;  and  on  March  5,  2008,  adopted  Resolution  No.  1014- 
08.  The  District  Governing  Board  directed  the  Superintendent  to  give  notice  to  affected 
certificated  employees  that  their  services  would  be  reduced  or  not  required  for  the  next 
school  year  and  stating  the  reasons  for  that  recommendation. 

5. 

On  February  20,  2008,  the  District  Governing  Board  determined  that  it  was 
necessary  to  decrease  programs  and  services  and  thus  it  was  necessary  to  reduce  teaching 
services  affecting  employment  of  221.005-FTE  positions.  The  District  Governing  Board 
adopted  Resolution  No.  1011-08  providing  for  the  reduction  or  elimination  of  the  following 
particular  kinds  of  services  (PKS):

6. 

The  Superintendent  caused  each  of  the  employees  identified  in 

ATTACHMENT A to  this  Decision  to  be  served  with  a  written  Notice  of  Intention  to 
Dismiss  (preliminary  notice)  on  or  before  March  15,  2008.  The  written  preliminary  notices 
advised  respondents  of  the  Superintendent’s  recommendation  to  the  Board  that  their  services 
would  not  be  required  for  the  upcoming  school  year.  The  preliminary  notice  set  forth  the 
reasons  for  the  recommendation  and  for  the  reductions  and  eliminations  of  the  particular 
kinds  of  services. 

7. 

The  employees  identified  by  name  in  ATTACHMENT B to  this  Decision  each 

timely  filed  a  written  Request  for  Hearing  to  determine  if  there  was  cause  for  not 
reemploying  them  for  the  ensuing  year. 

 
  

8. 

The  District  timely  served  Accusations  on  each  respondent  who  timely  filed  a 
Request  for  Hearing.  Along  with  being  served  the  Accusation,  each  respondent  also received 
a  copy  of  the  Board’s  Resolution  and  a  copy  of  the  detail  identifying  each  particular  kind  of 
service  slated  by  the  District  for  reduction  or  elimination. 

9. 

Each  respondent  identified  in  ATTACHMENT C to  this  Decision  timely  filed 

a  Notice  of  Defense  to  the  Accusation,  either  in  person  or  through  counsel. 

10. 

All  respondents  who  appeared  at  the  time  of  hearing  were  represented  by 

counsel.  No  appearing  respondent  indicated  that  he  or  she  was  not  represented. 

Employees  in  Categorically  Funded  Programs 

11. 

Of  the  221.0055  FTE  positions  slated  for  reduction,  47  relate  to  categorically 

funded  programs.  Respondents  contend  that  each  employee  listed  as  teaching  in  a 
categorically  funded  position,  as  well  as  employees  filling  in  for  tenured  teachers  moved  to 
categorically  funded  positions,  are  entitled  to  participate  in  the  layoff  process,  to  be  given  a 
seniority  date  and  to  be  afforded  rehire  rights.  (Ed.  Code,  §§  44949,  44955  and  44957.)  The 
District  believes  these  teachers  should  be  classified  as  temporary  employees  subject  to 
release  under  Education  Code  section  44954.  The  District  served  respondents  in  this 
category  with  “precautionary”  layoff  notices. 

Education  Code  section  44909  addresses  the  47  categorically  funded  FTE  situation. 
It  relates  to  employment  of  certificated  employees  in  categorically  funded  programs  which 
are  not  required  by  federal  or  state  statutes.  Section  44909  provides:  “Such  persons  may  be 
employed  for  periods  which  are  less  than  a  full  school  year  and  may  be  terminated  at  the 
expiration  of  the  contract  or  specially  funded  project  without  regard  to  other  requirements  of 
this  code  respecting  the  termination  of probationary  or  permanent  employees  other  than 
Section  44918.”  [Emphasis  added.] 

12. 

Bakersfield  Elementary  Teachers  Association,  CTA/NEA  v.  Bakersfield  City 

School  District  (2006)  145  Cal.App.4th  1260  is  also  instructive.  The  Bakersfield  court 
considered  the  rights  of  19  employees  hired  under  Education  Code  section  44909  and 
classified  as  temporary,  and  determined  that  such  classification  was  erroneous.  Although 
such  employees  are  “treated  like”  temporary  employees  in  certain  respects  (i.e.,  not  crediting 
service  toward  permanent  classification)  they  are  presumptively  probationary  employees  and 
entitled  to  notice  and  a  hearing  in  the  event  of  layoff  under  Education  Code  sections  44949 
and  44955.  (Id.  at  pp.  1285-1287.)  However,  the  Bakersfield  court  also  pointed  out  that 
these  employees  are  not  entitled  to  these  due  process  layoff  protections  if  the  categorical 
program  had  expired.  (Jd.  at  p.  1287.)  In  apparent  reliance  upon  the  language  of  Education 
Code  section  44909,  the  Fifth  District  Court  of  Appeal  explained: 

Thus,  certificated  teachers  assigned  to  a  categorically  funded 
program  may  be  laid  off  without  the  procedural  formalities  due 
a  permanent  and  probationary  employee  only  if  the  program  has 

  

 

  

expired.  (Hart  Federation  of  Teachers,  supra,  73  Cal.App.3d  at 
pp.  215-216;  Zalac,  supra,  98  Cal.App.4th  at  p.  852.)  Here,  so 
far  as  the  record  discloses,  none  of  the  programs  to  which  the  19 
laid-off  employees  were  assigned  had  expired.  ! 

@ 

13. 

In  this  case,  the  District  Governing  Board  adopted a  resolution  that  specifically 

identified  47  FTE  of  categorically  funded  programs  for  reduction/elimination.  Thus,  the 
positions  have  been  assigned 
categorical  programs  to  which  certificated  teachers  in  47  FTE 
are  slated  to  expire  as  a  result  of  the  Board’s  actions  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code 
section  44909,  As  a  result,  respondent  teachers  listed  as  teaching  in  these  categorically 
funded  positions,  as  well  as  respondent  teachers  filling  in  for  tenured  teachers  moved  to 
categorically  funded  positions,  are  not  entitled  to  participate  in  this  layoff  process. 

These  determinations  notwithstanding,  should  the  categorically  funded  programs  be 

resumed  next  year,  respondents  placed  in  those  categorically  funded  services  have  not 
waived  any  argument  that  they  may  wish  to  assert  at  that  time  that  their  status  should  be  that 
of  probationary  employees.

20. 

The  parties  stipulated  and  agreed  to  the  above  matters,  and  requested  that  a 

Decision  and  Order  as  set  forth  here  be  entered,  without  the  need  for  further  evidentiary 
hearing.  In  doing  so,  the  parties  by  implication  agree  that: 

Each  respondent  is  the  proper  subject  of  receipt  of  a  preliminary  notice  of 

a. 
layoff,  except  as  otherwise  set  forth  in  this  Decision; 

b. 

Factual  and  legal  cause  exists  to  lay  off  each  respondent,  except  as  set  forth  in 

this  Decision;  and 

Each  respondent,  except  as  otherwise  set  forth  in  this  Decision,  waives  and 

c. 
relinquishes  his  or  her  right  to  an  evidentiary  hearing  as  set  forth  in  Education  Code 
sections  44949  and  44955,  and  Government  Code  section  11500,  et.seq. 

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  for  the  evidentiary  hearing  and  the 

d. 
layoff  process  were  met. 

Each  of  the  parties  freely  and  voluntarily  entered  into  the  stipulation,  and  each 
e. 
thereupon  waived  the  right  to  any  additional  evidentiary  hearing  on  any  of  the  matters 
raised  by  this  action. 

21. 

|  With  due  consideration  and  adjustments  made  for  the  matters  noted  above,  no 
permanent  or  probationary  certificated  employees  junior  to  respondents  are  being  retained  to 
perform  a  service  which  respondents  are  certificated  and  competent  to  render.  Those 
certificated  employees  junior  to  respondents  being  retained  will  provide  services  which 
respondents  are  not  certificated  and  competent  to  perform. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949 

and  44955.  All  notices  and  jurisdictional  prerequisites  required  by  those  sections  were 
satisfied.  The  District  has  the  burden  of  proving  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  the 
proposed  reduction  or  elimination  of  particular  kinds  of  services  and  the  preliminary  notices 
of  layoff  served  on  respondents  is  factually  and  legally  appropriate.  (Ed.  Code,  §§  444949 
and  44955.) 

2. 

The  services  the  District  seeks  to  eliminate  in  this  matter,  as  set  forth  in 

Resolution  No.  1011-08,  are  “particular  kinds  of  services”  that  may  be  reduced  or 
discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section  44955.  Legal  cause  exists 
pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  Chico  Unified  School  District 
to  reduce  or  discontinue  221.0055  FTE  of  particular  kinds  of  services,  as  set  forth  in  the 
District’s  Resolution  and  identified  in  the  Factual  Findings.  The  reduction  or  discontinuation 
of  these  identified  particular  kinds  of  services  relates  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  District  and 
its  pupils. 

  

16

  

3. 

Legal  cause  exists  pursuant  to  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  to 

give  respondents  identified  in  Paragraph  19  of  the  Factual  Findings  final  notice  that  their 
services  will  not  be  required  for  school  year  2008/2009.  Legal  cause  exists  to  sustain  the 
Accusations.  The  Board  may  give  the  Paragraph  19  respondents  final  notices  that  their 
services  will  not  be  required  by  the  District  in  the  upcoming  school  year,  in  inverse  order  of 
seniority. 

ORDER 

1. 

°  The  Chico  Unified  School  District  action  to  reduce  or  eliminate  221.0055  FTE 

of  particular  kinds  of  services  for  the  2008/2009  school  year  is  AFFIRMED. 

2. 

The  Accusations  with  respect  to  those  respondent  certificated  employees  of  the 

Chico  Unified  School  District  identified  in  paragraph  15  of  the  Factual  Findings  above  are 
DISMISSED. 

3. 

The  certificated  employees  identified  in  paragraph  18  shall  have  their  status 

changed  from  that  of  temporary  to  probationary  teachers. 

4. 

The  Accusations  with  respect  to  those  respondent  certificated  employees  of  the 

Chico  Unified  School  District  identified  in  paragraph  19  of  the  Factual  Findings  above  are 
SUSTAINED.  Final  notice  may  be  given  to  the  paragraph  19  identified  respondents  by  the 
District  that  their  services  will  not  be  required  for  the  upcoming  school  year.  Notice  shall  be 
given  in  inverse  order  of  seniority.
