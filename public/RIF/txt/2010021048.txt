8. 

9. 

 
 
The Governing Board by Resolution No. 35:09/10 dated March 11, 2010, has 
 
further determined that, as between employees who first rendered paid service on the same 
date, the order of termination listed on the seniority list has been based solely on the basis of 
the needs of the District and the students thereof.   
 

10. 

The Governing Board cannot reduce two middle school counselors .5 FTE 
each.  The reduction must be in a particular kind of service, a particular position.  Vivian 
Garlick is the senior counselor.  She must be allowed to retain her full 1.0 FTE.  The junior

12. 

Talia Stamos and Shannon Lynch were given notice based on the reduction of 

counselor, Julie Jobak, can be reduced .5 FTE and only .5 FTE since that was what was 
called for in the resolution3 and that is what was called for in her notice. 
 
 
services of K – 4 self contained classroom teachers.4  The District claimed that they were 
being bumped.  However, Ms. Stamos and Ms. Lynch are not K – 4 classroom teachers5 and 
the District could not identify any senior teacher(s) that were bumping into their positions.  
Ms. Stamos and Ms. Lynch cannot be given a final layoff notice.   
 

13. 

Julie Fox retains her .20 FTE in computers.  There is no resolution to reduce or 

discontinue that service.  Ms. Fox may have other issues concerning tie breaking that do not 
affect this layoff hearing.  She can be given notice for .80 FTE. 

 
14.  Other than as set forth above, no permanent or probationary certificated 
employee with less seniority is being retained to render a service, which the respondents, or 
any of them, are certificated and competent to render. 
 
 
schools in the District and the pupils thereof. 
 
 

The cause for not reemploying respondents relates solely to the welfare of the

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Cause for the termination or reduction of the particular kinds of service listed 

 
 
in Finding 7 and the corresponding positions exists in accordance with Education Code 
sections 44949 and 44955.  It is determined that the cause relates solely to the welfare of the 
schools and their pupils. 
 
 
Governing Board can determine the order of termination for employees who first rendered 
paid service to the district on the same date.  It has done so. 
 

Pursuant to Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), only the 

2

Except as set forth in the Factual Findings above, notice shall be given in 

inverse order of seniority.  

                                                 

3 The other “Services to be Reduced” are not the subject of this hearing since none of a affected employees 

requested a hearing. 
 
4 Anne Stephanos is in the same position as Ms. Stamos and Ms. Lynch, but she did not request a hearing 

and therefore her situation is not addressed in the proposed decision. 

  
5 They each teach a core middle school class.
