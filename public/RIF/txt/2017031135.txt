FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

The District serves more than 130,000 students in pre-school through grade 12 

and is the second largest district in California.  The student population is extremely diverse, 
representing more than 15 ethnic groups and more than 60 languages and dialects.  The 
District has more than 226 educational facilities with 13,559 employees. Nearly 6,000
teachers are in classrooms at the district’s various educational facilities, which include 

 

1

117 traditional elementary schools, 9 K-8 schools, 25 traditional middle schools, 24 high 
schools, 49 charter schools, and 14 atypical/alternative schools.

2.

For the 2017-2018 school year, the District is facing a projected budget deficit 
of $124.4 million.  On February 28, 2017, in an effort to bridge the projected budget deficit, 
the Board of Education (Board) of the District adopted Resolution No. H-1 “in order to 
reduce or eliminate services and permit the layoff of certificated employees.” 

Pursuant to the Resolution, the Board determined that it was necessary for the District 

to reduce or eliminate certain particular kinds of services (PKS) and to decrease a 
corresponding number of certificated district employees not later than the beginning of the 
2017-2018 school year.  In the Resolution, the Board directed the Superintendent to send 
notices to all employees affected by the PKS reductions or eliminations.  The Board also 
directed the Superintendent, or her designee, to make assignments and reassignments of 
certificated employees following implementation of the PKS reductions or eliminations to 
ensure that each remaining certificated employee is assigned to a position for which he or she 
is properly credentialed pursuant to Education Code section 44955.1

Preliminary and Precautionary Layoff Notices

4.

On March 6, 2017, pursuant to the Resolution, Timothy Asfazadour, Chief 

Human Resources Officer, sent preliminary layoff notices to the certificated employees 
identified for layoff.  The District sent 87 precautionary notices to teachers whom the District 
identified as meeting the “skipping” criteria pursuant to Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), so 
that, in the event the proposed skips are found not to satisfy the requirements of that 
subdivision, the District could layoff the teachers who had been proposed to be skipped.  A
copy of the resolution and information concerning the right to request a hearing were 
enclosed with the preliminary layoff notices. 

5.

In response to the preliminary layoff notices, 287 permanent certificated 

persons submitted hearing requests.  These persons are identified in Appendix C. 

On March 27, 2017, Cindy Marten, District Superintendent, served the employees 

who requested a hearing with the District Statement of Reduction in Force including Notice 
of Hearing, List of Respondents in alphabetical order, and Board Resolution including the 
PKS List and Tie Breaking criteria.  

Stipulation Regarding Withdrawal of Layoff Notices 

6.

By stipulation of the parties, the District withdrew the layoff notices served on 

respondents Michael S. Desjardins, Jacinda L. Dietz, Kristin Ann Dove, Kelsey Lynn 
Jenkins, Mary Reynolds Kirchgestner, Celestina Alejandra Kuncz, Jennifer R. Peterson, Teri 
Lyn Rosinski, Randy S. Tsuchuyima, and Katherine Lynn Wagner.  

District’s Intention to Deviate From Seniority (Skipping)and Testimony of Angela Houston 
Regarding the District’s Need for the Skipping Categories and Criteria

7.

The seniority rule is not absolute, and a junior teacher with a needed credential 

or skills may be retained even if a more senior teacher is terminated so long as no senior 
teacher possesses the special training and experience necessary to provide the service.  Both 
statute and case law recognize “skipping.”  (Ed. Code § 44955, subd. (d)(1); Bledsoe v. Biggs 
Unified School District (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 127; Santa Clara Federation of Teachers, 
Local 2393 v. Governing Board of the Santa Clara Unified School District (1981) 116 
Cal.App.3d 831.) 

Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), authorizes a district to deviate from terminating 

certificated employees in order of seniority if: 

The district demonstrates a specific need for personnel to teach 
a specific course of study, or provide services authorized by a 
services credential with a specialization in either pupil personnel 
services or health for a school nurse, and that the certificated 
employee has special training and experience necessary to teach

4

that course or course of study or to provide those services, 
which others with more seniority do not possess.  

8.

The Board in executive session approved the following “Deviation from 

Seniority (“Skipping”)” (skip) criteria:

That in selecting those permanent certificated employees who 
shall receive notice of termination pursuant to Resolution, 
Education Code section 44955 allows the Governing Board to 
deviate from terminating a certificated employee in order of 
seniority by virtue of their competence, credential(s), 
assignment, and the specific needs of the District and its 
students.  The Superintendent or designee may deviate from 
seniority order in order to retain certain certificated employees 
in specific programs, courses, or courses of study, based on 
special training and experience.  These areas shall include: 

1. Special Training and experience in an assignment requiring 

a Bilingual Certificate of Competence (BCLAD) in 
Mandarin Chinese, French, or Spanish and teaching 
experience in that language immersion program during the 
2016-2017 school year in order to serve the student 
populations in the language immersion school programs in 
Mandarin Chinese, French or Spanish for the 2017-2018 
school years. 

2. Special training and experience in an assignment requiring 
International Baccalaureate (IB) Program curriculum in 
2016-2017 and assigned to teach in an assignment requiring 
IB curriculum in the 2017-2018 school year in order to serve 
the student population at IB school sites. 

3. Special training and experience obtained in a Transitional 

Kindergarten assignment in the 2016-2017 school year and a 
signed Affidavit to Teach Transitional Kindergarten in order 
to serve the student population at school sites with 
Transitional Kindergarten courses in the 2017-2018 school 
year.  

9.

The Affidavit that is referenced under the transitional kindergarten (TK) skip 

category states that the teacher is credentialed and meets one or more of the following 
requirements for a TK assignment at the District:

• Completed at least 24 units in Early Childhood Education 

(ECE), Child Development, or both; 

5

• Holds a Child Development Teacher permit issued by the 

California Commission on Teacher Credentialing; 

• Taught at least 75% of an instructional year in Kindergarten and 
agree to attend three (3) SDUSD Transitional Kindergarten 
development trainings by August 2020; and 

• Taught Kindergarten for at least five (5) years prior to this 

assignment; 

• Taught Transitional Kindergarten in 2015-2016 and agree to 

attend three (3) SDUSD Transitional Kindergarten development 
trainings by August 2020.  

This affidavit was prepared, apparently, in relation to a “Side Letter Agreement” 

between the District and the San Diego Education Association (SDEA) dated October 22, 
2015.  These parties entered into this Side Letter Agreement in order to ensure that 
“credentialed teachers who are first assigned to a [TK] classroom after July 1, 2015, have by 
August 1, 2020,” one of the criteria addressed in the affidavit.  

Angela Houston is Director of Human Resources.  As a result of the anticipated 

budget deficit, she worked with a team of support staff to determine which teachers would 
receive layoff notices.  She accounted for attrition and considered assigned and unassigned 
teachers, teachers on leaves of absence, and probationary teachers.  Ms. Houston noted that 
probationary employees do not have the right to contest their proposed termination through 
this hearing process but may contest their proposed termination through a separate grievance 
process.    

Working with her support team, Ms. Houston developed an updated and accurate 
seniority list that accurately reflects the seniority dates and certifications of teachers.  She 
verified credentialing information and corrected errors; with her team, she applied tie-
breaking criteria as set forth in the Resolution.  From the seniority list, the District sent 960 
notices; with 404 of these notices going to permanent teachers.  Staff kept track of which 
teachers requested hearings.  A list of teachers who requested hearings was received into 
evidence.  

Ms. Houston addressed why the District needed to create the three skip instruction 

categories.  She testified that the criteria for dual immersion (DI) instruction were developed 
with the instructional team.  The District, she said, has had “a very hard time” finding 
persons who have BCLAD, can teach, and have multi-subject credentials.  The BCLAD, she 
added, attaches typically to multi-subject credentials.  She stated that it is one thing to teach 
an English learner, but dual language requires teaching in a foreign language and requires 
teaching experience.  

6

She testified that the criteria for the IB program had been used in past layoff actions, 

and applies only to core teachers, teachers in the areas of math, science, English, social 
science, and language, as opposed to non-classroom teachers.  She noted that the criteria 
include a requirement that teachers be assigned to teach in the IB program next year.  This 
category applies only to those IB courses that will lead to an IB diploma.  She is aware that 
IB schools require that teachers be IB trained, and in order to offer IB diplomas, a school 
must be certified as an IB school.  

Regarding the 3rd category, the TK program, Ms. Houston testified that, due to a 

change in the law, the District has had difficulty getting qualified TK teachers who meet the 
criteria under Section 48000.2  The District posted positions for TK teachers that were not 
filled and had to hire from the outside.  The District, she said, is trying to “build in” some 
requirements under the law.  She noted that many people are not graduating with child 
development credentials or multi-subject credentials.  The District imposed the requirement 
for the affidavit in conjunction with the side letter agreement in order to determine who 
would be able to teach TK.  She said that this affidavit was transmitted to staff through a 
circular that goes to everyone in the District.  She added that principals make assignments to 
TK.  

Challenge to the Competency Criteria in the Skipping Categories

10.

Certain respondents argued that the competency criteria for all three categories 
of instruction are too narrow and based, in part, on the teachers’ current teaching assignments 
– and regarding IB, based on both current and future assignments, rather than any specialized 
training or experience.  Respondents argued that, consequently, the proposed skipping is 
impermissible because it focuses on something other than the special training and experience 
necessary to provide the services.  In support of their argument, these respondents principally 
rely on the decision in Duax v. Kern Community College District (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 
555, 565, and administrative decisions that were marked as argument.3    

In Duax, the court affirmed the trial court’s decision to deny petitions filed by three 

appellants, including a teacher noticed for layoff who had been employed at Bakersfield 
College as a clinical psychologist for the preceding 25 years.  The community college district 
planned to retain a junior teacher to teach psychology the ensuing school year based on 
competency standards the district’s board of trustees adopted that required one year’s full-

 

 

2 Section 48000 requires that TK be part of a school’s kindergarten program and that, 

after July 1, 2015, and by August 1, 2020, TK teachers must have either at least 24 units in 
early childhood education, or childhood development, or both; professional experience in a 
classroom setting with preschool children comparable to 24 units of education; or a 
childhood development permit issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.  TK 
means the first year of a two-year kindergarten program that uses a modified kindergarten 
curriculum that is age and developmentally appropriate.

3 The Duax court interpreted Section 87743, the community college analog to Section 

44955.  

7

time teaching in the subject area within the past ten years.  (Id. at p 564.)   The clinical 
psychologist had not taught since 1960, and the district considered him not competent to 
teach psychology.  Thus, he was deemed not competent to bump a junior teacher being 
retained to teach psychology.  (Id. at p. 564.)   

In affirming the trial court’s decision to deny the psychologist’s petition for a writ of 

mandate, the court analyzed whether the board’s competency standards were “reasonable and 
valid.”  (Ibid.)  The court stated that a board’s definition of competency is reasonable when it 
considers the skills and qualifications of the teacher threatened with layoff.  (Id. at p 565, 
citing Martin v. Kenfield School Dist. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 294, 297.)  In its analysis, the court
did not articulate a bright line test to determine when a competency standard is “reasonable 
and valid.”  The court found that the standard of competency that required one year’s full-
time teaching in the subject area within the past ten years clearly related to skills and 
qualifications to teach and was thus reasonable and valid.  (Id. at p. 567.)   

For their position that the competency standards in this matter are not reasonable 

respondents find support in the Duax court’s following commentary: 

That standard was established by resolution of the governing 
board, and since it requires only one year of teaching in the last 
ten, not one in the last two or three, we are not persuaded that it 
too narrowly defines competency. (Id. at p. 567.) 

Here, the issue to be determined is whether the competency criteria are reasonable in 

implementing the requirements of section 44955, subdivision (d)(1).  That subdivision 
requires that the focus be on whether a more senior teacher possesses special training and 
experience necessary to provide the service. This requires a fact specific analysis.  

The District, in its response, stressed the District’s broad discretion to reduce or 
eliminate particular kinds of services absent fraud or actions that were arbitrary or capricious, 
consistent with applicable case law.   

The International Baccalaureate Program

11.

The IB program consists of three cluster programs: elementary, middle school 

and high school, where students graduate with an IB diploma.  This diploma is recognized 
worldwide.  The District’s mission is to ensure the quality of the IB program.  Students 
receive instruction in these subject areas: Language Acquisition, Language and Literature, 
Individuals and Societies, Mathematics, Design, Arts, Sciences, and Physical and Health 
Education.  All subject areas are valued equally.  All educators in the District’s IB Program 
are IB educators.   

The District’s IB program is certified by a governing association, the International 

Baccalaureate Governing Organization, which sets standards an IB program must meet.  The 
certification program occurs every five years; the most recent time this process occurred was 
in 2014.  

8

The District demonstrated a specific need for personnel to teach in the IB program.

12.

The District proposes to skip certain teachers who teach in the IB program.  

No teacher with more seniority came forward to claim that he or she possessed special 
training or experience necessary to teach the courses the skipped teachers are being retained 
to teach.

Various witnesses provided extensive testimony that certain teachers who teach either 
physical education or music should be skipped to teach in the IB program.  For two reasons, 
that proposition is rejected.  First, the District established that the IB program consists of 
eight subject areas, and physical education and music are not included.  Second, a teacher has 
no right to be skipped.  A school district may choose to skip certain teachers but not others.  
Regardless of the wisdom of such a decision, the District’s decision in this regard is owed 
deference because no evidence was offered that it was the result of fraud or was arbitrary or 
capricious.  (Campbell Elementary Teachers Association v. Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 
796, 808.)  

Testimony Regarding the Dual Language Immersion Program

13.

Nuri Vargas teaches in the dual immersion language program at Juarez 
Elementary and was identified by the District as part of the DI skip.  She holds a clear 
Multiple Subject, General Subjects, and Single Subject: Foreign Language-Spanish 
credentials, and she has a BCLAD.  Ms. Vargas has a seniority date of August 27, 2014.  She 
has taught at Juarez for the past three years and before teaching at Juarez taught at a charter 
school for eight years  

DI is different than a foreign language elective course.  Students in DI classes study 

and learn in both Spanish, or another language, and English.  Some of the students are 
Spanish-speaking, some are native English-speaking.  The program is designed to build 
fluency in both Spanish and English and seeks to promote bilingualism, biliteracy, academic 
achievement and multicultural awareness.  Ms. Vargas teaches in Spanish while her partner 
teaches in English.  

Due to limited materials available for DI instruction, Ms. Vargas developed her own 
instructional materials.  Ms. Vargas developed curriculum based on applicable standards and
translated District programs for reading and writing.  When she started at Juarez, she created 
worksheets, prepared posters, prepared lessons, and translated curricula into Spanish.

 
Ms. Vargas read a letter of support from the principal at Juarez.  The principal
described Ms. Vargas as an integral part of the DI program, a mentor to other teachers, and 
an advocate for her students.  Without Ms. Vargas, the program would lose continuity, and 
her loss would be detrimental to the school.   

14.

Denise Bennett-Paquin holds preliminary General Subjects and Multiple 
Subject Teaching credentials.  Since last summer she has held a BCLAD.  Ms. Bennett-

9

Paquin teaches at the Language Academy, and the District identified her as part of the DI 
skip.  She has a seniority date of August 26, 2014. 

Ms. Bennett-Paquin has been involved in teaching in dual immersion since 1999 in 

programs outside California.  She came to the school to teach in the DI program.  To support 
her work in French language dual immersion, the San Diego Office of Education supported 
her with a grant.  She teaches all subjects in French, and due to the lack of materials, she had 
to innovate and develop curriculum materials in French.  She spent a lot of time developing 
these materials.  

15. Monique Clifford teaches transitional kindergarten and kindergarten at the 
Language Academy and has a seniority date of August 28, 2013.  She holds clear General 
Subjects/Elementary, Multiple Subject Teaching, and French Language credentials.  The 
District identified her as a skip in both the DI and Transitional Kindergarten (TK) categories.  

Ms. Clifford explained that DI promotes bi-literacy and cross cultural competence; 

promotes the value of both languages.  She articulated the following goals of DI: Developing 
Bilingual; Two-Way Immersion; Heritage Language Immersion and Foreign Language 
Immersion.  

No teacher with more seniority came forward to claim that he or she possessed special 

training or experience necessary to teach DI in French which the skipped teachers, Ms. 
Bennett-Paquin and Ms. Clifford, are being retained to teach. 

16.

Linda Guerra-Adame teaches bilingual education at Rosa Parks Elementary.  

She holds Clear Bilingual Spanish, Multiple Subjects/Elementary, and Multiple Subject 
Teaching credentials.  She also holds a BCLAD.  In addition, she holds a Masters of Arts 
Degree in Education, and San Diego State University’s College of Education, Department of 
Dual Language and English Learner Education, recognized her completion of the degree in 
this program.  Ms. Guerra-Adame has a seniority date of September 13, 2013.  Ms. Guerra-
Adame served as a substitute teacher for eight years in San Ysidro, South Bay, Chula Vista, 
and San Diego.  As a substitute teacher, she had long-term assignments up to 6 months.   
Given her training and experience, she felt there is no reason she cannot teach in the DI 
program.   

17.

Laura Varela is a Spanish bilingual education teacher at Audubon K to 8 

School.  She holds clear General Subjects/Elementary and Multiple Subject Teaching 
credentials.  Ms. Varela holds a BCLAD.  She has a seniority date of August 26, 2014.  

Ms. Varela believes that she is qualified to teach DI classes.  Ms. Varela testified that 

she has been a visiting teacher for the District in dual immersion classes at Sherman 
Elementary and at the Language Academy.  In these classes, she used the lesson plans left by 
the teachers, and she also created charts for students.  In her bi-literacy class she uses the 
exact same materials used in DI classes and the instruction is the same instruction provided 
in DI classes.  Ms. Varela also has received District offered trainings in bi-literacy and DI 
education which were trainings DI teachers attended.  Ms. Varela presented four Certificates 

10

of Completion for completion of “OLA-Dual/Biliteracy Professional Development” for 
trainings she completed between October 24, 2014, and February 22, 2017.  She is also 
enrolled in a training entitled “TK-12 Dual Language Articulation” to be presented on May 
3, 2017. 

18. Monique Oswald teaches fifth grade at Sherman Academy and has a 
September 17, 2010, seniority date.  Ms. Oswald holds clear General Subjects/Elementary 
and Multiple Subject teaching credentials.

 
Ms. Oswald believes that she has the special training to teach students English in the 
DI program.  As she explained, English teachers have to understand how Spanish language 
works, she helped to develop curriculum collaboratively, and she has worked with a Spanish 
foreign language expert.

19.

Lindsay Theel is a third grade bi-literacy teacher at Carson Elementary.  She 

holds preliminary General Subjects/Elementary, Multiple Subject Teaching and English 
Reading Language Arts credentials.  She has a seniority date of August 27, 2014.  While she 
acknowledged that the District considers dual immersion and bi-literacy education two 
separate programs, Ms. Theel stressed that bi-literacy education has the same credentialing 
requirements as dual immersion education.  The goal, she noted, is to make students fluent.

20.

Respondents in this category were impressive witnesses who displayed a 

command of their subject areas and an evident commitment to teaching and teaching foreign 
languages.  This proceeding is not a reflection on their qualities as teachers but a proceeding 
to assess the validity of the applicable skip category.  

Evaluation Regarding the Qualifications of Teachers In the DI Category and Application of 
the DI Skip to Them   

21.

The District demonstrated a specific need for persons to teach DI under 

Section 44955 subdivision (d)(1), and pursuant to this section proposes skipping one Spanish 
teacher, Ms. Vargas. However, two teachers, Linda Guerra-Adame and Laura Varela, who 
are more senior than Ms. Vargas, testified and presented evidence that proved they have the 
necessary training and experience to teach DI, even though these teachers did not meet the 
District’s skip criteria because they did not teach DI during the 2016-2017 school year.  This 
skip criterion was too narrowly drawn and effectively precluded consideration of Ms. 
Guerra-Adame’s and Ms. Varela’s qualifications to teach DI.  Ms. Guerra-Adame holds a 
BCLAD and a clear Bilingual Spanish teaching credential, and she has taught bilingual
education in elementary school.  Ms. Varela also holds a BCLAD and has been a visiting 
teacher in dual immersion classes at Sherman Elementary and at the Language Academy.  
She has, in addition, received training in DI instruction between October 24, 2014, and 
February 22, 2017. 

Because Ms. Guerra-Adame and Ms. Varela possess the special training and 
experience necessary to teach in Spanish in the DI program, the District may not terminate 
them while retaining a teacher with less seniority to provide that service. 

11

Therefore, the District may not rely upon the exception to the seniority rule, under 

44955, subdivision (d)(1), to retain Ms. Vargas while it proposes to lay off Ms. Guerra-
Adame and Ms. Varela. Based on their seniority, these teachers are entitled to protection 
under Section 44955, subdivision (b).  

Testimony and Evidence Regarding Transitional Kindergarten

22.

Debra Harmon teaches at Chavez Elementary and has a seniority date of 

March 16, 2010.  She has been identified as part of the TK skip.  Ms. Harmon has attended 
TK specific trainings.  

Ms. Harmon stressed the developmental difference between TK students and regular 

kindergarten students.  TK students are more egocentric than students in regular kindergarten 
and require a great deal more attention in developing their social skills and skills performing 
daily activities.    

23.

Rebecca Hedden teaches at Hardy Elementary and has a seniority date of 

August 29, 2014.  She has been identified as part of the TK skip.  Ms. Hedden has been a TK 
and extended TK teacher.  Ms. Hedden has implemented instructional techniques and 
instruction.

24.

Terese Cowell teaches at Spreckels Elementary and has an August 27, 2014,
seniority date and has been identified as part of the TK skip.  Ms. Cowell teaches a full TK 
class.  She has attended numerous trainings; she has taught kindergarten and a combined 
kindergarten and TK class.  Ms. Cowell noted that the affidavit was created because the 
District had problems filling TK positions.      

25.

Kaia Blackman teaches kindergarten at Audubon Elementary.  She holds clear 

General Subjects/Elementary and Multiple Subject Teaching credentials, and she has a 
seniority date of September 2, 2014.  She has not taught TK but applied to teach TK.  Ms. 
Blackman was not asked to sign the affidavit.  She would be willing to teach TK and 
complete required training by August 2020, as set forth under Section 48000.  

26.

Jamie Jensen teaches kindergarten at Salk Elementary.  She holds clear 

General Subjects/Elementary and Multiple Subject Teaching credentials.  She has a seniority 
date of September 2, 2010.  Ms. Jensen was scheduled to teach TK next year at Salk but has 
been proposed to be laid off.  She is taking childhood development credits but is not 
credentialed.  She said she would be willing to teach TK next year; she would be willing to 
take three District trainings by August 2020, per Section 48000.  Ms. Jensen said that she did 
not sign an affidavit because she was not given an affidavit to sign.  She said she would be 
willing to sign the affidavit.  

27.

Lana Webb teaches kindergarten at Foster Elementary.  She holds clear 

General Subjects/Elementary and Multiple Subject Teaching credentials.  Ms. Webb has a 
seniority date of September 2, 2014.  She has not taught TK.  For the 2017-2018 school year, 

12

Ms. Webb has been offered to teach TK, and she signed an affidavit.  She said she would be 
willing by August 2020 to take three District trainings per Section 48000.  

28.

Olga Fulke teaches a third/fourth grade combined class at Normal Heights 
Elementary.  She holds clear General Subjects/Elementary and Multiple Subject Teaching 
credentials.  Ms. Fulke worked as a substitute teacher for eight years.  By stipulation of the 
parties, she has a seniority date of September 9, 2014.   

Ms. Fulke has taught kindergarten; she has not taught TK but would be willing to 

teach TK.  Ms. Fulke has completed 24 credits in early childhood education.  She would sign 
an affidavit.  

29.

Kirstin Wilson teaches third grade at Joyner Elementary.  She holds clear 

General Subjects/Elementary and Multiple Subject Teaching credentials.  She has a seniority 
date of August 27, 2014.  

Ms. Wilson taught TK in the 2014-2015 school year where she taught 32 students 

including 5 kindergarten students.  As a result of her experience teaching TK in 2014-2015, 
under Education Code Section 48000, she is qualified to teach TK.  Ms. Wilson was not 
offered to sign an affidavit.  Ms. Wilson emphasized that she is willing to teach TK.  She 
recognized the distinctiveness of teaching TK and noted that she has been teaching 3rd grade 
since the 2015-2016 school year because that was where she was assigned.  

30.

As an offer of proof, the following teachers represented that they are qualified 
to teach TK as specified by Section 48000, subdivision (g); would accept a position teaching 
TK if retained for the 2017-2018 school year; and are not currently assigned to teach TK for 
the 2016-2017 school year.  The District did not dispute or rebut this offer of evidence.

31.

The respondents who testified were very credible and presented as teachers 
dedicated to teaching elementary school students.  It bears repeating that this proceeding is 
not a reflection on their qualities as teachers.  

Evaluation Regarding the Qualifications of Teachers in the TK Category and Application of 
the TK Skip to Them 

32.

The District demonstrated a specific need for persons to teach TK under 

section 44955 subdivision (d)(1).  Pursuant to this section, the District proposes skipping
several teachers, Debra Harmon, Terese Cowell, and Rebecca Hedden.  Ms. Harmon has a 
seniority date of March 16, 2010.  Ms. Cowell has a seniority date of August 27, 2014.  Ms. 
Hedden has a seniority date of August 29, 2014.  The following senior teachers came 
forward and showed that they have the necessary special training and experience to teach 
TK, based on the offer of proof submitted by teachers, and in Ms. Jensen’s case, based on her 
testimony: 

Kachina Shanks (seniority date of September 2, 2009), Jamie Jensen (seniority date of 

September 2, 2010), Arielle Sykes (seniority date of September 1, 2010), Allison Paredes 

14

(seniority date of November 1, 2010), Dusty Pedrotti (seniority date of August 29, 2012), 
Maryana Pham (seniority date of August 27, 2014), Kimberly Miller (seniority date of 
August 27, 2014), Tracy Chasteene (seniority date of August 27, 2014), Chelsea Williams 
(seniority date of August 27, 2014), Katherine Luera (seniority date of August 27, 2014), and 
Shari Osuch (seniority date of August 27, 2014).  

The conclusion that these teachers have the necessary special training and experience 
to teach TK is reached even though these teachers did not teach during the 2016-2017 school 
year and did not submit signed affidavits.  These criteria are found to be too narrowly drawn 
and effectively precluded consideration of the skills and qualifications of teachers subject to 
being terminated.  

The District, therefore, may not use the too-narrowly-drawn skip criteria to rely upon 

the exception to the seniority rule under section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), to retain Ms. 
Harmon, Ms. Cowell and Ms. Hedden while it proposes to lay-off Kachina Shanks, Jamie 
Jensen, Arielle Sykes, Allison Paredes, Dusty Pedrotti, Maryana Pham, Kimberly Miller, 
Tracy Chasteene, Chelsea Williams, Katherine Luera, and Shari Osuch.  Based on their 
seniority, these teachers are entitled to protection under section 44955, subdivision (b).  

Miscellaneous Considerations  

33.

There was no evidence that the District proposes to eliminate any services that 

are mandated by state or federal laws or regulations.

34.

Respondents argued that the District over-noticed teachers for layoffs, and the 
District’s decision to lay-off teaches was arbitrary and capricious.  This argument is rejected 
because the District has broad discretion to make budgetary decisions, and there is no 
evidence that the District’s decision was arbitrary or capricious or based on fraud.  
(Campbell Elementary Teachers Association, supra, at p. 808.) Any other assertions made 
by the parties at the hearing and not addressed above are found to be without merit and are 
rejected.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

The district complied with all notice and jurisdictional requirements set forth 

in sections 44949 and 44955.

1.

2.

The services identified in the Resolution are particular kinds of services that 

may be reduced or eliminated under section 44955.  The Board’s decision to reduce or 
eliminate the identified services was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and was a proper 
exercise of its discretion.  Cause for the reduction or elimination of services relates solely to the 
welfare of the District’s schools and students within the meaning of section 44949.

3.

Section 44955, subdivision (b), provides, in pertinent part, that, “the services 
of no permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions of this section while any 

15

probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to render a 
service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.”

4.

Section 44955, subdivision (c), provides that:

The governing board shall make assignments and reassignments 
in such a manner that employees shall be retained to render any 
service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to 
render.  However, prior to assigning or reassigning any 
certificated employee to teach a subject which he or she has not 
previously taught, and for which he or she does not have a 
teaching credential or which is not within the employee’s major 
area of postsecondary study or the equivalent thereof, the 
governing board shall require the employee to pass a subject 
matter competency test in the appropriate subject.

5.

Section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), authorizes a district to deviate from 

terminating certificated employees in order of seniority for the following reasons: 

The district demonstrates a specific need for personnel to teach 
a specific course of study, or provide services authorized by a 
services credential with a specialization in either pupil personnel 
services or health for a school nurse, and that the certificated 
employee has special training and experience necessary to teach 
that course or course of study or to provide those services, 
which others with more seniority do not possess.  

By Stipulation of the Parties Accusations are Dismissed Against Certain Respondents

6.

By stipulation, the District withdrew the preliminary layoff notices issued to 
the following persons: Michael S. Desjardins, Jacinda L. Dietz, Kristin Ann Dove, Kelsey 
Lynn Jenkins, Mary Reynolds Kirchgestner, Celestina Alejandra Kuncz, Jennifer R. 
Peterson, Teri Lyn Rosinski, Randy S. Tsuchuyima, and Katherine Lynn Wagner.  

Cause Does Not Exist to Retain Less Senior Employees Identified in the District’s 
“Deviation from Seniority (‘Skipping’)” Criteria

7.

Cause does not exist to terminate, under section 44955, subdivision (b), the 
teachers identified in Factual Findings Nos. 21 and 32.  The evidence established that these 
teachers are certificated and competent to teach in their respective programs, and the District 
may not apply the exception set forth under section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), to terminate 
them.  

16

Cause Exists to Reduce or Eliminate Particular Kinds of Services

8.

Cause exists to reduce or eliminate 891.04 FTE of particular kinds of services 
and to give notice to the remaining respondents that their services will be reduced or will not 
be required for the 2017-2018 school year because of the reduction or elimination of 
particular kinds of services.  The services of no permanent employee shall be terminated 
while any other employee with less seniority is retained to render a service the permanent 
employee is certificated and competent to render.

ORDER

1.

Pursuant to stipulation, the preliminary layoff notices issued to Michael S. 

Desjardins, Jacinda L. Dietz, Kristin Ann Dove, Kelsey Lynn Jenkins, Mary Reynolds 
Kirchgestner, Celestina Alejandra Kuncz, Jennifer R. Peterson, Teri Lyn Rosinski, Randy S. 
Tsuchuyima, and Katherine Lynn Wagner are rescinded.  The District Statements of 
Reduction in Force against these respondents are dismissed.  

2.

According to, and within the limits of, the Resolution identifying PKS for 

reduction or elimination by Full Time Equivalents, notices may be given to the remaining 
respondents as identified at Appendix C that their services will be reduced or will not be 
required for the 2017-2018 school year.  Notices shall be given in the reverse order of 
seniority and after application of the Board’s tie-breaking criteria.
