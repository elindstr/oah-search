FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

James Franco is the Superintendent of the Tracy Unified School District. He

performed his duties solely in his official capacity.

2.

Before February 22, 2011, the Superintendent determined that funding for the
2011-2012 school year would be reduced, thereby necessitating the reduction or elimination
of certain particular kinds of services. The Superintendent recommended to the Board that
certain particular kinds of services be reduced or eliminated, affecting employees occupying
76.9 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. The Superintendent’s resolution to eliminate and
reduce teaching services was made solely for the welfare of students.

3.

On February 22, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution No. 10-19, providing for

the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of services, resulting in the reduction or
elimination of 76.9 certificated positions.

4.

On March 2, 2011, the Board adopted Resolution No. 10-23, which provided
for the removal of certificated positions from Resolution No. 10-19. The second resolution
reduced the number of certificated positions subject to reduction or elimination by 11.7 FTE.
As a result of the Board’s passage of these two resolutions, a total of 65.2 FTE certificated
positions were identified for elimination or reduction.

5.

On March 14, 2011, the Superintendent served on persons affected by the

reduction and elimination of particular kinds of services a “Recommendation That Services
Will Not Be Required” for the ensuing 2011–2012 school year (Layoff Notice or Notice).
The Notice stated that the Superintendent had recommended to the Board that notice be
given to respondents pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, that their
services would not be required for the ensuing school year. The Notice advised that the
Board had passed Resolutions reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services in order
to reduce certificated staff, and included copies of the Resolutions identifying the particular
kinds of services to be reduced or eliminated.

6.

7.

Respondents timely requested a hearing to determine if there was cause for not

re-employing them for the ensuing school year.

The Superintendent made and filed Accusations against each of the employees

who requested a hearing. The Accusations, required accompanying documents, and blank
Notices of Defense were timely served on those employees.

2

8.

Respondents timely filed Notices of Defense to the Accusations.

9.

At hearing, the District and those respondents represented by Mr. Driscoll,
entered into the Stipulation attached hereto. The Stipulation provides that: 1) While the
District makes no admissions of wrongdoing regarding rehire and classification of teachers
listed as temporary for the 2010-2011 school year; certain respondents identified in the
Stipulation are afforded rehire rights for 39 months as laid off permanent employees, 2)
Layoff Notices issued to certain respondents identified in the Stipulation are rescinded, and
3) Layoff Notices issued to certain respondents identified in the Stipulation are partially
rescinded.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

Applicable Laws

44949 and 44955 were met.

1.

2.

All notice and jurisdictional requirements set forth in Education Code sections

The anticipation of receiving less money from the state for the next school

year is an appropriate basis for a reduction in services under section 44955. As stated in San
Jose Teachers Assn v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 638-639, the reduction of particular
kinds of services on the basis of financial considerations is authorized under that section,
and, “in fact, when adverse financial circumstances dictate a reduction in certificated staff,
section 44955 is the only statutory authority available to school districts to effectuate that
reduction.” The District must be solvent to provide educational services and cost savings are
necessary to resolve its financial crisis. The Superintendent’s decision to reduce particular
kinds of services was a proper exercise of his discretion.

3.

The services identified in Board Resolutions 10-19 and 10-23, are particular

kinds of services that could be reduced or discontinued under Education Code section 44955.
Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees of the District due to the
reduction and discontinuation of particular kinds of services. Cause for the reduction or
discontinuation of services relates solely to the welfare of the District’s schools and pupils
within the meaning of section 44949.

4.

A District may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not,
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.)

5.

The Notices sent to respondents indicated the statutory basis for the reduction of

services and, therefore, were sufficiently detailed to provide them due process. (San Jose
Teachers Association v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627; Santa Clara Federation of
Teachers v. Governing Board (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831.) The description of services to be
reduced, both in the Board’s Resolutions and in the Notices, adequately describes particular
kinds of services. (Zalac v. Ferndale USD (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838. See, also, Degener v.
Governing Board (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 689.)

6.

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 to provide final

Notice to respondents not identified in the Stipulation for rescission, that their services will
not be required in the 2011-2012 school year because of the reduction and elimination of
particular kinds of services.
