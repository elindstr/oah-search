Consequently, this proposed decision focuses exclusively on the Exhibit A respondents.

Prior to March 15, 2010, all respondents were served with copies of the board 

resolutions, a Notice of Recommendation that Services Will Be Terminated, a Request for 
Hearing form, and copies of Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. The Notice of 
Recommendation that Services Will be Terminated advised respondents as follows:  

“You are hereby notified that the undersigned has recommended 

to the Governing Board of the School District that you be given notice 
that your services may be terminated at the close of the current school 
pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. The reasons for 
this action are set forth in the attached Resolutions adopted by the 
Governing Board on February 1, 2010. 

 
You are advised you may request a hearing to determine if there 

is cause for not reemploying you for the 2010-2011 school year.   

 
Your request for hearing must be in writing and delivered before 

February 19, 2010. If you fail to request the hearing on or before this 
date, your failure will constitute a waiver of your right to a hearing.”  
(Exh. 25.) 
 
19.  All 200 respondents timely submitted their notices of defense requesting a 

hearing to determine if cause exists for not re-employing them for the ensuing year.  

Each respondent who requested a hearing and filed a Notice of Defense was 

timely served with a Statement to Respondent, a copy of the Accusation, Copies of 
Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 and Government Code sections 11506, 11507.5, 
11507.6, 11507.7 and 11520, a Blank Notice of Defense and a Notice of Hearing that

b) 

Does long-term substitute experience with the district count as “Prior

Should certain training taken by some respondents prior to the start of 
their first school year with the district be considered in determining 
those respondents’ seniority dates? 

26. 

The issues set forth in Finding 25, above, do not alter the fact that the 200 

 
 
respondents listed in Exhibit A, attached hereto, will remain subject to being laid off in the 
instant reduction in force (RIF) proceedings. Since jurisdiction in this matter only extends to 
a recommendation concerning the RIF, the district’s relevancy objection to the evidence 
concerning these issues was sustained. However, there were concerns expressed about the 
proper forum in which such issues should be resolved, as they are important issues that relate 
to recall and substitute teaching order. It seems that the only procedural mechanism currently 
in place to address differences in opinion concerning seniority dates is by way of Writ 
proceedings in the Superior Court.3 In order to minimize the need to resort to Writ 
proceedings that would only serve to further burden the already over-burdened Superior 
Courts, the ALJ elected to receive evidence on the seniority issues and include a 
recommendation concerning those issues in the instant recommendation to the board 
concerning the relevant RIF evidence. In view of this recurring problem in RIF proceedings 
the parties, through their bargaining units, are encouraged to establish administrative 
procedures, whether through the Office of Administrative Hearings or a similar agency, to 
address seniority issues when differences arise. With respect to the seniority issues presented 
in the instant proceedings, the evidence revealed the following: 
 

Gill was hired as an intern on July 27, 2005 and worked in that capacity 
until she was released from service on June 30, 2006. Gill was then 
rehired as a “Sub” on August 28, 2006, approximately two months after 
her June 30, 2006 release. Gill worked as a “Sub” for the district at 
Educational Options Center for 51 days and was then hired as a “Prob 
1” on November 13, 2006.  Given this employment history, Gill should 
be given credit for one year of prior service to be “tacked on” to her 
current seniority date. 

Board resolution number 2009/10-38, which was duly adopted by the 
board on February 1, 2010, established tie-breaking criteria that apply 
to certificated probationary employees with shared seniority dates. 
Pursuant to this resolution, criterion F provides that certificated 
probationary employees with “prior contracted certificated experience” 
with the district are credited with one (1) tie-breaking point. If, as 
suspected, the respondents with prior long-term substitute experience 
with the district worked under contract with the district for their long-

                                                 
3 In this regard, the ALJ finds that the parties have no administrative remedies currently in place; therefore, they 
have exhausted their administrative remedies for purposes of pursuing Writs in the Superior Court.

c) 

term employment they should be credited with one (1) tie-breaking 
point for their prior teaching experience.     

Testimony was presented that focused on several types of training that 
were taken by certain respondents during the summer break, prior to 
the start of the official school year. The trainings included new teacher 
training/orientation, technology training for newly designed, state of 
the art classrooms, GATE training, and “Houghton-Mufflin” training. 
The district intended to convey the information to respondents that 
although it was not mandatory for them to attend training in the 
summer, before the start of the school year, it was mandatory that they 
complete the training within a reasonable time after commencing their 
employment with the district, whether on weekends, during the school 
day, or after hours. District schedules for the programs revealed that 
there were dates for training during the school year as well as during 
the summer, before the school year commenced. Notwithstanding the 
district’s intent, the evidence revealed that in numerous instances 
school principals provided only partial information to respondents that 
led them to reasonably believe that summer training, prior to the start of 
the school year, was mandatory so that they would be up to speed with 
new techniques and new technology before the first day of class. 
Although the respondents were paid at the contractually agreed upon 
reduced “in service” training rate of pay, the teachers were only aware 
of the fact that they were being paid for their services and assumed they 
were getting the reduced rate because they were not fully engaged in 
classroom teaching. Respondents, who were newly hired teachers, did 
not question the site principals about the need to attend the summer 
trainings because they were thankful for their employment and did not 
want to start out by being perceived as less than fully committed to 
their teaching careers. In some cases, respondents canceled pre-planned 
vacations, diverted their family and child care duties to others, and 
made other sacrifices to clear their schedules so they could attend the 
“mandatory” training. 

 

Administrative Proposed Decisions regarding what constitutes the “first date 

 
 
of paid service” for purposes of establishing seniority dates focus on evaluating the evidence 
to see if the training was mandatory or voluntary and whether the teachers were paid a per 
diem rate of pay based on their employment contract rate of pay. However, there is no 
statute, regulation, or case law that expressly states that the first day of paid service has to be 
at per diem rate based on an employee’s contractual rate of pay. Consequently, it seems that 
the rate of pay is only one factor to be considered in evaluating whether the training was 
mandatory or voluntary. Certainly, if teachers are not being paid for their training the training 
date can not be their first day of “paid” service. However, if they are being paid for the 
training, even at a reduce rate of pay, it is a “paid” day of service. The pivotal question boils 
down to whether the paid service is “mandatory.” If it is mandatory and the teachers are paid, 
it is then the first day of paid service for purposes of establishing a seniority date.  

10

 

 

 

The district and the school site principals control the flow of information to the 

 
 
teachers. It is up to the district and its agents (the school principals and administrators) to 
make it clear to new teachers when training is mandatory. Consequently, for purposes of 
determining when training is “mandatory,” the analysis, which is factually based, must focus 
upon what an ordinary, reasonably prudent, person (ORPP) in the same or similar position 
would have reasonably believed. In the present instance, the testimony of respondents Teri 
Stamen, Jamie Aballi, Danielle Wertz, and Amanda Etheredge established that they, and 
respondents in their same situations, reasonably believed that the summer training sessions 
they attended were mandatory. Their testimony further established that an ORPP in their 
position would have reasonably reached the same conclusions. They were paid for their 
attendance and they, and other respondents in the same or similar situations, should be 
credited with their first date of training attendance as their initial seniority dates.    
 
 
the accusation was dismissed as to Alexander Bumpus and Mary Gonzalez; therefore, they 
are not listed on Exhibit A, attached hereto. Additionally, pursuant to stipulation, several 
seniority dates were changed with respect to certain respondents. Since those modifications 
have already been made and the changes do not alter the fact that those respondents remain 
part of the instant RIF proceedings, that information will not be set forth herein. 
   
 

Pursuant to the stipulation of the parties, the layoff notices were rescinded and
