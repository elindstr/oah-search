By March 15, 2012, Respondents received notice that their services will not be

which may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.1

The Governing Board took action to reduce or discontinue the services set forth
in factual finding number 3 primarily because the District has a large budget shortfall and it
faces potential bankruptcy in the future. The decision to reduce the particular kinds of services
is neither arbitrary nor capricious but is rather a proper exercise of the District's discretion.

stipulated that Knehnetski, Marquez, and Whitfield will be re-employed and continued to be
employed as permanent employees in the 2012-2013 school year.

12.

The parties stipulated that Marquez should have been served with a preliminary
notice, and because the District failed to do so, the District agreed to rescind the notice and
withdraw the Accusation against Respondent Kelly Iwamoto.

No certificated employee junior to any Respondent was retained to render a

service which any Respondent is certificated and competent to render.
