PROPOSED DECISION 

Administrative Law Judge Juliet E. Cox, State of California, Office of Administrative 

Hearings, heard this matter on May 1, 2019, in San Carlos, California. 

Attorney at Law Tami E. Culkar represented complainant Michelle Harmeier, 

Superintendent of the San Carlos School District. 

Attorney at Law Christopher Schumb represented all respondents. 

The matter was submitted on May 1, 2019. 

FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1. 

At its February 28, 2019, meeting, the Governing Board of the San Carlos 

School District adopted District Resolution 12:18/19 (the PKS Resolution).  The PKS 
Resolution declares the District’s intention for the 2019–2020 school year to reduce services 
as follows: Counselors, 2.2 full-time equivalent positions (FTE); Elementary Teachers, 4.0 
FTE; Middle School Teachers, 2.0 FTE; Elective Teacher, 1.0 FTE. 

2. 

The District’s Assistant Superintendent gave timely notice in writing to 

respondents Carol Campbell, Andrea Dimas, Laura MacFarlane, and Wendy Salazar that the 
District’s executive staff members would recommend to the District Board that the District 
not re-employ these respondents for the 2019–2020 school year.  Each respondent’s notice 
stated that the PKS Resolution and “the seniority and qualifications of each of the certificated 
employees of the District” would be the bases for the recommendation against 
re-employment. 

3. 

All respondents requested hearings on their re-employment.  Acting in her 

official capacity as Superintendent of the District, Michelle Harmeier signed a Statement of 
Reduction in Force alleging the District’s grounds for not re-employing respondents for the 
2019–2020 school year.  Each respondent received timely service of the Statement of 
Reduction in Force, and each filed a timely Notice of Participation in the hearing. 

Elective Teacher 

4. 

Respondent Carol Campbell is a certificated District employee who holds a 

clear single-subject credential authorizing her to teach German.  Campbell received a notice 
from the District, as described in Finding 2, because of its decision to reduce services 
provided by an Elective Teacher. 

5. 

Harmeier recommends that the District employ Campbell for the 2019–2020 
school year, but on terms somewhat different from the terms of Campbell’s employment for 
the 2018–2019 school year.  In reliance on Harmeier’s explanation of the 2019–2020 school 
year employment terms, Campbell elected at the hearing not to contest the recommendation 
against her re-employment for the 2019–2020 school year in the position she held for the 
2018–2019 school year. 

6. 

No permanent or probationary employee with less seniority is being retained 

to render a service for which Campbell is certificated and competent. 

Counselors 

8. 

9. 

7. 

Respondents Wendy Salazar, Andrea Dimas, and Laura MacFarlane are 

certificated District employees who hold clear pupil personnel services credentials 
authorizing them to work as school counselors.  They received notices from the District, as 
described in Finding 2, because of its decision to reduce services provided by Counselors. 

Dimas and MacFarlane did not attend the hearing. 

Before the District’s Governing Board adopted the PKS Resolution, it worked 

with the District’s executive staff, with community members, and with the San Mateo 
County Office of Education to analyze and evaluate the District’s services and financial 
resources.  The District will continue during the 2019–2020 school year to offer counseling 
services to its students.  After the reduction by 2.2 FTE, the District will retain personnel 
representing 4.0 FTE. 

10.  No permanent or probationary employee with less seniority is being retained 
to render a service for which Salazar, Dimas, or MacFarlane is certificated and competent.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 
44955.  The District’s pre-hearing notices and actions, described in Findings 1 through 3, 
satisfied these statutes’ requirements. 

2. 

Because of the matters stated in Findings 1, 5, 8, and 9, the services listed in 

the PKS Resolution are services that may be reduced or discontinued under applicable 
statutory and decisional law. 

3. 

The matters stated in Findings 5, 8, and 9 confirm that the decision to reduce 
the services stated in the PKS Resolution, by the amounts stated in that resolution, is neither 
arbitrary nor capricious; instead, it is a proper exercise of the District’s discretion. 

4. 

The matters stated in Findings 6 and 10 and in Legal Conclusions 2 and 3 

constitute cause under Education Code section 44955 to give notice to respondents that their 
services will not be required for the upcoming 2019–2020 school year.  In accordance with 
Education Code section 44949, the cause relates solely to the welfare of the schools and the 
pupils thereof. 

RECOMMENDATION 

The San Carlos School District may give notice to respondents that the District will 

not require respondents’ services for the 2019–2020 school year.
