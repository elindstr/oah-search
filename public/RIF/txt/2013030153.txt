FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

2.

Steven Lawrence filed the Accusation in his official capacity as

Superintendent of the Mt. Diablo Unified School District.

Respondents are listed on Attachment A. Each Respondent is a certificated

employee of the District.

3.

On February 25, 2013, the District’s Governing Board adopted Resolution No.
12/13-30, establishing a process for determining seniority among certificated employees with
the same seniority date (tiebreaker resolution).

4.

On March 11, 2013, the Board adopted Resolution No. 12/13-35, reducing or

discontinuing particular kinds of services for the 2013-2014 school year and directing the
Superintendent or his designee to give appropriate notices to certificated employees whose
positions will be affected by the action. The Resolution was based upon Superintendent
Lawrence’s report that the reductions were necessary because of the District’s projected
budget deficits.

5.

On or before March 15, 2013, Superintendent Lawrence gave written notice to

Respondents of the recommendation that their services will not be required for the
2013-2014 school year. The reasons for the recommendation were set forth in these
preliminary layoff notices.

6.

Respondents filed timely requests for a hearing to determine if there is cause
for terminating their services for the 2013-2014 school year. An accusation was served on
Respondents, all of whom are deemed to have filed timely notices of defense. All prehearing
jurisdictional requirements have been met.

Before issuing the preliminary layoff notices, the District took into account all

positively assured attrition. The District must issue the final layoff notices before May 15,
and when it does so the District will take into account any additional attrition that has
occurred.

9.

The Parties stipulated that the listed seniority dates of Respondents Martha

Boyle and Christina Deasy are incorrect, and that the District will correct the dates when it
determines which date in August 2011 is accurate.

Skipping issue

10.

Resolution No. 12/13-35 contains the following statement:

“Competency” for the purpose of Education Code
section 44955 shall be determined solely upon current
possession of a preliminary or clear credential for the
subject matter or grade level to which the employee will
be assigned at the beginning of the 2013-2014 school
year.

3

11.

Resolution No. 12/13-35 also states:

There is a direct and specific need within the District for
certificated employees qualified to serve the needs of
K-12 students with respect to the following:

a. Courses requiring Bilingual Cross-Cultural Language
and Development (BCLAD) certificates, which are
highly specialized programs requiring the possession and
utilization of additional specialized certificates and/or
credentials. Teachers must actively be using their
BCLAD certification in their assignment to be skipped.

b. Bilingual School Psychologists.

Pursuant to Education Code section 44955(d)(1), it will
be necessary to retain the services of certificated
employees in the 2013-2013 school year, regardless of
seniority, who possess these qualifications as
demonstrated by the possession of a valid certificate
and/or credential and use of that certificate and/or
credential in the employee’s 2013-2014 assignment.

12.

The District decided to skip for layoff four teachers who hold BCLAD

certificates. If that occurs, teachers who are senior to them and also hold BCLAD
certificates (Heather Riggs, Eve Lowenstein, Maria Farias and Jessica Mew) will be laid off.
In support of this decision, District argued that the more senior teachers are not presently in
an assignment where a BCLAD certificate is required. In addition, the District plans to use
the skipped teachers in BCLAD-required assignments next year.

13.

Other than the planned skip set forth in Finding 12, no certificated employee

junior in seniority to any Respondent is being retained by the District to perform services that
any Respondent is certificated and competent to render.

14.

All contentions made by Respondents not specifically addressed above are

found to be without merit and are rejected.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Cause exists because of the reduction or elimination of particular kinds of

services pursuant to Education Code section 44955 to give notice to Respondents in
94.92203 full-time equivalent positions that their services will not be required for the

4

2013-2014 school year. The cause relates solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils
thereof within the meaning of Education Code section 44949.

2.

Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), requires a district to proceed

in inverse order of seniority when effectuating an economic layoff. An exception to this
provision is contained in Education Code section 44955, subdivision (d)(1), which allows
deviation from seniority when:

. . . the district demonstrates a specific need for personnel to
teach a specific course or course of study . . . and that the
certificated employee has special training or experience
necessary to teach that course or course of study or to provide
those services . . . which others with more seniority do not
possess.

The District did not demonstrate that the proposed skip of the four junior teachers

holding BCLAD certificates meets the requirements of Education Code section 44955,
subdivision (b). The senior teachers are competent to teach in assignments requiring a
BCLAD certificate under the District’s defined competency standards. There was no
evidence that the junior teachers possess special training and experience that the senior
teachers do not. The District’s proposed BCLAD skip, as described in Finding 12, is invalid.

ORDER

1.

Notice may be given to Respondents in 94.92203 FTE positions that their
services will not be required for the 2013-2014 school year because of the reduction or
elimination of particular kinds of services.

2.

Heather Riggs, Eve Lowenstein, Maria Farias and Jessica Mew may not be

laid off in favor of Respondents with BCLAD certificates, who have less seniority.
