FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

On March 14, 2011, Dr. Darryl Adams, Interim Superintendent of the

Coachella Valley Unified School District (hereafter, “the District”), made and filed the
accusations against respondents in his official capacity.

Respondents are certificated employees of the District.

2.

3.

Before March 15, 2011, pursuant to Education Code sections 44949 and

44955, Dr. Adams notified the Board of Education (hereafter, “the Board”) of the District of
the Superintendent’s recommendation that respondents be notified their services will not be
required for the ensuing school year. The Superintendent's notification to the Board set forth
the reasons for the recommendation.

4.

On or before March 15, 2011, each respondent was given written notice that

the Superintendent had recommended that notice be given to respondents, pursuant to
Education Code sections 44949 and 44955, that their services will not be required for the
ensuing year. Each written notice set forth the reasons for the recommendation. The notices
satisfied the requirements of sections 44949 and 44955. San Jose Teachers Association, Inc.
v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 632; Campbell Elementary Teachers Association v.
Abbott (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 796, 803-04, distinguishing Karbach v. Board of Education
(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 355, 360-63.

5.

Each respondent timely requested in writing a hearing to determine if there is

cause for not reemploying them for the ensuing school year. Accusations were timely served
on respondents, and each respondent filed a timely Notice of Defense. All pre-hearing
jurisdictional requirements have been met.

6.

The Board took action in Resolution No. 2011-78 to discontinue the following

services for the 2011-12 school year:

Directors

Coordinators

Principals

Assistant Principals

Student Facilitators

Teacher on Special Assignments

Nurses

Counselors

Certificated Librarians

K-6 Elementary Teachers

The resolution further provided:

“That "competency" as described in Education Code section 44955(b) for the

purposes of bumping shall necessarily include possession of a valid credential
authorizing service in the relevant subject matter area.”

The services set forth above are particular kinds of services which may be reduced or

discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955. California Teachers
Association v. Board of Trustees of the Goleta Union School District (1982) 132 Cal.App.3d
32, 34-37 and cases cited therein. See also San Jose Teachers Association v. Allen, supra at
635-38, in which the court specifically rejected the reasoning of Burgess v. Board of
Education (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 571; Zalac v. Governing Board (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838,
853-54.

Furthermore, these services may be reduced because of budgetary difficulties. Zalac

v. Governing Board, supra, and cases cited therein. The decision to reduce or discontinue
the services is neither arbitrary nor capricious but rather a proper exercise of the District's
discretion.

7.

No certificated employee junior to any respondent is retained to perform

services which any respondent is certificated and competent to render.

8.

The reduction or discontinuation of services is related to the welfare of the
District and its pupils, and it has become necessary to decrease the number of certificated
employees of the District as determined by the Board.

9.

The Board considered all known attrition, resignations, retirements and
requests for transfer in determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices to be
delivered to its employees.

10.

The Board established tie-breaker criteria for determining the relative seniority

of certificated employees who first rendered paid service on the same date. The Board of
Education provided the order of termination shall be based on the needs of the District and its
students. The criteria were to be applied based on information on file as of March 14, 2011,
one step at a time, until the tie was broken in accordance with the following:

3

“1.

Highly Qualified Status under NCLB in area of assignment (employees

If ties cannot be broken by using the above criteria then order of

seniority shall be determined by a random drawing of lots among employees in the
individual tie.”

11.

The District created a Seniority List which contains employees’ seniority dates

(first date of paid service), status, grade, site, assignment, position title, credentials, ELD,
NCLB, and notes. The District used the Seniority List to develop a proposed layoff and
“bumping” list of the least senior employees currently assigned in the services being reduced.
The District then determined whether the least senior employees held credentials in another
area and were entitled to “bump” other employees. In determining who would be laid off for
each kind of service reduced, the District counted the number of reductions not covered by
the known vacancies, and determined the impact on incumbent staff in inverse order of
seniority. The District then checked the credentials of affected individuals and whether they
could “bump” other employees.

12. William Duffy (seniority date of May 3, 1993) is a Teacher on Special

Assignments (TOSA) and holds one of the 33 such positions the Board eliminated and is
therefore subject to layoff. He has served on this special assignment since 2004. He

5

presently works in the district office performing such tasks as assessments and managing the
District’s database. His work involves computers, photography, and video, and he uses all of
his credentials in performing his work. He is senior to Guadalupe Jimenez who teaches
computers in adult education, and in fact he created the program she currently teaches. Mr.
Duffy believes he is credentialed and competent to teach computers in adult education and
believes he should be able to bump Ms. Jimenez.

13.

Arthur Bias (seniority date of September 2, 2004) teaches high school driver

education and holds a life credential as a technician in public safety and driver education.
The District proposes to lay him off.

14. Monica Perez (seniority date of October 1, 2009) holds a preliminary single
subject credential in English, and teaches eleventh and twelfth grade English. The District
proposes to lay off Ms. Perez.

Lauren Budd (seniority date of August 15, 2007) holds a clear multiple subject

credential and has a minor in introductory English. She teaches first grade. The District
used her English minor to bump Ms. Perez but does not plan to use Ms. Budd to teach
eleventh or twelfth grade English.

15. Mark Ruiz (seniority date of August 31, 2006) teaches two ceramics classes at

the seventh and eighth grade level and four physical education classes. He also has a prep
period during sixth period, and his third period prep class has him travelling from the high
school to the middle school. The District proposes to eliminate the two ceramic classes as
part of its two FTE reduction in art, and calculates that his two classes constitute 0.33 FTE.
Mr. Ruiz believes the percentage should be less because one of the classes is funded by a
SIG grant, and also should be less because he is assigned more than six classes.

16.

Lorelei Ceja (seniority date of November 4, 1996) holds one of the 33 TOSA

positions the District proposes to eliminate. She has a clear single subject credential in
business.

Rosa Vargas (seniority date of August 17, 2006) also has a single subject credential in
business and teaches eighth grade algebra. She holds no credential or authorization in math.
The District does not propose to lay off Ms. Vargas.

17.

Stephanie Brown (seniority date of August 26, 2010) teaches high school math
and has a 30-day substitute permit. She does not hold a credential. The District proposes to
lay her off because she is the least senior math teacher in the District. She has the same
seniority date as Patricia Razuri, who also teaches math with a 30-day substitute permit.
They are the two least senior math teachers. Ms Brown was determined to be the least senior
of the two on the basis of the tie-breaking criteria established by the District. Their tie was
broken based on the last tiebreaker criterion in that Ms. Razuri had more post-secondary
credits than Ms. Brown. The tie was correctly broken.

6

Ms. Brown testified at the hearing that she worked as a long-term substitute for more
than 75 percent of the school days during the previous two school years. She is considered a
probationary 0 because she does not have a credential. She pointed to Juan Gomez who also
teaches under a 30-day substitute permit, but he teaches science, an area not reduced by the
layoff, and he is more senior than Ms. Brown. Mr. Gomez had a provisional intern permit
for the 2008-09 school year which Ms. Brown did not have. He is also considered a
probationary 0 employee. Ms. Brown could not therefore bump Ms. Gomez.

18. Martiza Gomez-Guerrero (seniority date of August 27, 2009) holds a single
subject credential in English and teaches ninth grade English. She testified at the hearing
that she served as a long-term substitute under 30-day substitute permits during the 2008-09
and 2009-10 school years and that she taught more than 75 percent of the school days for
those school years. She has not completed her internship program and is considered a
probationary 0 employee. She recognized that the District has given her one year of seniority
for the 2009-10 school year.

19.

Araida Flores (seniority date of August 17, 2005) holds a single subject

credential in Spanish and teaches high school Spanish. The District proposes to lay off 0.6 of
her position as part of the reduction of four FTE positions in Spanish. She testified at the
hearing that she served as a long-term substitute for two years before she was hired as a
probationary teacher. She now has tenure. She recognized that the District gave her one
year of service for one year she worked as a long-term substitute but wants two years.

Zoraiday Baltazar (seniority date of September 5, 2002) holds a single subject
credential in Spanish and teaches high school Spanish. The District proposes to lay her off
as part of the reduction in Spanish. She has taught math in the past.

Nicolas Del Castillo (seniority date of August 25, 2005) also holds a single subject

credential in Spanish and teaches seventh grade algebra. He holds no credential or
authorization to teach math. The District termed this assignment “a misassignment.” The
District does not propose to lay him off but will not permit him to teach math during the next
school year.

None of these teachers are certificated and competent to teach math.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

Jurisdiction in this matter relating to the elimination of 84.2 full-time

equivalent positions exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955. All notices and
jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied.

2.

Education Code section 44955 provides in relevant part:

. . .

7

(b)
[W]henever a particular kind of service is to be reduced or discontinued not
later than the beginning of the following school year . . . and when in the opinion of
the governing board of the district it shall have become necessary . . . to decrease the
number of permanent employees in the district, the governing board may terminate
the services of not more than a corresponding percentage of the certificated
employees of the district, permanent as well as probationary, at the close of the
school year. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the services of no permanent
employee may be terminated under the provisions of this section while any
probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to
render a service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to
render. . . As between employees who first rendered paid service to the district on the
same date, the governing board shall determine the order of termination solely on the
basis of needs of the district and the students thereof. Upon the request of any
employee whose order of termination is so determined, the governing board shall
furnish in writing no later than five days prior to the commencement of the hearing
held in accordance with Section 44949, a statement of the specific criteria used in
determining the order of termination and the application of the criteria in ranking
each employee relative to the other employees in the group. This requirement that the
governing board provide, on request, a written statement of reasons for determining
the order of termination shall not be interpreted to give affected employees any legal
right or interest that would not exist without such a requirement.

(c)

. . .

The governing board shall make assignments and reassignments in such a

manner that the employees shall be retained to render any service which their
seniority and qualifications entitle them to render. . .

Notwithstanding subdivision (b), a school district may deviate from
(d)
terminating a certificated employee in order of seniority for either of the following
reasons:

(1)

The district demonstrates a specific need for personnel to teach a

specific course or course of study, or to provide services authorized by a services
credential with a specialization in either pupil personnel services or health for a
school nurse, and that the certificated employee has special training and experience
necessary to teach that course or course of study or to provide those services, which
others with more seniority do not possess.

(2)

For purposes of maintaining or achieving compliance with

constitutional requirements related to equal protection of the laws.

. . .

8

To put it more succinctly, a senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the

right to transfer to a continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to fill.
In doing so, the senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling
that position. See Lacy v. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469. Junior
teachers may be given retention priority over senior teachers if the junior teachers possess
superior skills or capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack. See Poppers v.
Tamalpais Union High School District (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 399; see also Santa Clara
Federation of Teachers, Local 2393, v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified School
District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831.

3.

Education Code section 44929.25 provides in part:

“When a teacher of classes for adults serves sufficient probationary time as

provided in Sections 44929.20 to 44929.23, inclusive, and Section 44908 to be
eligible for election to permanent classification in that district, his or her tenure shall
be for the service equivalent to the average number of hours per week that he or she
has served during his or her probationary years. In no case shall the employee be
classified as permanent for more than one full-time assignment. The service for
which the person has acquired tenure may be reduced in conformity with Sections
44955 and 44956.”

4.

Education Code section 44929.26 provides in part:

“Nothing in Sections 44929.20 to 44929.23, inclusive, shall be construed to

give permanent classification to a person in the adult school who is already classified
as a permanent employee in the day school. In case a teacher obtains permanent
classification in the evening school and later is eligible for the same classification in
the day school by reason of having served the probationary period therein, he or she
shall be given his or her choice as to which he or she shall take.”

5.

Regarding Finding 12, Mr. Duffy presently holds a TOSA position in the day

school and is considered a permanent employee of the District. While he may be senior to
Ms. Jimenez, based on sections 44929.25 and 44929.26, he cannot be considered permanent
in both the day and evening schools. He is permanent in the day school and therefore has no
right to bump a junior teacher in the adult school.

6.

Regarding Finding 13, Mr. Bias presented no authority or evidence to show

that his life credential prevents him from being laid off as the District proposes to do. In the
absence of such authority or evidence, his layoff must be upheld.

7.

Aracely Urbano testified at the hearing on behalf of the District. She has

worked in the field of personnel for 13 years and handles credentialing and assignments for
the District. She testified that a teacher who holds a multiple subject credential but who also
has a minor in a particular subject area can teach up to ninth grade with that minor. She
equated a minor with a supplementary authorization. She based her opinion on the

9

Administrator’s Assignment Manual (9/07) prepared by the California Commission on
Teacher Credentialing. She described the Manual as the “Bible” which personnel employees
follow in making decisions regarding assignments and credentials.

Section C-3 of the Glossary of terms of the manual provides in part:

“Supplementary authorizations in the introductory broad subject areas authorize the
holder to teach all the subjects that fall within the broad subject area. For example, an
introductory mathematics authorization allows the holder to teach the following
subjects but only in classes where the curriculum is designed for grades 9 and below
but the students may be in grades preschool, K-12, and adults for secondary credential
holders or a mathematics supplementary issued to holders of elementary credential
may teach in grades 9 and below: Basic or general mathematics, algebra, calculus,
computer science, consumer mathematics, geometry, mathematical analysis, statistics
and probability, and trigonometry.”

Based on the testimony of Ms. Urbano and the provisions of the Manual, it is

appropriate for the District to assign Ms. Budd to teach ninth grade high school English
because she is certificated and competent to teach that subject. She therefore may bump Ms.
Perez, even though Ms. Perez holds a single subject credential in English and taught at grade
levels above ninth grade. The District understands that it is limited in any future English
assignment made for Ms Budd to grades up to the ninth grade, but not above the ninth grade.

8.

Regarding Finding 15, Mr. Ruiz did not establish that he was entitled to have
his assignment reduced by less than .33 FTE. He taught two classes of ceramics and four of
PE for a total of six. The seniority list compiled by the District indicates he taught ceramics
and PE. There is no reason or authority to conclude that performing other services for the
District should result in a reduction in the percentage of FTE attributable to his layoff. Nor is
there any reason or authority to conclude that a different funding source for one of Mr. Ruiz’
classes should result in a reduced percentage of FTE attributable to his layoff.

9.

Regarding Finding 16, it is true that Ms. Ceja is senior to Ms Vargas, they both

have the same credential, and Ms. Vargas teaches algebra without a proper credential or
authorization. But those facts do not help Ms. Ceja. She was laid off from her TOSA
position, and she could only bump a junior teacher teaching business. Ms. Vargas was not
teaching any business courses. Consequently, Ms. Ceja could not bump into a position
taught by Ms. Vargas. Furthermore, since the District did not propose to reduce any
positions in business, it cannot be concluded that the District improperly skipped a junior
teacher (Ms. Vargas) in order to lay off a senior teacher (Ms. Ceja).

10.

Regarding Finding 19, the situation is similar to that of Ms. Ceja and Ms.

Vargas, but sufficiently different so that a different result must occur. Like Ms. Vargas, Mr.
Del Castillo taught a class (algebra) outside of his credential or authorization, but he was not
laid off, while two teachers who were senior to him, Ms. Flores and Ms. Baltazar were laid
off. And, like Ms. Ceja, neither Ms. Flores nor Ms. Baltazar are certificated and competent

10

to teach algebra and therefore cannot bump Ms. Del Castillo from his algebra assignment,
even though it was a “misassignment.”

In this situation, however, the District decided to reduce its Spanish classes by four
FTEs. Since Mr. Del Castillo is limited to teaching Spanish, and he was not laid off while
two teachers who did teach Spanish were laid off, the practical consequence of this is that the
District skipped a junior Spanish teacher to lay off two more senior Spanish teachers.

The Board chose not to include any language in its layoff resolution defining
competence and did not seek to skip any teachers as it is permitted to do by Education Code
section 49455, subdivision (d). The District offered no evidence seeking to establish a need
for a specific course of study or that Mr. Del Castillo had the special training and experience
necessary to teach such a course of study as required by section 44955, subdivision (d). See
Bledsoe v. Biggs Unified School Dist. (2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 127, 138.

It thus appears that the District inadvertently skipped Mr. Del Castillo when it

determined which Spanish teachers it was going to lay off, and laid off two more senior
teachers. Simply because the skipping was not intentional does not make it proper. In
Alexander v. Board of Trustees (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 567, 576, the Court of Appeal, after
holding that a decision by a governing board to retain junior teachers over more senior
teachers was improper, remanded the matter back to the trial court for a determination of
which teachers suffered prejudicial error. The court reasoned:

“Because at least some of the persons skipped should have received the notices, a
corresponding number of the most senior of the employees who were not reemployed
must have been improperly given notices.”

The evidence established that Mr. Del Castillo should have received a notice of
layoff, and he would have represented one FTE. Consequently, the most senior teacher who
received a notice received it improperly, and that teacher is Ms. Baltazar. She would
represent one FTE. Accordingly, Ms. Balthazar’s layoff must be set aside and the accusation
against her dismissed. Unfortunately for Ms. Flores, her partial layoff must be upheld
because there was only one improper skip.

11.

Education Code section 44918 provides in part:

Any employee classified as a substitute or temporary employee, who serves

(a)
during one school year for at least 75 percent of the number of days the regular
schools of the district were maintained in that school year and has performed the
duties normally required of a certificated employee of the school district, shall be
deemed to have served a complete school year as a probationary employee if
employed as a probationary employee for the following school year.

12.

Regarding Findings 17 and 18, both Ms. Brown and Ms. Gomez-Guerrero

seek to have a second year added to their seniority dates because they worked as long term

11

substitutes for more than one year. In Ms. Brown’s case, she has not been employed as a
probationary employee yet, but instead continues to work as a long-term substitute. She does
not have a credential. Thus, under the terms of section 44918, she would not be entitled to
receive credit for any prior school year until such time as she is employed as a probationary
employee.

In Ms. Gomez-Guerrero’s case, she received one year of seniority under section
44918, but wants a second. The terms of the statute provide for credit for “one school year”
and that year was the year before she was hired as a probationary employee. The statute does
not provide for multiple years of credit for service as a substitute employee.

13.

Any additional arguments offered by respondents have been considered and

are rejected.

14.

Cause exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 44955 for the District
to discontinue particular kinds of services relating to 157 full-time equivalent positions. The
cause for the reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services related solely to the
welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof. A preponderance of the evidence sustained the
charges set forth in the Accusation. It is recommended that the Board give respondents
notice before May 15, 2011, that their services will no longer be required by the District.

ORDER

The Accusations served on respondents Ron Alford and Kyle Endres are

dismissed.

1.

2.

3.

The Accusation served on respondent Zoraiday Baltazar is dismissed.

The Accusations served on the respondents listed on Exhibit A are sustained.

Notice shall be given to each respondent before May 15, 2011 that his or her services will not
be required for the 2011-12 school year pursuant to the Board’s resolution because of the
reduction of particular kinds of services.

Notice shall be given in inverse order of seniority.
