FACTUAL FINDINGS 

 
Jurisdictional Matters 

 
1. 

On February 18, 2010, the Governing Board of the Colton Joint Unified 

 
School District (the district) determined that it was in the best interests of the district and the 
welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof to reduce or discontinue particular kinds of 
services due to adverse financial conditions, resulting in a lessening of the number of 
certificated employees of the district.  The reduction of services of regular certificated 
employees was not based upon the decline of average daily attendance during the past two 

1

years.  In accordance with its determinations, the Governing Board passed Board Resolution 
10-06, which reduced and eliminated various particular kinds of services totaling 141 full 
time equivalent positions.  The Governing Board’s resolution directed that the reduction of 
certificated staff be achieved by terminating regular employees and not by terminating 
temporary and substitute employees.  The Governing Board enacted other measures related 
to “competency” and tie-breaking criteria that were to be applied to employees holding the 
same seniority date.  The Governing Board directed that the District Superintendent or his 
designee initiate layoff procedures and give appropriate notices to certificated employees 
affected by the resolution pursuant to Education Code sections 44955 and 44949. 
 

2. 

The particular kinds of services identified in the governing board’s resolution 
were services the governing board was authorized to reduce and discontinue.  In accordance 
with Board Resolution 10-06, preliminary layoff notices were timely served upon the most 
junior employees holding those positions that were subject to reduction and elimination.  Each 
employee who was served with a preliminary layoff notice was advised of the right to a 
hearing.  All respondents other than Heather Baird timely requested a hearing.  Heather Baird 
did not file her request for a hearing within the time specified by the district, but the district 
waived any objection to her late filing of the request.  Each employee who requested a hearing 
became a respondent in this proceeding.  As to those employees, all jurisdictional requirements 
were met.  The reduction in force hearing was set for April 30, 2010. 

 
3. 

On April 30, 2010, the hearing was called to order by James Ahler, 

 
Administrative Law Judge, Office of Administrative Proceedings.  John W. Dietrich, 
Attorney at Law, appeared on behalf of the Colton Joint Unified School District.  Jerry 
Almendarez, Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources, also appeared on behalf of the 
Colton Joint Unified School District.  Dana S. Martinez, Attorney at Law, appeared on behalf 
of most respondents who filed requests for hearing as well as respondent Heather Baird.  Dan 
Bartlett, Regional Uniserv Staff, Alford Colton Uniserv, was present on behalf of the 
California Teachers Association and its members.  No respondent in this proceeding 
represented himself or herself. 
 
The Stipulations 
 
 
The district waived any objection to respondent Heather Baird’s late filing of 
her request for a hearing and stipulated that Heather Baird was properly a respondent in the 
reduction in force proceeding.  No other party objected. 
 
 
rescinded and that the accusations filed upon all respondents be withdrawn. 
 
 

It was stipulated that the preliminary notices served upon all respondents be

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

 
Statutory Authority  
 
 

1. 

Education Code section 44944 provides in part:

(b) 

“No later than March 15 and before an employee is given notice by the 
governing board that his or her services will not be required for the ensuing year . . . 
the governing board and the employee shall be given written notice by the 
superintendent of the district or his or her designee . . . that it has been recommended 
that the notice be given to the employee, and stating the reasons therefor . . . 
 
The employee may request a hearing to determine if there is cause for 
 
not reemploying him or her for the ensuing year . . .  If an employee fails to request a 
hearing on or before the date specified, his or her failure to do so shall constitute his 
or her waiver of his or her right to a hearing . . . 
 
 
shall be conducted and a decision made in accordance with . . . the Government Code 
and the governing board shall have all the power granted to an agency therein, except 
that all of the following shall apply: 
 
 
within five days after service upon him or her of the accusation and he or she shall be 
notified of this five-day period for filing in the accusation. 
 

In the event a hearing is requested by the employee, the proceeding 

The respondent shall file his or her notice of defense, if any, 

(1) 

(c) 

 

. . . 

 

(3) 

The hearing shall be conducted by an administrative law judge 

 
 
who shall prepare a proposed decision, containing findings of fact and a 
determination as to whether the charges sustained by the evidence are related to the 
welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof.  The proposed decision shall be 
prepared for the governing board and shall contain a determination as to the 
sufficiency of the cause and a recommendation as to disposition.  However, the 
governing board shall make the final determination as to the sufficiency of the cause 
and disposition.  None of the findings, recommendations, or determinations contained 
in the proposed decision prepared by the administrative law judge shall be binding on 
the governing board.  Nonsubstantive procedural errors committed by the school 
district or governing board of the school district shall not constitute cause for 
dismissing the charges unless the errors are prejudicial errors.  Copies of the proposed 
decision shall be submitted to the governing board and to the employee on or before 
May 7 of the year in which the proceeding is commenced. . . .”  

Education Code section 44955 provides in part: 

“(a)  No permanent employee shall be deprived of his or her position for 

2. 
 
 
causes other than those specified in Sections 44907 and 44923, and Sections 44932 to 
44947, inclusive, and no probationary employee shall be deprived of his or her 
position for cause other than as specified in Sections 44948 to 44949, inclusive.

(b)  Whenever . . . a particular kind of service is to be reduced or 

 
discontinued not later than the beginning of the following school year . . . and when in 
the opinion of the governing board of the district it shall have become necessary . . . 
to decrease the number of permanent employees in the district, the governing board 
may terminate the services of not more than a corresponding percentage of the 
certificated employees of the district, permanent as well as probationary, at the close 
of the school year.  Except as otherwise provided by statute, the services of no 
permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions of this section while any 
probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to 
render a service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to 
render.  

 
. . . 
 

. . . 

As between employees who first rendered paid service to the district on the 

 
same date, the governing board shall determine the order of termination solely on the 
basis of needs of the district and the students thereof . . .   
 

(c) 

Notice of such termination of services shall be given before the 15th of 

 
 
May . . . and services of such employees shall be terminated in the inverse of the 
order in which they were employed, as determined by the board in accordance with 
the provisions of Sections 44844 and 44845.  In the event that a permanent or 
probationary employee is not given the notices and a right to a hearing as provided for 
in Section 44949, he or she shall be deemed reemployed for the ensuing school year. 
 
The governing board shall make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that 
employees shall be retained to render any service which their seniority and 
qualifications entitle them to render.  However, prior to assigning or reassigning any 
certificated employee to teach a subject which he or she has not previously taught, 
and for which he or she does not have a teaching credential or which is not within the 
employee’s major area of postsecondary study or the equivalent thereof, the 
governing board shall require the employee to pass a subject matter competency test 
in the appropriate subject. 
 
 
Notwithstanding subdivision (b), a school district may deviate from 
terminating a certificated employee in order of seniority for either of the following 
reasons: 
 
 
a specific course or course of study, or to provide services authorized by a services 
credential with a specialization in either pupil personnel services or health for a 
school nurse, and that the certificated employee has special training and experience 
necessary to teach that course or course of study or to provide those services, which 
others with more seniority do not possess. 

The district demonstrates a specific need for personnel to teach
