Respondents are certificated employees of the District. 

Respondents thereafter timely requested a hearing to determine if there is cause 

 
 
 
On  March  11,  2010,  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  (Governing  Board) 
adopted Resolution number 2009/2010-11, reducing 3.4 full-time-equivalent (FTE) positions in 
Kindergarten through Sixth Grade classroom services for the 2010-2011 school year. 
 
 
Superintendent  Lara  thereafter  provided  written  notice  to  the  Governing  Board 
that  he  recommended  the  termination  of  Respondents’ services for the 2010-2011 school year 
due to the reduction of particular kinds of services.  
 
On  March  12,  2010,  the  District  provided  notice  to  Respondents  that  their 
 
services  will  not  be  required  for  the  2010-2011  school  year  due  to  the  reduction  of  particular 
kinds of services. Respondents filed timely requests for hearing.  
 
 
for not reemploying them for the 2009-2010 school year. 
 
On  March  29,  2010,  the  District  filed  and  served  the  Accusation  and  other 
 
required  documents  on  Respondents.  Respondents  thereafter  timely  filed  a  Notice  of  Defense, 
seeking  a  determination  of  whether  cause  exists  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  2010-2011 
school year.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
which may be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of Education Code section 44955.  
 
 
The  Governing  Board  took  action  to  reduce  the  services  set  forth  in  factual 
finding number 3 primarily because of the State budget crisis and the District's need to reduce or 
discontinue services in order to maintain a balanced budget and provide essential services. The 
decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  is  neither  arbitrary  nor 
capricious but is rather a proper exercise of the District's discretion. 
 
 
The reduction of services set forth in factual finding number 3, in the context of 
reductions necessitated by the anticipated cuts in State funding, is related to the welfare of the 
District  and  its  pupils,  and  it  has  become  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated 
employees as determined by the Governing Board. 
 
 
13.  After  the  adoption  of  Resolution  number  2009/2010-11,  the  District  received 
notice that two elementary school teachers would not be returning to the District for the 2010-

The services set forth in factual finding number 3 are particular kinds of services 

Respondents thereafter, through counsel, timely filed notices of defense. 

All prehearing jurisdictional requirements have been met.

2011 school year due to their resignation or retirement. As a result, the number of positions to be 
reduced was decreased by two full-time equivalent positions. The District therefore rescinded its 
reduction  in  force  notifications  as  to  Respondents  Florentino  Aleman  and  Frances  Reinosa 
(Reinosa).  It  was  determined  that  Reinosa  could,  pursuant  to  her  request,  job  share  0.6  of  a 
position for the 2010-2011 school year. As a result, on April 30, 2010, the District rescinded its 
reduction in force notification to Respondent Vanessa Plakias as to 0.4 FTE.   
 
The District properly considered all known attrition, resignations, and retirements 
 
in determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices to be delivered to its employees.  
(San Jose Teachers Assn. v. Allen (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627, 636.) 
 
 
The District maintains a seniority list which contains employees’ first day of paid 
service,  current  assignments,  and  credential  and  certificate  information.  The  District  properly 
created its seniority list by determining the first day of paid service of each certificated employee 
and  properly  utilized  reasonable  skipping  criteria  when  necessary.  The  skipping  criteria  were 
properly developed based on the needs of the District and its students.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

2. 

Jurisdiction  for  the  subject  proceeding  exists  pursuant  to  sections  44949  and 

 
 
44955, by reason of factual finding numbers 1-9. 
 
 
The District must be solvent to provide educational services, and cost savings 
are necessary to resolve its budget shortfall.  The Governing Board’s decision was a proper 
exercise of its discretion.  Financial considerations are an appropriate basis for a reduction in 
services  under  section  44955.    As  stated  in  San  Jose  Teachers  Association,  supra,  144 
Cal.App.3d at 638-639, the reduction of particular kinds of services on the basis of financial 
considerations  is  authorized  under  that  section,  and,  “in  fact,  when  adverse  financial 
circumstances  dictate  a  reduction  in  certificated  staff,  section  44955  is  the  only  statutory 
authority available to school districts to effectuate that reduction.” 
 
The services set forth in Factual Finding 3 are particular kinds of services within 
 
the  meaning  of  section  44955,  by  reason  of  factual  finding  numbers  3  and  10.    Specifically, 
elementary school classroom teaching is a particular kind of service under section 44955.  (Calif. 
Teachers Assn. v. Board of Trustees of Goleta Union School Dist. (1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 32, 36; 
San Jose Teachers Assn., supra, 144 Cal.App.3d at 637.)

Cause  exists  under  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  District  to  reduce  or 
 
discontinue  the  particular  kinds  of  services  set forth in factual finding number 3, which cause 
relates solely to the welfare of the District's schools and students, by reason of factual finding 
numbers 1-16. 
 
 
Cause exists to reduce the number of certificated employees of the District due to 
the  reduction  and  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services,  by  reason  of  factual  finding 
numbers 1-16 and legal conclusion numbers 1-4.  The District may give notice to Respondents 
Rosario Aronie, Amanda King, and Vanessa Plakias (as to 0.6 FTE only) that their services will 
not  be  required  for  the  2010-2011  school  year.    The  Accusation  shall  be  dismissed  as  to 
Respondents Florentino Aleman and Frances Reinosa. 
 

RECOMMENDATION

position during the 2010-2011 school year, due to the reduction of particular kinds of services.
