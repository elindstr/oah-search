Hearings, State of California, heard this matter on April 23, 2013, in San Ysidro, California.

Darren Kameya, Lozano & Smith, represented San Ysidro School District.

Jon Cadieux, Tosdal, Smith, Steiner & Wax, represented the respondents identified in

Appendix A.1

The matter was submitted on April 23, 2013.

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

On March 14, 2013, the Governing Board adopted Resolution No. 12/13-0003

reducing particular kinds of services and directing the superintendent to give appropriate
notices to certificated employees whose positions would be affected by the action. The
resolution identified 14 FTEs to be reduced. The decision to reduce or discontinue a particular
kind of service is matter reserved to the district’s discretion and is not subject to second-
guessing in this proceeding. (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees of Bellflower Unified School
District (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167.)

2.

Thereafter, on or about March 15, 2013, the superintendent gave written notice

to certificated employees, including respondents, of the recommendation that their services
would not be required for the 2013-14 school year. The reasons for the recommendation
were set forth in these preliminary layoff notices. Thereafter, an accusation was served on
each respondent listed on Appendix A. Each respondent is a certificated employee of the
district.

1

The parties stipulated that the district timely served all required jurisdictional
documents and that all respondents timely filed a request for hearing and a notice of defense.

3.

Prior to the start of the hearing the parties, after much diligent work, entered

into a second stipulation resolving all issues.2 The second stipulation provides the following:

a.

The District shall revise the seniority date for Chelsea Kuntz from

August 8, 2005, to September 13, 2004.

b.

The Application of Tiebreaking Criteria (Exhibit 3) accurately reflects
the application of the criteria contained in Governing Board Resolution #12/13-003.

c.

The layoff notices issued to Cynthia Mosequeda, Leonor Garcia,

Carmen Luna, Chelsea Kuntz, Diana Hernandez, Thomas Nunez and Blanca Castillo shall be
rescinded.

d.

Final layoff notices shall be issued to the respondents listed in

Appendix A.

The stipulation shall be non-precedential
proceedings and respondents reserve the right to challenge the Board’s skipping criteria.

in any future layoff

e.

f.

The stipulation shall not affect the respondents’ recall rights.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

2.

Jurisdiction for this proceeding exists pursuant to sections 44949 and 44955,

and all notices and other requirements of those sections have been provided as required.

A district may reduce services within the meaning of section 44955,

subdivision (b), “either by determining that a certain type of service to students shall not,
thereafter, be performed at all by anyone, or it may ‘reduce services’ by determining that
proffered services shall be reduced in extent because fewer employees are made available to
deal with the pupils involved.” (Rutherford v. Board of Trustees (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 167,
178-179.)

3.

A senior teacher whose position is discontinued has the right to transfer to a

continuing position which he or she is certificated and competent to fill. In doing so, the
senior employee may displace or “bump” a junior employee who is filling that position.
(Lacy v. Richmond Unified School District (1975) 13 Cal.3d 469, 473-474.) Junior teachers
may be given retention priority over senior teachers only if the junior teachers possess
superior skills or capabilities which their more senior counterparts lack. (Santa Clara
Federation of Teachers, Local 2393, v. Governing Board of Santa Clara Unified School
District (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 831, 842-843.)

That stipulation, inadvertently titled Stipulation #3, was marked and received as

2

Exhibit 2.

4.

Because of the reduction of particular kinds of services, cause exists pursuant
to Education Code section 44955 to give notice to respondents that their services will not be
required for the 2013-2014 school year. The cause relates solely to the welfare of the schools
and the pupils thereof within the meaning of Education Code section 44949. The district has
identified the certificated employees who are providing the particular kinds of services that
the Governing Board directed be reduced or discontinued. It is recommended that the
Governing Board give respondents notice before May 15, 2013, that their services will not be
required by the District for the 2013-14 school year.

RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that the governing board adopt the second stipulation (Exhibit 2) in

its entirety as its order in this proceeding.

DATED: April 29, 2013
