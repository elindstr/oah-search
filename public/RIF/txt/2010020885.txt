4. 

Respondents each filed a timely request for hearing to determine if there is 

Before March 15, 2010, Superintendent Moorehouse gave written notice to 16 

 
certificated employees, including the nine respondents, of the recommendation that their 
services will not be required for the 2010-2011 school year.  The reasons for the 
recommendation were set forth in these preliminary layoff notices. 
 
 
cause for terminating their services for the 2010-2011 school year.  (Six other employees did 
not file requests for hearing, and the district later rescinded the layoff notice for one 
employee who filed a request for hearing.)  An accusation was served on each respondent, 
and each of them filed a timely notice of defense.  All prehearing jurisdictional requirements 
have been met.

elementary level, physical education will be provided by classroom teachers rather than by a 
physical education teacher.  At the middle school and high school levels, there will be 
sufficient physical education teachers left to provide the minimum number of minutes of 
physical education per pupil.  Rather than employing a certificated librarian, the district will 
contract with the Humboldt County Office of Education for library services.2   
 
 
Hooper and Kendall Pickenpaugh were classified as permanent employees were resolved at 
the hearing.  These respondents apparently were initially hired into either a categorically-
funded position or into a position in the regular (district-funded) educational program held by 
an employee on assignment to a categorically-funded position.  In either case, such 
employment would not be counted toward permanent status unless certain requirements were 
met.  (Ed. Code, §§ 44909 & 44918.) 
 
 
No certificated employee junior in seniority to any respondent is being retained 
by the district to perform services that any respondent is certificated and competent to render.
