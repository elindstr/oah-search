3. 

Manual  H.  Paul  (Superintendent)  notified  the  Governing  Board  of  the  San 

Ysidro  School  District  (Board)  and  Respondents  that  he  recommended  that  notice  be  given  to 
Respondents  that  their  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

On  March  4,  2008,  the  Board  adopted  Resolution  number  07/08-0006  that  reduced  or 
eliminated  particular  kinds  of  services  for  the  ensuing  school  year  and  established  skipping 
and  tie-breaker  criteria. 

Respondents  were  served  on  or  before  March  15,  2008. 

The  written  notice  of  termination  stated  that  Respondents’  services  would  not  be 
required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  and  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation, 
The  recommendation  that  Respondents  be  terminated  from  employment  was  not  related  to 
competency.  In  addition,  the  notice  advised  Respondents  of  the  right  to  hearing,  that  the 
request  for  hearing  must  be  delivered  to  the  Superintendent’s  office  no  later  than  March  24, 
2008,  not  less  than  seven  days  after  the  date  the  notice  of  termination  was  served  and  that  the 
failure  to  request  a  hearing  would  constitute  waiver  of  the  right  to  a  hearing. 

Some,  but  not  all,  Respondents  filed  a  timely  Request  for  Hearing  and/or  Notice  of 

Defense.

An  Accusation  was  served  on  Respondents  in  a  timely  manner. 

All  prehearing  jurisdictional  requirements  were  satisfied. 

There  was  no  appearance  by  or  on  behalf  of  Respondents  Ana  Alvidrez,  Maria 

Canale,  Ann  Cardoza  or  Catalina  Jauregui. 

On  March  4,  2008,  the  Board  adopted  Resolution  number  07/08-0006  and  took 

action  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  following  particular  kinds  of  certificated  services

The  proposed  reductions  totaled  55.0  full-time  equivalent  (FTE)  positions. 

7. 

The  Assistant  Superintendent  was  responsible  for  implementing  the  technical 

aspects  of  the  layoff.  The  District  developed  a  Seniority  List  that  contained,  among  other 
matters,  the  employee’s  name,  seniority  date,  assignment,  credential,  authorization(s)  and 
classification  as  permanent  or  probationary. 

The  seniority  date  was  based  on  the  employee’s  first  date  of  paid  service  rendered  in  a 
probationary  capacity.”  A  teacher  hired  as  a  probationary  employee  who  worked  as  a 
substitute  or  temporary  employee  for  at  least  75  percent  of  the  school  days  during  the 
previous  year  and  had  performed  the  duties  normally  required  of  a  certificated  employee  of 
the  school  district  was  deemed  to  have  served  a  complete  school  year  as  a  probationary 
employee  if  employed  as  a  probationary  employee  the  following  school  year.  The  teacher 
was  entitled  to  have  that  earlier  year  counted  as  a  year  of  probationary  service.  The  prior 
year  was  “tacked”  on  for  seniority  purposes.’  Only  one  year  could  be  tacked. 

8. 

The  Assistant  Superintendent  made a diligent  effort  to  assure  the  accuracy  of 
the  seniority  date  and  credentials  on  file  for  each  member  of  the  District’s  certificated  staff. 
Among  other  things,  she

reviewed  and  researched  all  employee  records,  and 
provided  each  certificated  staff  member  with  written  notice  of  any  and  all 
credentials  that  the  District  had  on  file  for  said  employee  and  provided  said 
employees  an  opportunity  to  update  the  information. 

valid,  she  changed  the  District’s  records  for  the  certificated  employee.

; 

9. 

Respondent  Leonor  Partida  (Respondent  Partida)  disputed  the  credentials  and 

seniority  date  reported  in  the  seniority  list. 

In  addition  to  her  Multiple  Subject  Credential,  Single  Subject  Credential  in  Spanish 

and  CLAD,  Respondent  Partida  holds  an  Administrative  Credential  that  was  not  reflected  on 
the  seniority  list.  The  Assistant  Superintendent  explained  that  the  seniority  list  contained 
only  the  teaching  credentials,  not  all  credentials  on  file  with  the  District  or  held  by  the 
certificated  employee;  further,  the  Assistant  Superintendent  was  aware  that  Respondent 
Partida  holds  a  current  Administrative  Credential  and  he  believed  that  it  was  on  file  with  the 
district. 

Respondent  Partida  argued  that  her  seniority  date  should  be  changed  from  August  21, 

2002  to  August  23,  2002.  Respondent  Partida’s  first  date  of  paid  service  with  the  District 
was  March  1,  2001  as  a  vice-principal.  She  served  in  this  capacity  for  the  next  two  school 
years.  Respondent  Partida  became  a  classroom  teacher  on  August  23,  2005. 

Neither  the  recordation  of  her  administrative  credential  on  the  seniority  list  nor  the 

modification  of  her  seniority  date  impacted  whether  Respondent  Partida  should  have 
received a  layoff  notice,  although  that  might  be  relevant  to  her  rehire.  Whether  Respondent 
Partida’s  seniority  date  is  proper  is  not  an  issue  for  determination  in  this  proceeding. 

10.  |  Respondent  Sally  Del  Rio  (Respondent  Del  Rio)  asserted  that  her  seniority 

date  should  be  August  25,  1997,  her  first  date  of  paid  service  with  the  District,  not 
August  22,  2006,  the  date  reported  by  the  District  in  its  seniority  list. 

During  the  last  nine  years,  Respondent  Del  Rio  has  been  employed  by  the  District, 

she  has  had  breaks  in  service  for  medical  reasons.  There  was  no  evidence  that,  at  any  time, 
she  had  been  terminated  for  cause,  lack  of  enrollment,  discontinuance  of  service  or  otherwise 
interrupted  in  a  manner  declared  by  law  not  to  constitute  a  break  in  service. 

Most  recently,  after  exhaustion  of  her  sick  leave,  when  Respondent  Del  Rio  did  not 

return  to  work,  albeit  for  medical  reasons,  the  District  treated  her  separation  as  a  resignation. 
When  she  was  re-employed  within  39  months,  Respondent  Del  Rio  was  entitled  to  all  rights, 
benefits  and  burdens  of a permanent  employee,  except  as  otherwise  provided  in  the 
Education  Code.*  Because  the  Education  Code  section  44848°  governs  the  determination  of 
the  seniority  date of a  certificated  employee  who  leaves  the  District  and  is  re-employed, 
Respondent  Del  Rio’s  original  seniority  date  cannot  be  deemed  to  be  a  right  or  benefit  under 
Education  Code  section  44931. 

Education  Code  section  44931. 

Education  Code  section  44848  provides,  in  pertinent  part: 
“When  any  certificated  employee  shall  have  resigned  or  been  dismissed  for  cause  and  shall  thereafter  have 
been  reemployed  by  the  board,  his  date  of  employment  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the  date  on-which  he  first 
accepted  reemployment (if  reemployed  before  July  J,  1947)  or  rendered  paid  service  (if  reemployed  after 
June  30,  1947)  after  his  reemployment  . 

.  .” 

 

  

Given  the  foregoing,  the  District  properly  determined  Respondent  Del  Rio’s  seniority 

date  to  be  August  26,  2006,  the  date  that  she  was  reemployed.° 

11. 

In  compliance  with  Education  Code  section  44955,  subdivision  (d)(1),  by 

adoption  of  Resolution  No.  07/08-006,  dated  March  4,  2008,  the  Board  elected  to  skip  and 
retain  all  teachers  who  satisfied  the  skipping  criteria  set  forth  in  attached  Exhibit  “C.” 

12. 

Between  the  employees  who  first  rendered  paid  service  to  the  District  on  the 

same  date,  the  Board  determined  their  order  of  termination  solely  on  the  basis  of  the  needs  of 
the  District  and  its  students.  The  order  of  termination  is  based  on  the  needs  of  the  District 
and  its  students. 

13. 

The  services  that  the  District  proposed  to  reduce  were  “particular  kinds  of 

services”  that  can  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code  section 
44955.  The  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  these  particular  kinds  of  services  was 
not  arbitrary  or  capricious  but  constituted  a  proper  exercise  of  discretion. 

14. 

The  District’s  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services 
related  to  the  welfare  of  the  District  and  its  pupils.  The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of 
particular  kinds  of  services  was  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees 
of  the  District  as  determined  by  the  Board. 

15. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  to  any  Respondent  was  retained  to  perform 

any  services  which  any  Respondent  was  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

2. 

Jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 

44955.  All  notices and jurisdictional  requirements  contained  in  these  sections  are  satisfied. 

A  District  may  reduce  services  within  the  meaning  of  section  44955, 

subdivision  (b),  “either  by  determining  that  a  certain  type  of  service  to  students  shall  not  be 
performed  at  all  by  anyone,  or  it  may  ‘reduce  services’  by  determining  that  proffered 
services  shall  be  reduced  in  extent  because  fewer  employees  are  made  available  to  deal  with 
the  pupils  involved.”  (Rutherford  v.  Board of Trustees  (1976)  64  Cal.App.3d  167,  178-179.) 

3. 

Cause  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  San 

Ysidro  School  District  to  reduce  or  discontinue  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  cause  for 
the  reduction  or  discontinuance  of  particular  kinds  of  services  is  related  solely  to  the  welfare 
of  the  schools  and  the  pupils  thereof.

A  senior  teacher  whose  position  is  discontinued  has  the  right  to  transfer  to  a 

continuing  position  which  he/she  is  certificated  and  competent  to  fill. 
employee  may  displace  or  “bump”  a  junior  employee  who  is  filling  that  position.  (Lacy  v. 
Richmond  Unified  School  District  (1975)  13  Cal.  3d  469.) 

In  doing  so,  the  senior

Junior  teachers  may  be  given  retention  priority  over  senior  teachers  if  the 

junior  teachers  possess  superior  skills  or  capabilities  which  their  more  senior  counterparts 
lack.  (Poppers  v.  Tamalpais  Union  High  School  District  (1986)  184  Cal.App.3d  399;  Santa 
Clara  Federation  of  Teachers,  Local  2393  v.  Board  of Santa  Clara  Unified  School  District 
(1981)  116  Cal.App.3d  831.) 

6. 

No  employee  with  less  seniority  than  any  Respondent  is  being  retained  to 

render  a  service  which  any  Respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

ORDER 

1. 

The  Accusations  served  on  Respondents  listed  in  attached  Exhibit  “B”  are 

sustained.  Notice  shall  be  given  to  Respondents  before  May  15,  2008  that  their  services  will 
not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  or  discontinuance  of 
particular  kinds  of  services. 

2. 

Notice  shall  be  given  in  inverse  order  of  seniority.

EXHIBIT  “C” 
“SKIPPING  CRITERIA” 

The  District  shall  retain  certificated  employees,  regardless of  their  seniority  (unless  the 
employee  is  bumped  by  a  more  senior  and  competent  employee),  to  the  extent  one  or  more  of 
their  assignments  meet  any  of  the  following  criteria: 

1.  Employees  who  possess  an  active  special  education  credential,  are  expected  to 

teach  one  or  more  special  education  classes  in  the  2008-2009  school  year  and  are 
deemed  “highly  qualified”  per  the  federal  No  Child  Left  Behind  Act  . 

2.  Employees  who  possess  an  active  Pupil  Personnel  Services  Credential,  are 

working  in  a  school  counselor  position  and  are  expected  to  work  as  a  school 
counselor  in  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

3.  Employees  who  possess  an  active  Pupil  Personnel  Services  Credential,  are 

working  in  a  school  psychologist  position  and  are  expected  to  work  as  a  school 
psychologist  in  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

Employees  who  meet  any  of  the  foregoing  criteria  for  some  but  not  all  of  their  assignment(s) 
shall  be  retained  only  as  to  that  portion  of  their  assignment(s)  in  2008-2009  that  meets  the 
foregoing  criteria. 

The  Superintendent  or  his/her  designee  is  authorized  to  determine  which  employees  qualify 
to  be  “skipped”  from  the  Reduction  in  Force  and  to  determine  the  manner  in  which  the 
foregoing  criteria  shall  be  applied  to  each  employee.
