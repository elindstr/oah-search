The reductions adopted by the Board’s resolution totaled 144 FTE positions.  

Of the total number of FTE’s reduced, 18 FTE’s were reduced in categorically funded 
temporary services.  The Board resolution stated with respect to the categorically funded 
temporary services as follows:  “Inclusion of categorically funded services within this 
Resolution is not intended to grant those individuals who are impacted any rights greater than 
provided by law, nor to nullify any provisions within each impacted individual’s 
employment contract, nor to supersede any other Resolution by this Governing Board to 
release or otherwise terminate the services of any impacted individual.”  
 

6. 

The Board directed the Superintendent or his designee to determine which

On or before March 15, 2010, the District timely served, by either personal 

On or before March 15, 2010, the Assistant Superintendent notified the Board 

employees’ services would not be required for the 2010-2011 school year as a result of the 
reduction of these particular kinds of services.  The Board further directed the Superintendent 
or his designee to send the appropriate notices to all certificated employees of the District 
who would be laid off as a result of the reduction of these particular kinds of services.  On 
March 11, 2010, the Superintendent executed a Non-Exclusive Delegation of Authority 
designating the Assistant Superintendent as the District administrator charged with 
implementing the layoff.           
 
 
of the District’s intent to issue preliminary layoff notices.   
 
 
delivery or by registered mail, a written notice to each of the respondents herein that the 
Superintendent had recommended not to re-employ them in the upcoming 2010-2011 school 
year.  The written notice notified respondents that his or her services would not be required 
for the upcoming 2010-2011 school year.  The written notice to respondents set forth the 
reasons for the recommendation.  Each written notice advised respondents of their right to a 
hearing, that each respondent had to deliver a Request for Hearing in writing to the District 
by March 24, 2010, and that the failure to deliver a Request a Hearing would constitute the 
waiver of the right to a hearing.  The recommendation that respondents be terminated from 
employment was not related to their job performance as teachers.   
 
 
employed for the ensuing school year did not file a Request for Hearing.  However, each of 
the 158 respondents named in Exhibit A to the accusation herein timely filed a written 
Request for Hearing to determine if there is cause for not reemploying them for the 2010-
2011 school year.   
 

Some certificated employees given written notice that they would not be re-

10. 

Subsequently, on March 11, 2010, the District filed and then timely served the 
Accusation dated March 11, 2010, a Notice to Respondent, a blank Notice of Defense form, 
a Notice of Hearing, and relevant Education Code and Government Code sections, upon each 

 

3

of the 158 respondents listed in Exhibit A to the accusation herein who had timely requested 
a hearing in this matter.  142 of the named respondents herein filed a timely Notice of 
Defense and a Request for Hearing.  Respondents Pamela Barret, Megan Coursol, Karina 
Curl, Nicole Downer, Jaime Gaines, Megan Haley, Lauri Hatcher, Stephanie James, Mark 
Ketchem, Adrienne Leal, Craig Miller, Sharon Riddle, Jessica Ruiz, Sharon Russell, Kari 
Sanchez, and Brent Wells did not submit a timely submit a Notice of Defense requesting a 
hearing in this matter.   

 
11.  All pre-hearing jurisdictional requirements were met by the District. 

  

12. 

The services the Board addressed in the Resolution to Reduce Services are 
“particular kinds of services” that can be reduced or discontinued within the meaning of 
Education Code section 44955.  The Board’s decision to reduce or discontinue these 
particular kinds of services was not arbitrary or capricious, but constituted a proper and 
reasonable exercise of its discretion.  The Board’s decision to make these cuts was the result 
of deliberation and consideration of the necessary cuts in the District’s budget for the ensuing 
school year.  The District is facing a significant budget deficit in the next school year.  The 
Board’s action to reduce services is a proper exercise of its discretion to address the need for 
budget cuts for the 2010-2011 school year.   

 
13. 

 
14. 

 
15. 

 
The reduction or discontinuation of particular kinds of services relates solely 
to the welfare of the District and its pupils.  The District faces extremely difficult financial 
times due to the current state budget crisis.  While it may not be desirable to cut back staff, 
the District is facing a grave financial situation in the coming year.  The reduction or 
discontinuation of particular kinds of services was necessary to decrease the number of 
certificated employees of the District as determined by the Board. 
 

Some of the employees named as respondents were hired on the same date.  

Between these employees who first rendered paid service to the district on the same date, the 
Board determined their order of termination solely on the basis of needs of the district and 
the students.  The specific criteria used to determine the order of termination was set forth by 
the Board in Resolution No. 1959 Resolution to Adopt Criteria For Resolving Ties in 
Seniority Related To Certificated Layoffs (Tie Breaking Criteria).  The specific criteria to be 
used are set forth in the Tie Breaking Criteria.  The District fairly applied the Tie Breaking 
Criteria to rank those employees hired on the same date.  Under these criteria the District 
properly retained certain employees while the respondents were properly given notice that 
their services would no longer be required for the ensuing school year.  

Subsequent to the Board action and filing and service of the accusations, the 
District worked with the Hemet Teachers’ Association (the Association) to further evaluate 
personnel needs in the District in an effort to reduce the number of respondents that would 
need to be given final layoff notices.  The District and the Association entered into a 
tentative agreement that now enables the District to significantly reduce the number of layoff 
notices that need to be delivered to its employees.  The District has reduced the number of 
necessary layoff notices to the 26 employees who are listed in Exhibit B attached hereto.  

 

4

The District will be releasing an additional nine temporary employees who are working in 
services being reduced without the need to issue them a final layoff notice.   

 
16. 

The Board considered all known attrition, resignations, and retirements in 

determining the actual number of necessary layoff notices to be delivered to its employees. 
 

17. 

Some of the respondents at the hearing raised individual factual issues as to 

their particular circumstances as follows: 

 
Respondent Jason Luna (Luna) asserted at the hearing that he might have been able to 

displace or “bump” another teacher to move into a position that is not being reduced.  He 
claims he would have been credentialed and competent to teach in that position because last 
year he had a board authorization to teach the subject.  However, Luna’s board authorization 
was for one year only.  He did not have the same board authorization to teach the subject this 
school year and therefore he did not qualify under the terms of the Resolution to Reduce 
Services that defined “competency” under Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b).        
 

Respondent Andre Williams (Williams) is a counselor.  Williams asserted at the 
hearing that he should be able to bump another less senior employee to move into a position 
that is not being reduced.  He is credentialed to teach special education and he claims he 
taught special education for one year during the last five years in another state which would 
qualify him under the board’s Resolution to Reduce Services as competent to teach in that 
area under Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b).  The District did consider this 
experience, but Williams taught special education for only one semester in the last five years 
which does not satisfy the competency standard.     

 
Respondent Michelle Serrano (Serrano) shares the same date of first paid service with 

numerous other employees and she asserted at the hearing that tie breaker criteria should 
have taken into consideration that the only reason she did not have the same experience 
teaching a particular course was due to scheduling in the last year.  However, the District 
properly applied the tie breaker criteria in the order designated by the Board.     
 

Respondent Chonalyn Guilas (Guilas) shares the same date of first paid service with 
numerous other employees and she asserted at the hearing that her prior teaching experience 
should have broken the tie in her favor.  However, the District properly applied the tie 
breaker criteria in the order designated by the Board and the tie between Guilas and others 
was broken at the point of determining the date Guilas obtained her Master’s Degree so her 
other teaching experience was no longer relevant.      
 
 
hearing that they had credentials and experience that would potentially qualify them to bump 
a less senior employee to move into a position that is not being reduced.  However, prior to 
March 15, 2010, the District sent all the employees possibly slated for layoff, including Finn 
and Ream, a verification of each employee’s seniority information asking that each employee 
either verify the information as correct or notify the District of any appropriate corrections.  

Respondents Rebekah Finn (Finn) and Andrew Ream (Ream) both asserted at the 

 

5

Finn and Ream both returned their verifications indicating that all the information the 
District had was correct.  In Ream’s case, his credential was actually cleared on March 9, 
2010, but he did not notify the District until March 18, 2010.  The District is entitled to rely 
on the verification from the employee sent in before March 15, 2010 so that the District may 
accurately determine the order of layoff and send out the notices of layoff by March 15, 2010 
as required by law.     
 

 

Respondent Anna Cadle (Cadle) asserted at the hearing that she should be 

higher on the seniority list.  However, Cadle is not being laid off by the District so the issue 
of her order on the seniority list is not at issue in this proceeding. 
  

Respondent Colleen Sanden (Sanden) asserted at the hearing that she worked as an 
hourly employee and was not sure she should have been working as an hourly employee.  
However, this issue of whether or not Sanden was properly employed as an hourly employee 
is not an issue in this proceeding and does not change the order of layoff.   
 

Respondent David Kirkendall asserted at the hearing that he is concerned that 

counselors are being reduced while there is a great need for counselors in the District.  
However, this concern, while a valid concern, is not at issue in this proceeding and does not 
change the order of layoff.   
 

18.  No certificated employee junior to any respondent is being retained to perform 

any services which any respondent is certificated and competent to render.  The Board 
appropriately set forth the criteria to determine whether an employee is deemed “competent” 
to render services, within its discretion, as part of the Resolution to Reduce Services and the 
District properly applied those criteria.        
 
 

 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction in this matter exists under Education Code sections 44949 and 

 
 
44955.  All notices and jurisdictional requirements contained in those sections were satisfied. 
 
 
Unified School District to reduce particular kinds of services.  The cause for the reduction of 
particular kinds of services is related solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils 
thereof.   
 

Cause exists under Education Code section 44949 and 44955 for the Hemet 

2. 

3.
