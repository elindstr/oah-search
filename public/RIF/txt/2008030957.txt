FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

David  Alvarez,  the  Superintendent  of  the  Calexico  Unified  School  District, 

made  and  filed  the  accusation  herein  in  his  official  capacity  as  the  Superintendent,  Calexico 
Unified  School  District.  The  accusation  was  filed  against  the  22  respondents  (respondents) 
identified  in  Attachment  A  attached  hereto  and  incorporated  herein. 

2. 

The  respondents  are  all  certificated  employees  of  the  Calexico  Unified  School 

e 

District  (the  District). 

3. 

On  March  11,  2008,  in  accordance  with  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 
44955,  the  Superintendent  of  the  District  notified  the  Governing  Board  of  the  District  (the 
Board)  in  writing  of  his  recommendation  that  notice  should  be  given  to  respondents  that  their 

  
1

services  would  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  The  Superintendent  stated  the 
reasons  for  the  recommendation.  The  Superintendent  recommended  the  reduction  of 
particular  kinds  of  services  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

4, 

On  March  11,  2008,  the  Board  adopted  Resolution  No.  16-03-08  determining 
that  it  is  necessary  to  reduce  particular  kinds  of  services  at  the  end  of  the  current  school  year. 
The  Board  determined  that  the  particular  kinds  of  services  that  must  be  reduced  for  the  2008- 
2009  school  year  are  the  following  full  time  equivalent  (FTE)  positions: 

Particular  Kinds  of  Services 

Number  of  FTE  Positions 

Elementary  School  Teachers 

Single  Subject  Social  Science 

Adult  Education 

Continuation  High  School 

Psychologist 

13  FTE 

3  FTE 

9  FTE 

2  FTE 

-S  FTE 

These  reductions  adopted  by  Board’s  resolution  16-03-08  totaled  27.50  FTE  positions. 

5. 

Subsequently,  on  March  13,  2008,  the  Board  adopted  an  additional  Resolution 
determining  that  it  is  necessary  to  reduce  an  additional  particular  kind  of  service  at  the  end  of 
the  current  school  year.  The  Board  determined  that  the  additional  particular  kind  of  service 
that  must  be  reduced  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  is  the  following  full  time  equivalent 
(FTE)  positions: 

Particular  Kinds  of  Services 

Number  of  FTE  Positions 

Counselor 

.5  FTE 

The  final  total  reductions  adopted  by  the  Board’s  two  resolutions  are  28.0  FTE  positions. 

6. 

The  Board  directed  the  Superintendent  or  his  designee  to  determine  which 

employees’  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  2008-2009  school  year  as  a  result  of  the 
reduction  of  these  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  Board  further  directed  the  Superintendent 
to  send  the  appropriate  notices  to  all  certificated  employees  of  the  District  who  would  be  laid 
off  as  a  result  of  the  reduction  of  these  particular  kinds  of  services. 

7. 

Based  on  the  plan  to  reduce  particular  kinds  of  services  by  a  total  of  28  FTE 
positions,  the  District  determined  it  needed  to  give  notice  to  29  certificated  employees  that 
their  services  would  be  terminated  for  the  upcoming  school  year. 

 

8. 

Thereafter,  the  District  continued  to  evaluate  personnel  needs  in  the  District. 

Since  the  Board’s  action,  after  taking  into  consideration  upcoming  positively  assured 
attrition,  resignations,  and  retirements,  the  District  has  now  determined  it  can  meet  its  fiscal 
needs  by  reducing  services  by  a total  of  22  FTE  positions  for  the  2008-2009  school  year.  To 
accomplish  this  reduction  of  services,  the  District  needs  to  give  final  notices  of  termination 
to  the  22  certificated  employees,  all  of  whom  are  respondents  in  this  proceeding. 

9. 

On  or  before  March  15,  2008,  the  District  timely  served  a  written  notice  on 

each  of  the  respondents  herein  that  the  Superintendent  of  the  District  had  recommended  not 
to  re-employ  them  in  the  upcoming  2008-2009  school  year.  The  written  notice  notified 
respondents  that  his  or  her  services  would  not  be  required  for  the  upcoming  2008-2009 
school  year.  The  written  notice  to  respondents  set  forth  the  reasons  for  the  recommendation. 
The  recommendation  that  respondents  be  terminated  from  employment  was  not  related  to 
their  competency  as  teachers. 

10. 

Each  of  the  respondents  named  herein  timely  filed  a  written  Request  for 

Hearing  to  determine  if  there  is  cause  for  not  reemploying  them  for  the  2008-2009  school 
year. 

11. 

Subsequently,  the  District  filed  and  then  timely  served  the  Accusation  herein, 
a Notice  to  Respondent,  a  blank  Notice  of  Defense  form,  and  relevant  Education  Code  and 
Government  Code  sections,  upon  each  of  the  22  respondents  herein  who  had  timely 
requested  a  hearing  on  this  matter.  Thereafter,  all  but  five  of  the  respondents  herein  filed  a 
timely  Notice  of  Defense.  The  respondents  who  failed  to  file  a  timely  Notice  of  Defense 
were:  Thomas  Drake,  Rodrigo  Figueroa,  Eliza  Pereda,  Yordan  Rivera,  and  Karla  Valdez. 
The  District  declined  to  waive  this  time  requirement  as  to  these  five  employees  and  therefore 
these  five  respondents  did  not  participate  in  this  proceeding. 

12. 

At  the  hearing,  the  District  moved  to  dismiss  two  named  respondents  Maria 
Elena  Paola  Sanchez-Romero  and  Yordan  Rivera  because  they  are  employed  as  university 
interns.  Although  the  District  included  them  initially  on  the  list  of  respondents,  it  moved  for 
dismissal  of  these  two  respondents  since  Education  Code  section  44464  clearly  provides  that 
the  rights  given  under  Education  Code  sections  44498  and  44494  to  the  proceeding  herein 
are  not  afforded  to  interns.  The  District’s  motion  was  granted  at  the  hearing.  The  list  of  the 
20  remaining  respondents  is  identified  in  Attachment  B  and  incorporated  herein. 

All  pre-hearing  jurisdictional  requirements  were  met  by  the  District. 

13. 

14. 

The  services  the  Board  addressed  in  Resolution  No.  17-03-08  are  “particular 

kinds  of  services”  that  can  be  reduced  or  discontinued  within  the  meaning  of  Education  Code 
section  44955.  The  Board’s  decision  to  reduce  or  discontinue  these  particular  kinds  of 
services  was  not  arbitrary  or  capricious,  but  constituted  a  proper  and  reasonable  exercise  of 
its  discretion.  The  Board’s  action  was  taken  after  input  and  evaluation  from  administrative 
staff  of  the  District.  The  reductions  of  service  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  performance  of 
the  certificated  employees.  This  was a  difficult  decision  for  the  District  to  have  to  make,  but 
it  was  necessary  due  to  budgetary  constraints.  The  Board’s  decision  to  make  these  cuts  was 

  

3

the  result  of  consideration of the  necessary  cuts  in  the  District’s  budget  for  the  ensuing 
school  year.  The  Board’s  action  to  reduce  services  is  a  proper  exercise  of  its  discretion  to 
address  the  need  for  budget  cuts  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

15. 

The  District  currently  provides  adult  education  to  the  community,  but  the 
Board  decided  that  9  FTE  positions  in  adult  education  will  be  reduced  in  the  next  school 
year.  The  District  has  not  yet  determined  how,  if  at  all,  it  will  continue  to  provide  adult 
education  next  year.  The  District  would  not  be  permitted  to  layoff  employees  based  on  a 
reduction  of  particular  kinds  of  services  if  the  District  is  in  fact  going  to  continue  that 
identical  kind  and  level  of  service  next  year.  However,  the  District  does  not  plan  to  continue 
the  adult  education  services  in  the  same  method  or  manner  next  year.  The  District  is  hopeful 
it  will  still  be  able  to  provide  this  community  service  in  some  other  form,  but  at  this  time  it 
has  properly  determined  that  adult  education  services  will  be  reduced  by  9  FTE  positions  for 
the  next  school  year. 

16. 

The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  particular  kinds  of  services  relates  solely 
to  the  welfare of the  District  and  its  pupils.  The  District  clearly  recognizes  the  high  level  of 
dedication  and  service  these  respondents  have  given  to  the  District,  but  it  faces  difficult 
financial  times  due  to  proposed  state  budget  cuts. 
In  no  event,  will  these  reductions  result  in 
a  reduction  of  services  below  that  of  any  state  mandates.  The  reduction  or  discontinuation  of 
particular  kinds  of  services  was  necessary  to  decrease  the  number  of  certificated  employees 
of  the  District  as  determined  by  the  Board. 

17. 

The  Board  considered  all  positively  assured  attrition,  resignations,  retirements 

and  requests  for  transfer  in  determining  the  actual  number  of  necessary  layoff  notices  to  be 
delivered  to  its  employees. 

18. 

No  certificated  employee  junior  to  any  respondent  is  being  retained  to  perform 

any  services  which  any  respondent  is  certificated  and  competent  to  render. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

Jurisdiction  in  this  matter  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and 

44955.  All  notices  and  jurisdictional  requirements  contained  in  those  sections  were  satisfied. 

2. 

Cause  exists  under  Education  Code  sections  44949  and  44955  for  the  Calexico 
Unified  School  District  to  reduce  particular  kinds  of  services.  The  cause  for  the  reduction  of 
particular  kinds  of  services  is  related  solely  to  the  welfare  of  the  schools  and  the  pupils 
thereof.  A  preponderance  of  the  evidence  sustained  the  charges  set  forth  in  the  accusations 
herein.  Therefore,  cause  exists  for  the  Board  to  give  respondents  notice  before  May  15,  2008, 
that  their  services  will  no  longer  be  required  by  the  District  for  the  2008-2009  school  year. 

 

  

ORDER 

The  accusations  served  on  respondents  herein  are  sustained  and  notice  shall  be  given 
to  the  20  respondents  listed  in  Attachment  B  before  May  15,  2008  that  their  services  will  not 
be  required  in  the  next  school  year  because  of  the  reduction  of  particular  services  as 
indicated.
