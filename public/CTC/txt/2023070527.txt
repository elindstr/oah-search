SUMMARY 

Complainant seeks to deny respondent’s application for a Certificate of 

Clearance because she suffered multiple alcohol-related criminal convictions between 

2008 and 2019. Complainant established by a preponderance of the evidence 

respondent’s 2019 and 2015 driving under the influence (DUI) convictions were acts of 

moral turpitude related to respondent’s fitness to teach. Respondent demonstrated 

significant rehabilitation; however, more time is required for respondent to 

demonstrate her fitness to teach. Her application is denied.

Respondent’s Criminal Convictions 

2019 DUI CONVICTION 

5. 

On September 5, 2019, in the Superior Court of California, County of Los 

Angeles, case number 9WC03861, respondent was convicted upon her plea of no 

contest of violating Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (b), driving with a blood-

alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or higher, a misdemeanor. Respondent also 

admitted an allegation pursuant to Vehicle Code section 23578 that her blood-alcohol 

concentration was 0.15 percent or higher. 

6. 

The court placed respondent on summary probation for four years under 

terms and conditions including serving 64 days in county jail, completing an 18-month 

alcohol treatment program, paying court fees totaling $418, completing the Hospital 

and Morgue program, completing the Victim Impact Program of Mothers Against 

Drunk Driving, and installing an ignition interlock device on her vehicle for one year. 

7. 

At respondent’s sentencing hearing, the court advised respondent that 

being under the influence of alcohol, drugs or both impairs her ability to safely 

operate a motor vehicle and that it is extremely dangerous to human life to drive while 

under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or both. The court further advised respondent 

that if, as a result of her driving, someone is killed, she can be charged with murder. 

Respondent had received the same advisement, known as the Watson advisement, 

after her 2015, 2009, and 2008 DUI convictions. 

8. 

The facts and circumstances underlying respondent’s 2019 DUI 

conviction occurred on April 4, 2019, when she drove her vehicle on Interstate 10 while 

under the influence of alcohol. At about 1:22 a.m., California Highway Patrol (CHP) 

officers observed respondent driving her vehicle in an area closed for construction, 

3 

weaving between lanes. Officers conducted a traffic stop and noted respondent 

smelled like alcohol. While additional officers were en route to conduct a DUI 

investigation, respondent fell asleep in her vehicle. After she failed to successfully 

perform Field Sobriety Tests (FSTs), officers arrested her for DUI. At the CHP office, she 

provided two breath samples with readings of 0.26 and 0.25 percent blood-alcohol 

concentration. Respondent told officers she was extremely depressed and suicidal and 

went out drinking because she wanted to die. The officers sent respondent to a 

hospital for evaluation. 

9. 

At the time of her 2019 DUI offense, respondent was on summary 

probation for a 2015 DUI offense. On September 5, 2019, the court found respondent 

in violation of her probation and sentenced her to 120 days in county jail, to be served 

concurrently with the 64-day sentence for her 2019 DUI offense. 

2015 DUI CONVICTION 

10.  On October 20, 2015, in the Superior Court of California, County of Los 

Angeles, case number 5PS25532, respondent was convicted upon her plea of guilty of 

violating Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (b), driving with a blood-alcohol 

concentration of 0.08 percent or higher, a misdemeanor. Respondent also admitted an 

allegation pursuant to Vehicle Code section 23578 that her blood-alcohol 

concentration was 0.15 percent or higher. 

11. 

The court placed respondent on summary probation for five years under 

terms and conditions including serving 120 days in county jail, completing an 18-

month alcohol treatment program, paying $2,797 in fines and fees, completing the 

Hospital and Morgue program, completing the Victim Impact Program of Mothers 

Against Drunk Driving, and installing an ignition interlock device on her vehicle. 

4 

12. 

The facts and circumstances underlying respondent’s 2015 DUI 

conviction occurred on February 7, 2015, when she drove her vehicle on Interstate 215 

while under the influence of alcohol. A CHP officer observed respondent’s vehicle 

moving erratically within its lane. The officer conducted a traffic stop and noted 

respondent smelled like alcohol. After she failed to successfully perform FSTs, the 

officer arrested her for DUI. At a nearby police station, she provided two breath 

samples with readings of 0.21 and 0.20 percent blood-alcohol concentration. 

2015 PUBLIC INTOXICATION CONVICTION 

13.  On September 24, 2015, in the Superior Court of California, County of 

San Bernardino, case number 76506TG, respondent was convicted upon her plea of 

guilty of violating Penal Code section 647, subdivision (f), public intoxication, a 

misdemeanor. 

14. 

The court ordered respondent to pay a $440 fine and did not place her 

on probation. 

15. 

The facts and circumstances underlying respondent’s 2015 public 

intoxication conviction occurred on July 2, 2015, when respondent attended an 

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting while intoxicated and damaged a church 

restroom. After respondent damaged the restroom, a witness called the police, who 

arrived and observed respondent was under the influence of alcohol. She was swaying 

from side to side and could not stand without assistance. The officers arrested her for 

public intoxication.

2009 DUI CONVICTION 

16.  On January 26, 2009, in the Superior Court of California, County of San 

Bernardino, case number TVI801907, respondent was convicted upon her plea of guilty 

of violating Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (b), driving with a blood-alcohol 

concentration of 0.08 percent or higher, a misdemeanor. 

17. 

The court placed respondent on summary probation for three years 

under terms and conditions including serving 45 days in county jail, completing an 

alcohol treatment program, and paying fines and fees totaling $1738. 

18. 

The facts and circumstances underlying respondent’s 2009 DUI 

conviction occurred on June 1, 2008, when respondent drove a vehicle while under the 

influence of alcohol. The evidence did not disclose further details of the offense. 

Neither party submitted a police report regarding the incident. 

2008 DUI CONVICTION 

19.  On February 19, 2008, in the Superior Court of California, County of San 

Bernardino, case number TVA800192, respondent was convicted upon her plea of 

guilty of violating Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (b), driving with a blood-

alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or higher, a misdemeanor. 

20. 

The court placed respondent on summary probation for three years 

under terms and conditions including serving one day in jail, paying fines and fees 

totaling $1665, and completing a nine-month alcohol treatment program. 

21. 

The facts and circumstances underlying respondent’s 2008 DUI 

conviction occurred on October 20, 2007, when she drove her vehicle while under the 

influence of alcohol. A Rialto police officer observed respondent’s vehicle drift 

6 

between lanes and nearly collide with the curb. The vehicle stopped abruptly and then 

drove away at a speed well below the speed limit. The officer conducted a traffic stop 

and noted respondent smelled like alcohol. Respondent could not walk or stand 

without assistance, and the officer opined she could not safely attempt FSTs. The 

officer placed respondent under arrest for DUI. 

Respondent’s Evidence 

22. 

Respondent has worked for the Ontario-Montclair School District 

(Ontario-Montclair) since 2012 and worked with various other school districts 

beginning in 2000 when she was 17 years old. She began as an instructional aide at 

Ontario-Montclair and is now a Registered Behavior Technician, working with children 

who have behavioral issues. 

23. 

Respondent has been sober since February 15, 2020, the day after her 

brother was killed during an encounter with police officers while he was intoxicated. 

She attends AA meetings three times a week and speaks to her sponsor several times a 

week. Respondent testified the death of her brother was her “breaking point” and “we 

both died that night, but I had a chance to be reborn.” Respondent stated she will 

never drink again because alcohol “took something from [her] that [she] can’t get 

back.” 

24. 

In a letter dated August 23, 2022, Andrea D. Heitz, a licensed clinical 

social worker, vouched for respondent’s commitment to sobriety. She wrote, 

“[respondent] has gained a lot of insight about what [led] to her drinking and has been 

working diligently to make behavioral and emotional changes which supports her 

sober lifestyle.” (Ex. 3, p. A46.) Since December 2020, respondent has worked with Ms. 

7 

Heitz on a monthly or semi-monthly basis as part of the Kaiser Permanente Chemical 

Dependency Recovery Program. 

25. 

In a letter dated August 28, 2022, Giuliana Zlatar, Ph.D., vouched for 

respondent’s commitment to sobriety and her desire to serve others. Dr. Zlatar wrote, 

“[respondent] has a strong support group, of which I am part, and is relentless in 

wanting to remain engaged in finding ways to further grow and expand her 

possibilities.” (Ex. 3, p. A45.) Since September 2020, respondent has attended weekly 

therapy sessions with Dr. Zlatar to address mental health issues, including the trauma 

she experienced after her brother’s death. 

26. 

Respondent testified she complied with all the terms and conditions of 

her criminal probation for her 2019 DUI conviction. Her summary probation is 

scheduled to terminate on September 5, 2023. 

27. 

Respondent demonstrated a sincere commitment to her sobriety and 

rebuilding her life to focus on helping children. She testified she is an alcoholic and AA 

is her cure. She acknowledged her lengthy criminal history and conceded she was a 

selfish and destructive person before becoming sober. Respondent agreed she was 

previously not suitable for a Certificate of Clearance. However, she asserted she has 

since completely changed her life and the Commission should not hold her past 

against her, stating “a person should be allowed to change and rebuild themselves and 

become a contributor to society and this world.” Respondent applied for a Certificate 

of Clearance because she planned to become a school psychologist. She has since 

changed her plans to focus on becoming a school administrator.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

Burden and Standard of Proof 

1. 

Respondent has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the 

evidence that she is entitled to the certificate she seeks. (Breakzone Billiards v. City of 

Torrance (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1221; Evid. Code, § 115.) “Preponderance of the 

evidence” means evidence that has more convincing force than that opposed to it. 

(People ex rel. Brown v. Tri-Union Seafoods, LLC (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1549, 1567.) 

Applicable Law 

2. 

Under Education Code section 44000 et seq., and California Code of 

Regulations, title 5 (CCR), section 80000 et seq., the Commission is responsible for 

credentialing teachers in public schools in California, including taking adverse action 

against applicants and credential holders. “Adverse action” includes the denial of an 

application for a credential. (Ed. Code, § 44000.5; CCR, § 80300, subd. (a).) 

3. 

The Commission may deny an application for a credential if the applicant 

(1) is addicted to the use of intoxicating beverages to excess or (2) has committed any 

act involving moral turpitude. Any denial must be based upon reasons related to the 

applicant’s fitness to teach. (Ed. Code, § 44345, subds. (c), (e).) 

4. 

The Commission set forth factors to consider in determining the 

relationship between an applicant’s misconduct and their fitness, competence, or 

ability to perform the duties authorized by the credential. The factors, also known as 

the Morrison factors, include the likelihood the conduct may have adversely affected 

students, fellow teachers, or the educational community and the degree of impact; the 

proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct; the type of certificate held or applied 

9 

for; the extenuating or aggravating circumstances surrounding the conduct; the 

praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the motives resulting in the conduct; the 

probability that the questioned conduct will recur; the extent to which adverse action 

may have a chilling effect upon the constitutional rights of the person involved or on 

other certificated persons; and the publicity or notoriety given to the conduct. (CCR, § 

80302; see also Morrison v. State Board of Education (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 224–225.) 

Cause to Deny Respondent’s Application 

ALCOHOL ADDICTION 

5. 

Complainant seeks to deny respondent’s application because she is 

addicted to the use of intoxicating beverages to excess. 

6. 

Complainant did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence 

respondent is addicted to the use of intoxicating beverages to excess. The evidence 

clearly established respondent abused alcohol for many years, from at least 2007 

through 2019. However, respondent credibly testified she has been sober since 

February 15, 2020, after her brother’s death. Respondent’s testimony was corroborated 

by letters from her Kaiser social worker and her therapist, Dr. Zlatar. Although 

respondent still considers herself an alcoholic, she is not currently addicted to alcohol 

because she treats her alcoholism and maintains her sobriety through participation in 

therapy and AA. Cause therefore does not exist to deny respondent’s application 

pursuant to Education Code section 44345, subdivision (c). 

ACTS OF MORAL TURPITUDE 

7. 

Complainant seeks to deny respondent’s application because she 

engaged in acts of moral turpitude. 

10 

Definition 

8. 

Moral turpitude means an act of “baseness, vileness or depravity.” (In re 

Craig (1938) 12 Cal.2d 93, 97.) 

9. 

Some crimes, such as those involving an intent to defraud or “extremely 

repugnant” crimes such as murder, are always acts of moral turpitude. Other crimes, 

such as DUI, are not acts of moral turpitude unless the specific circumstances 

surrounding the crime or conviction establish moral turpitude exists. (In re Kelley 

(1990) 52 Cal.3d 487, 494 (Kelley).) In Kelley, the court found an attorney’s second DUI 

conviction, suffered while still on probation for the first DUI conviction, was not an act 

of moral turpitude. Similarly, the court also held an attorney’s two DUI convictions 

suffered in two consecutive years did not involve acts of moral turpitude. (In re Carr 

(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1089.) 

10. 

A fourth DUI offense within a seven-year period is an act of moral 

turpitude because it is “a recidivist type crime involving an extremely dangerous 

activity.” (People v. Forster (1994) 29 Cal. App.4th 1746, 1756 (Forster).) A person with 

three previous DUI convictions is “presumptively aware of the life-threatening nature 

of the activity and the grave risks involved.” (Ibid.) Driving under the influence despite 

such knowledge involves moral turpitude because it is indicative of “conscious 

indifference” or an “’I don’t care’ attitude” toward the consequences of the activity. 

(Ibid.) The felony DUI statute discussed in Forster, Vehicle Code section 23175, was 

superseded in 2011 by Vehicle Code section 23550, which classified a fourth DUI 

offense within ten years as a felony. 

/// 

/// 

11 

Analysis 

11. 

Applying the case law discussed above, respondent’s 2019 and 2015 DUI 

offenses were acts of moral turpitude because they were recidivist conduct involving 

an extremely dangerous activity. Although respondent’s four DUI offenses were not 

committed within 10 years of each other and therefore none was a felony, respondent 

was well aware of the dangers of driving while under the influence of alcohol. Her 

repeated disregard for public safety rendered her conduct acts of moral turpitude. 

Fitness to Teach 

12. 

Applying the Morrison factors, respondent’s 2019 and 2015 DUI offenses 

render her unfit to teach. There was no evidence presented of respondent’s 

misconduct adversely affecting her students, teachers, or the educational community; 

however, her repeated disregard for public safety did not set a good example for 

children. Respondent’s misconduct is not remote in time, considering her alcohol-

related criminal conduct occurred over 12 years and her most recent DUI offense 

occurred only about three and one-half years ago. There were aggravating 

circumstances surrounding respondent’s 2019 and 2015 DUI offenses: her blood-

alcohol concentration was close to three times the legal limit of 0.08 percent for both 

offenses, which were her third and fourth DUI offenses. Respondent’s conduct also 

posed a significant threat to public safety and is incompatible with a teacher’s status 

and duties. (Broney v. Calif. Comm. On Teacher Credentialing (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 

462, 477 [a teacher’s third DUI conviction rendered her unfit to teach, citing the 

Morrison factors].) There was nothing praiseworthy about respondent’s conduct. 

Although respondent is currently sober and testified credibly about her intent to 

remain sober, she has only been sober for three and one-half years. Based on 

respondent’s lengthy history of significant struggles with alcohol abuse, it is therefore 

12 

premature to assess the likelihood of relapse. Although the evidence did not disclose 

any specific publicity surrounding respondent’s misconduct, information regarding 

criminal convictions is available to the public. 

13. 

Complainant established by a preponderance of the evidence 

respondent’s 2015 and 2019 DUI offenses constitute acts of moral turpitude which 

render respondent unfit to teach. Cause therefore exists to deny respondent’s 

application pursuant to Education Code section 44345, subdivision (e). 

Disposition 

14. 

The Commission’s regulations set forth aggravating factors 

demonstrating a greater degree of adverse action for an act of professional 

misconduct is needed to adequately protect the public, schoolchildren, or the 

profession. Aggravating factors include (1) misconduct evidencing multiple acts of 

wrongdoing or demonstrating a pattern of misconduct; (2) misconduct surrounded by 

or followed by bad faith, dishonesty, or other violation of the laws governing 

educators; (3) the applicant demonstrated indifference toward the consequence of the 

misconduct, which includes failure to comply with known court orders; and (4) the 

applicant had prior notice, warnings, or reprimands for similar conduct from any 

reliable source. (CCR, § 80300, subds. (b)(2)–(b)(3), (b)(5)–(b)(6).) 

15. 

The Commission’s regulations also set forth mitigating factors 

demonstrating a lesser degree of adverse action for an act of professional misconduct 

is needed to adequately protect the public, schoolchildren, or the profession. 

Mitigating factors include (1) demonstration of good character of the applicant 

attested to by references from the educational community or the general community 

13 

from individuals aware of the extent of the applicant’s misconduct and (2) the nature 

and extent of subsequent rehabilitation. (CCR, § 80300, subds. (m)(4), (m)(7).) 

16. 

Several of the Commission’s aggravating factors apply to respondent’s 

case. Respondent has a significant history of alcohol-related criminal conduct, 

demonstrating a disregard for public safety despite repeated warnings about the 

dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol. Her 2019 DUI offense occurred while 

she was still on probation for her 2015 DUI offense. Although respondent submitted 

evidence of rehabilitation and good character, the Commission’s applicable 

aggravating factors outweigh the applicable mitigating factors in this case. 

17. 

Rehabilitation is a “state of mind,” and the law looks with favor upon 

rewarding with the opportunity to serve, one who has achieved “reformation and 

regeneration.” (Pacheco v. State Bar (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1041, 1058.) Fully acknowledging 

the wrongfulness of past actions is an essential step towards rehabilitation (Seide v. 

Committee of Bar Examiners (1989) 49 Cal.3d 933, 940). However, a truer indication of 

rehabilitation than remorse is sustained conduct over an extended period of time. (In 

re Menna (1995) 11 Cal.4th 975, 991.) “The evidentiary significance of misconduct is 

greatly diminished by the passage of time and by the absence of similar, more recent 

misconduct.” (Kwasnik v. State Bar (1990) 50 Cal.3d 1061, 1070.) Little weight is given 

to an applicant’s good behavior while on probation or parole. (In re Gossage (2000) 23 

Cal.4th 1080.) 

18. 

Considering the totality of circumstances, denial of respondent’s 

application is warranted. Although respondent demonstrated significant rehabilitation, 

more time is required for her to demonstrate her fitness to teach. Her most recent DUI 

offense was only about three and one-half years ago and on the date of the hearing in 

this case, she was still on probation for that criminal conviction. Her misconduct was 

14 

serious and occurred over many years. Respondent is commended for her 

commitment to sobriety and her changed lifestyle. Should she choose to reapply in 

the future, her continued sobriety will reflect favorably on her fitness to teach. 

ORDER 

The application of respondent Tara Gutierrez for a Certificate of Clearance is 

denied.
