BEFORE THE 
COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
In the Matter of the Accusation Against: 
TAMARA PILAR WAGNER, Respondent 
Agency Case No. 2-273992602 
OAH No. 2024010634 
PROPOSED DECISION 
Sean Gavin, Administrative Law Judge, Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), 
State of California, heard this matter on March 20, 2024, from Sacramento, California. 
Malissa N. Siemantel, Deputy Attorney General, represented complainant Mary 
Vixie Sandy, Ed.D., Executive Director of the California Commission on Teacher 
Credentialing (Commission).
Respondent Tamara Pilar Wagner (respondent) failed to appear, nor did anyone 
appear on her behalf. Respondent was properly served with the notice of hearing, and 
the matter proceeded as a default pursuant to Government Code section 11520. 
Evidence was received, the record closed, and the matter submitted for decision 
on March 20, 2024. 2 FACTUAL FINDINGS
Jurisdictional Matters 
1. Respondent holds or held multiple credentials and certificates from the 
Commission (collectively, “respondent’s credentials”). On September 4, 1991, the 
Commission issued respondent an Emergency 30-Day Substitute Teaching Credential, 
which expired on June 30, 1994. On January 11, 1994, the Commission issued 
respondent a Preliminary Multiple Subject Teaching Credential, which expired on 
February 1, 1999. On February 9, 1999, the Commission issued respondent a Clear 
Multiple Subject Teaching Credential, which is scheduled to expire on April 1, 2024, 
unless renewed or revoked. On August 25, 2003, the Commission issued respondent a 
Clear Crosscultural, Language and Academic Development Certificate (CLAD 
Certificate), which was in full force and effect at all relevant times. 
2. On October 28, 20221, the Commission’s Committee of Credentials 
(Committee) determined probable cause existed to recommend that the Commission 
suspend respondent’s credentials for 180 days based on her November 2021 
conviction for driving with a blood alcohol content (BAC) or 0.08 percent or greater 
(driving under the influence of alcohol, or DUI) and the conduct underlying the 
conviction. The evidence did not establish whether respondent timely requested an 
administrative hearing challenging that recommendation.
 
1 The Accusation stated the date as “October 20-22, 2021.” At hearing, 
complainant moved to amend the Accusation, at paragraph 9, page 3, line 2, to read 
“October 19-21, 2022.” The motion was granted and the Accusation was so amended. 3 3. On March 29, 2023, complainant, acting solely in her official capacity, 
signed an Accusation seeking to discipline respondent’s credentials based on her
unprofessional conduct, immoral conduct, and commission of an act involving moral 
turpitude based on her November 2021 DUI conviction and the underlying conduct. 
The Accusation further alleged, as a matter in aggravation, that the Commission 
suspended respondent’s credentials for 21 days in April 2010 based on her October 
2007 and June 2005 DUI convictions and the conduct underlying both. Respondent 
filed a Notice of Defense to the Accusation. This hearing followed. 
Cause for Discipline: November 2021 DUI Conviction 
4. On November 5, 2021, in the Superior Court of California, County of San 
Joaquin, case number LOD-CR-MDUI-2021-0010026, respondent was convicted, on 
her plea of no contest, of violating Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (b) (DUI), a 
misdemeanor. She also admitted a sentencing enhancement under Vehicle Code 
section 23578 (having a BAC exceeding 0.15 percent). The court suspended imposition 
of sentence and placed respondent on informal probation for three years on 
conditions that she serve seven days in jail, complete a nine-month alcohol program, 
and pay fines and fees. The circumstances underlying the conviction occurred on July 
23, 2021, when respondent drove after drinking alcohol and crashed her vehicle into 
an irrigation canal. 
Matters in Aggravation: April 2010 Suspension for October 2007 and 
June 2005 DUI Convictions 
5. On April 30, 2010, the Commission suspended respondent’s credentials 
for 21 days based on her previous DUI convictions. Specifically, on October 9, 2007, in 
the Superior Court of California, County of San Joaquin, respondent was convicted, on 4 her plea of no contest, of misdemeanor DUI. Additionally, on June 27, 2005, in the 
Superior Court of California, County of San Joaquin, respondent was convicted, on her 
plea of no contest, of misdemeanor DUI.
Morrison Factors
6. In (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, the California 
Supreme Court concluded a teaching credential cannot be disciplined for immoral 
conduct, unprofessional conduct, or conduct involving moral turpitude “unless that 
conduct indicates that the [educator] is unfit to teach.” ( . at p. 229.) The Court 
outlined factors to consider when determining whether an educator’s conduct 
demonstrates unfitness to teach ( .), and the Commission adopted those factors by 
enacting California Code of Regulations, title 5, section 80302.
LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE EFFECT ON STUDENTS OR FELLOW TEACHERS 
7. “A teacher [. . .] in the public school system is regarded by the public and 
pupils in the light of an exemplar, whose words and actions are likely to be followed 
by the children coming under [her] care and protection.” (
(1953) 41 Cal.2d 546, 552.) Respondent’s disregard for the law reflects poorly on her 
individually, and on teachers generally. Moreover, the nature of respondent’s criminal 
activity demonstrates a severe lack of sound judgment. Because students are 
impressionable and may try to emulate their teachers, it is essential that an educator’s 
behavior be beyond reproach. Respondent’s November 2021 conviction and the 
underlying conduct demonstrated behavior inimical to the well-being of students, and 
portrayed both her and the teaching profession negatively. 5 TYPE OF CREDENTIALS HELD
8. Respondent’s Clear Multiple Subject Teaching Credential and CLAD 
Certificate authorize her to teach students of many ages in a variety of contexts. 
Therefore, it is even more imperative that she exemplify the type of behavior society 
wants emulated by students and possess sound judgment. Respondent’s November 
2021 conviction and the underlying conduct raise concerns over whether she is an 
appropriate role model for her students.
EXTENUATING OR AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES
9. Neither the Education Code nor the regulations adopted by the 
Commission specify what constitutes “extenuating circumstances.” However, the 
California Code of Regulations defines “mitigating factor” as “an event or circumstance 
which demonstrates that the public, schoolchildren and the profession would be 
adequately protected by a more lenient degree of adverse action or no adverse action 
whatsoever.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 5, § 80300, subd. (m).) The Commission’s regulations 
also define “aggravating factor” as “an event or circumstance which demonstrates that 
a greater degree of adverse action for an act of professional misconduct is needed to 
adequately protect the public, schoolchildren or the profession.” ( . at § 80300, subd. 
(b).) 
10. The repeated nature of respondent’s criminal conduct demonstrates a 
pattern of misconduct involving the irresponsible use of alcohol. Furthermore, 
respondent’s convictions demonstrate a flagrant disrespect for the law. Taken 
together, respondent’s convictions and the underlying conduct demonstrate the need 
for a greater degree of adverse action to ensure public protection. Respondent did not 
offer any evidence of mitigating circumstances. 6 PRAISEWORTHINESS OR BLAMEWORTHINESS OF THE MOTIVES RESULTING IN 
THE MISCONDUCT
11. Respondent bears the sole blame for her criminal conduct. Her choices
led her to drive after using alcohol and the resulting DUI conviction.
LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE  
12. Respondent has already been convicted of DUI three times. She did not 
attend the hearing or offer any evidence to suggest her criminal behavior is unlikely to 
reoccur. 
Analysis 
13. It is undisputed respondent was convicted of DUI in November 2021, 
following two previous DUI convictions in October 2007 and June 2005. The evidence 
established the criminal conduct underlying her convictions involved driving while 
under the influence of alcohol. The clear and convincing evidence established that 
respondent engaged in unprofessional and immoral conduct and committed an act 
involving moral turpitude. When considering the relevant factors, 
respondent’s conduct demonstrated her unfitness to teach for the reasons explained 
above. Therefore, cause exists to discipline her credentials. In light of the serious and 
repeated nature of her criminal conduct, coupled with the Committee’s 
recommendation, respondent’s credentials should be suspended for 180 days. 7 LEGAL CONCLUSIONS
1. Complainant bears the burden of proving the existence of grounds for 
disciplining respondent’s credentials, and must do so by clear and convincing evidence 
to a reasonable certainty. ( (1983) 33 Cal.3d 532, 536 
[“When an administrative agency initiates an action to suspend or revoke a license, the 
burden of proving the facts necessary to support the action rests with the agency 
making the allegation”]; (1985) 164 
Cal.App.3d 1036, 1039-1040 [recognizing that the clear and convincing evidence 
standard applies to proceedings to discipline a teacher’s credential, whereas the lesser 
preponderance of the evidence standard applies to proceedings to dismiss a teacher 
from particular employment].) “The courts have defined clear and convincing evidence 
as evidence which is so clear as to leave no substantial doubt and as sufficiently strong 
to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind. [Citations.] It has been 
said that a preponderance calls for probability, while clear and convincing proof 
demands a [citations].” (  (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 890, 899; 
italics original.) 
2. The California Supreme Court has recognized that the terms “immoral 
conduct” and “unprofessional conduct” substantially overlap one another and that 
conduct which constitutes one, often includes the other. (See, 
, , 1 Cal.3d at p. 221, fn. 9.) “Unprofessional conduct” includes “‘that 
which violates the rules of ethical code of a profession or such conduct which is 
unbecoming a member of a profession in good standing.’” (
, 41 Cal.2d at p. 553; quoting, 66 Corpus Juris, p. 55.) In describing what 
constitutes “immoral conduct” within the context of the Education Code, the court in 8 (1960) 179 
Cal.App.2d 808, said: 
In , 36 Cal.2d 734, at page 
740 [227 P.2d 449], the Supreme Court quotes with 
approval the following statement from Words and Phrases, 
permanent edition, volume 20, pages 159-160: “The term 
‘immoral’ has been defined generally as that which is hostile 
to the welfare of the general public and contrary to good 
morals. Immorality has not been confined to sexual matters, 
but includes conduct inconsistent with rectitude, or 
indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, dissoluteness; 
or as willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct showing moral 
indifference to the opinions of respectable members of the 
community, and as an inconsiderate attitude toward good 
order and the public welfare.”
(., at p. 811.)
3. The court in 
 (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1454, said the following about the 
definition of immoral or unprofessional conduct: 
Moreover, the definition of immoral or unprofessional 
conduct must be considered in conjunction with the unique 
position of public school teachers, upon whom are imposed 
“responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which 
do not exist in regard to other callings.” [Citation.] 9 (., at p. 1466.)
4. And the following has been said about the analysis for determining 
whether particular conduct constitutes sufficient cause for taking adverse action 
against a credential: 
, 66 Cal.App. 157, 168 [225 
P. 783], quoted in , 41 Cal.2d 
546, 553-554 [261 P.2d 261], found that the standards for 
judging the propriety of a teacher’s conduct, and the extent 
to which that conduct may be the basis for the revocation 
of a credential, involves many aspects. “. . . the teacher is 
entrusted with the custody of children and their high 
preparation for useful life. His habits, his speech, his good 
name, his cleanliness, the wisdom and propriety of his 
unofficial utterances, his associations, all are involved. His 
ability to inspire children and to govern them, his power as 
a teacher, and the character for which he stands are matters 
of major concern in a teacher’s selection and retention.”
(  (1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 988, 991.) 
5. The Commission may discipline a credential for unprofessional conduct. 
(Ed. Code, § 44421.) The clear and convincing evidence established respondent 
engaged in unprofessional conduct. Therefore, cause exists to discipline her credential
pursuant to Education Code section 44421.
6. The Commission may discipline a credential for immoral conduct. (Ed. 
Code, § 44421.) The clear and convincing evidence established respondent engaged in 10 immoral conduct. Therefore, cause exists to discipline her credential pursuant to 
Education Code section 44421. 
7. The Commission may discipline a credential “for any cause that would 
have warranted the denial of an application for a credential or the renewal thereof.” 
(Ed. Code, § 44421.) An application for a credential may be denied if the applicant “has 
committed any act involving moral turpitude.” (Ed. Code, § 44345, subd. (e).) The clear 
and convincing evidence established respondent committed an act involving moral 
turpitude. Therefore, cause exists to discipline her credential pursuant to Education 
Code section 44421, as that statute relates to Education Code section 44345, 
subdivision (e). 
8. Cause exists to discipline respondent’s credentials for the reasons 
explained above. However, respondent’s actions were not so extreme or harmful as to 
indicate revocation of her credentials is the only manner of protecting the public. 
Rather, consistent with the Committee’s recommendation, respondent’s credentials 
should be suspended for 180 days. 
ORDER 
All credentials, certificates, and authorizations issued to respondent Tamara 
Pilar Wagner are suspended for the period of 180 days from the effective date of this 
Decision.
