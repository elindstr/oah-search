Failure to Comply with Terms of Probation 

11. 

Berenice Osequera testified at the hearing on behalf of complainant. Ms. 

Osequera has been employed by the Commission as a special investigator for six years 

and has served as respondent’s probation monitor since March 2022. 

12.  On March 4, 2022, Ms. Osequera mailed respondent an orientation 

packet, which instructed her to contact Ms. Osequera by March 18, 2022, to schedule a 

probation orientation. The orientation packet was sent by certified mail via United 

States Postal Service. Respondent did not contact Ms. Osequera by March 18, 2022. 

On March 21, 2022, respondent left a voicemail message for Ms. Osequera, indicating 

she had opened the orientation packet. On April 6, 2022, respondent completed her 

probation orientation meeting, during which she was instructed to identify and select 

a testing facility that met all the Commission’s requirements to comply with Probation 

Condition 11. Additionally, respondent was informed that she could not consume 

alcohol during the five-year term of probation. 

13.  On April 9, 2022, respondent informed Ms. Osequera that she had 

attended support group meetings “every Sunday since February 27.” Ms. Osequera 

requested respondent provide evidence of her attendance. As of the date of hearing, 

respondent has not provided any evidence of her attendance in support group 

meetings as required by Probation Condition 9. 

14. 

Between April 19, 2022, and May 26, 2023, Ms. Osequera repeatedly 

instructed respondent to identify and select a testing facility. As of the date of the 

hearing, respondent has not identified and selected a testing facility. 

15.  On June 14, September 16, and November 8, 2022, and January 12 and 

May 22, 2023, respondent was instructed to submit to bodily fluid testing for the 

4 

presence of alcohol, cannabis, or controlled substances as required by Probation 

Condition 11. As of the date of hearing, respondent has not submitted to any bodily 

fluid testing. 

16.  On May 10, 2022, respondent was instructed to execute and submit to 

Ms. Osequera a Release of Information form that the Commission requires to monitor 

her probation compliance. As of the date of hearing, respondent has not submitted 

any Release of Information forms as required by Probation Condition 12. 

17.  On June 1, 2022, respondent’s first quarterly compliance report was due 

to the Commission. As of the date of hearing, respondent has not submitted any 

quarterly compliance reports as required by Probation Condition 4. 

18.  On April 26 and July 1, 2022, and June 5, 2023, Ms. Osequera sent notice 

to respondent informing her that she was in violation of probation. 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

Commission’s Authority 

1. 

The Commission is responsible for the credentialing of public school 

teachers, including issuing credentials and taking adverse action against applicants 

and credential holders, pursuant to Education Code (Code) section 44000 et seq. and 

California Code of Regulations, title 5, section 80001 et seq. 

Burden and Standard of Proof 

2. 

Because this case involves a professional license, the burden of proof is 

on complainant to establish cause for adverse action by clear and convincing evidence 

5 

to a reasonable certainty. (Ettinger v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance (1982) 135 

Cal.App.3d 853, 855-856.) This means the burden rests with complainant to offer proof 

that is clear, explicit, and unequivocal, “so clear as to leave no substantial doubt” and 

“sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.” (In 

re Marriage of Weaver (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 478, 487; citations omitted.) In this case, 

complainant met her burden of establishing cause for revoking respondent’s license 

probation, lifting the stay of the revocation, and revoking her credentials. 

Bases to Revoke Probation 

3. 

Cause exists to revoke probation because complainant established by 

clear and convincing evidence that respondent failed to comply with Probation 

Condition 2 in that she failed to comply with all probation terms as required. (Factual 

Findings 4-17.) 

4. 

Cause exists to revoke probation because complainant established by 

clear and convincing evidence that respondent failed to comply with Probation 

Condition 4 in that she failed to submit written reports as required. (Factual Findings 4, 

6 and 17.) 

5. 

Cause exists to revoke probation because complainant established by 

clear and convincing evidence that respondent failed to comply with Probation 

Condition 9 in that she failed to attend support group meetings and to provide 

evidence of attendance, as required. (Factual Findings 4, 7 and 13.) 

6. 

Cause exists to revoke probation because complainant established by 

clear and convincing evidence that respondent failed to comply with Probation 

Condition 11 in that she failed to submit tests and samples, as required. (Factual 

Findings 4, 8, 14 and 15.) 

6 

7. 

Cause exists to revoke probation because complainant established by 

clear and convincing evidence that respondent failed to comply with Probation 

Condition 12 in that she failed to attend execute release forms, as required. (Factual 

Findings 4, 9 and 16.) 

ORDER 

1. 

The First Amended Petition to Revoke Probation is granted. 

2. 

The probation that was granted by the California Commission on Teacher 

Credentialing in Case No. 2-82661140 is revoked, and the stay on the disciplinary 

order that was imposed is lifted, thereby revoking Single Subject Teaching Credential, 

30-Day Substitute Teaching Permit, and Preliminary Single Subject Teaching 

Credential, issued to respondent Diane Marie Colegate.
