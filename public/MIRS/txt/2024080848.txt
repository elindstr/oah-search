OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
In the Matter of the Motion for Immediate Reversal of 
Suspension of: 
RUSSELL SHUGARS, a Permanent Certificated Employee, 
Moving Party, 
v. 
CARMEL UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, Responding Party. 
OAH No. 2024080848 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 
SUSPENSION 
Irina Tentser, Administrative Law Judge, Office of Administrative Hearings 
(OAH), State of California, heard oral argument on this matter by videoconference on 
September 13, 2024. 
Joseph Cisneros, Attorney, The Biegel Law Firm, represented moving party 
Russell Shugars (Shugars).
Ingrid A. Meyers, Attorney, Dannis Woliver Kelley, LLP, represented Carmel 
Unified School District (District). 2 Procedural History
On August 15, 2024, the District served Shugars with a Statement of Charges, 
immediately suspending him without pay and providing him with notice of its intent to 
dismiss him as a permanent certificated teacher. (Ed. Code, § 44932.) (All further 
statutory references are to the Education Code, unless otherwise noted.) Shugars 
timely filed a Demand for Hearing and Notice of Defense. The hearing has not yet 
been scheduled. 
On August 23, 2024, Shugars filed a Notice of Motion and Motion for 
Immediate Reversal of Suspension (Motion) to challenge his immediate suspension 
without pay. (§ 44939, subd. (c).) Shugars contends the Statement of Charges does not 
set forth a sufficient basis for immediate unpaid suspension. Specifically, Shugars 
asserts the allegations do not rise to the level of “immoral conduct” and therefore do 
not justify an immediate unpaid suspension. (§ 44939, subd. (b).) 
On September 3, 2024, the District filed an Opposition to the Motion. 
On September 6, 2024, Shugars filed a Reply in support of the Motion. 
The hearing on the Motion, including oral argument, occurred on September 
13, 2023. The parties submitted on the filed papers. 
Based on the reasoning set forth below, the Motion is granted because the facts 
alleged in the Statement of Charges are insufficient to support a charge of immoral 
conduct. Shugars’s immediate unpaid suspension shall, therefore, be lifted. 3 Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension
Section 44939, subdivision (b), allows a school district to immediately suspend a 
permanent employee without pay who has been charged with, among other things, 
immoral conduct. An employee who has been placed on such suspension may, 
however, file a motion for immediate reversal of suspension (MIRS). (§ 44939, subd. 
(c)(1).) In reviewing a MIRS, the review “shall be limited to a determination as to 
whether the facts as alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to 
constitute a basis for immediate suspension under this section.” ( .) 
STATEMENT OF CHARGES
Shugars has taught at the District for 16 years, since 2008. Shugars was most 
recently assigned as a Physical Education (PE) teacher at Carmel River Elementary 
School. Shugars has also coached wrestling for various programs in the District and 
has been both the assistant and head coach of wrestling at Carmel High School. 
The District alleges multiple instances of conduct by Shugars between March 
and May 2024, including the following instances in March 2024:
March 1, 2024: While students were playing jump 
rope in the multipurpose room for PE, [Shugars] told 
a 5th grade student (“Student A”) to stop trying to 
do a stunt because “this has just gone too far!” and 
“you wouldn’t do this outside so just stop.” [Shugars] 
also called Student A a “clown” and clarified his 
statement by saying Student A likes to be [ ] center 
of attention and it’s the “Student A Show.” Student A 
felt [Shugars] taunted him.4 March 20, 2024: During PE around 10:30 a.m., while it 
may not have been intentional, it was more likely 
than not that [Shugars] threw a [traffic] cone at a 
male student in his class hitting the student in the 
face. 
March 21, 2024: While students in [Shugars’s] class 
were playing frisbee during PE, [Shugars] told 
Student A that his throw was “garbage” and had 
Student A sit out the rest of the time while the other 
students continued playing frisbee.
 March 21, 2024: During “Run Across America” at 
approximately 2:50 p.m., it’s more likely than not that 
[Shugars] made intentional body contact with a 5th 
grade male student (“Student B”) not in his PE class 
at the time. More specifically, while Student B was 
walking backwards on the track, [Shugars] entered 
the track and made physical contact with Student B 
running him around forcefully so Student B would 
walk forwards. There was no reason for [Shugars’s] 
involvement with another teacher’s student.
(Statement of Charges, ¶ 13.) 
The District also alleges that on May 2, 2024 Shugars “barged into Carmel River 
Principal Alberto Ramirez’s office looking visibly angry and his face was red. [Shugars] 
said to Mr. Ramirez, “I have two kids for you. Do you want to speak to them now. . .. 5 Later on, May 2, 2024, [Shugars] returned to the school office asking for the students’ 
teachers’ names quite loudly and in an unprofessional manner when parents were 
present.” (Statement of Charges, ¶ 17.) 
In addition, the District alleges Shugars “kept giving negative stares to [a 
parent’s] child during PE class making his child fearful of [Shugars] . . . [and] while 
picking up his child from school, on May 3, 2024, he and his child ran into [Shugars] in 
front of his officer wherein [Shugars] gave the parent a very negative look and his 
body language showed an aggressive stature. According to the parent’s child this was 
the same “mean look” [Shugars] gave [the child] during PE class.” (Statement of 
Charges, ¶ 18.) 
Finally, the District alleges the following multiple instances of additional 
conduct in May 2024: 
 On May 3, 2024, during PE class [Shugars] was 
noticeably angry and agitated because students were 
not paying attention to the PE Assistant or Dance 
Instructor when preparing for the May Festival. He 
was also observed becoming increasingly agitated, 
walking around students, “staring them down,” and 
using a loud forceful voice to scold the students to 
be quiet and pay attention. [Shugars] looked like he 
was going to burst.
 On two occasions, on May 3, 2024, [Shugars] stepped 
away from his class to regain his composure. First, he 
stepped away and punched his fist into his other 6 hand in front of another employee and students. 
Second, he stepped away and dropped to the 
ground to do push-ups. [Shugars’s] actions shocked 
the employee and students who observed his 
actions.
 Respondent was observed on May 3, 2024, walking 
around scolding students in his PE Class and coming 
within three feet of the male student whose father 
filed the May 3, 2024, complaint [against Shugars]. 
(Statement of Charges, ¶ 20.) 
IMMORAL CONDUCT  
“[T]he term ‘immoral conduct’ in section 44932, subdivision (a)(1), ‘stretch[es] 
over so wide a range’ of conduct that it ‘embrace[s] an unlimited area of conduct.’” 
( (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 327, 337, 
quoting (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 224-225.)
The term “immoral” has been defined generally as that 
which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and 
contrary to good morals. Immorality has not been confined 
to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with 
rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, 
dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct 
showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 
members of the community, and as an inconsiderate 
attitude toward good order and the public welfare. 7 ( (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811, quoting 
 (1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 740 and 
(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 967, 972.)
Moreover, the definition of immoral or unprofessional 
conduct must be considered in conjunction with the unique 
position of public school teachers, upon whom are imposed 
“responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which 
do not exist in regards to other callings.” 
( (2011) 194 
Cal.App.4th 1454, 1466, quoting  (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 
820, 824.) “Thus, the term must be ‘considered in the context in which the Legislature 
considered it, as conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the general public . . . more 
specifically in this case, conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the school 
community.’” ( , , 53 Cal.App.5th at p. 337, quoting , supra, 1
Cal.3d at p. 224.)
ANALYSIS –IMMORAL CONDUCT
Generally, the appellate court has held that immoral conduct falls into the 
categories of sexual harassment or public sexual activity, a teacher’s drug use or 
possession, theft of property or compensation by the teacher, and a teacher making 
racist comments about students on social media. (See supra; 
(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 967; Board of Trustees v. Stubblefield (1971) 
16 Cal.App.3d 820; (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 369; 
(2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 339.)8 In this matter, however, none of the allegations by the District against Shugars 
are based on the types of conduct which constitutes immoral conduct as described in 
relevant case law.
Accordingly, accepting all material facts properly pleaded as true, the Statement 
of Charges does not allege facts sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate 
suspension for immoral conduct under section 44939, subdivision (b). The Motion is 
therefore granted. 
ORDER
The Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension is granted. This order shall 
become effective within five days of service and the District shall make Shugars whole 
for any lost wages and compensation within 14 days after service of the order.
