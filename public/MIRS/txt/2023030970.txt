BEFORE THE 
OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 

In the Matter of the Motion for Immediate Reversal of 

Suspension of: 

DANIEL ALVAREZ, A Permanent Certificated Employee, 

Respondent and Moving Party 

OAH No. 2023030970 

ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 

SUSPENSION 

Sean Gavin, Administrative Law Judge, Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), 

State of California, heard this matter telephonically on April 14, 2023, from 

Sacramento, California. 

Matthew Chevedden, Attorney at Law, represented Daniel Alvarez (respondent). 

Davis Adams and Gabriela Flowers, Attorneys at Law, represented the 

Sacramento City Unified School District (the District). 

The matter was argued and submitted for decision on April 14, 2023. 

Procedural History 

On February 16, 2023, the District’s Chief Human Resources Officer signed and 

subsequently sent to respondent a Notice of Intent to Dismiss; Placement on 

Immediate Unpaid Suspension Pending Outcome of Disciplinary Proceedings; and 

Statement of Charges. The Statement of Charges alleged grounds to terminate 

respondent. The Statement of Charges also alleged grounds to immediately suspend 

respondent without pay for immoral conduct under Education Code1 section 44939. 

On March 29, 2023, respondent filed a Motion for Immediate Reversal of 

Suspension (Motion) pursuant to section 44939, subdivision (c), in which he alleged 

the allegations and charges contained in the Statement of Charges are insufficient to 

authorize the District to suspend him without pay pending his hearing before the 

Commission on Professional Competence. The District filed a written opposition to 

respondent’s Motion, and respondent filed a written reply to the opposition. 

Summary of Facts Alleged in the Statement of Charges2 

Respondent is a high school teacher for the District. The Statement of Charges 

alleged respondent made sexualized comments in class; made inappropriate 

comments to students regarding the female menstrual cycle; talked about ejaculation 

1 Statutory references are to the Education Code, unless otherwise specified. 

2 Section 44939, subdivision (c), requires the facts in the Statement of Charges 

to be treated as true for purposes of this Motion. Consequently, the statements below 

are not findings of fact, but rather summaries of the allegations as they appear in the 

Statement of Charges.

and masturbation; talked about rubbing a penis; inappropriately discussed sexual 

intercourse; called students “assholes” and “bitches”; berated and ridiculed students; 

inappropriately touched students’ hands and faces; tripped students; and threw water 

on students. 

Analysis 

The District may immediately suspend a permanent employee who has been 

charged with immoral conduct. (§ 44939, subd. (b).) The suspended employee may 

then move for immediate reversal of the suspension. (Id. at subd. (c)(1).) “Review of a 

motion filed pursuant to this section shall be limited to a determination as to whether 

the facts as alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a 

basis for immediate suspension under this section.” (Ibid.) 

“[T]he term ‘immoral conduct’ in section 44932, subdivision (a)(1) ‘stretch[es] 

over so wide a range’ of conduct that it ‘embrace[s] an unlimited area of conduct.’” 

(Crawford v. Comm’n on Professional Competence (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 327, 337, 

quoting Morrison v. State Bd. of Ed. (1960) 1 Cal.3d 214, 224-225.) 

The term “immoral” has been defined generally as that 

which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and 

contrary to good morals. Immorality has not been confined 

to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with 

rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity; 

dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct 

showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 

members of the community, and as an inconsiderate 

attitude toward good order and the public welfare.

(Bd. of Ed. v. Weiland (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811, quoting Orloff v. Los Angeles 

Turf Club (1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 740.) 

Moreover, the definition of immoral or unprofessional 

conduct must be considered in conjunction with the unique 

position of public school teachers; upon whom are imposed 

“responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which 

do not exist in regard to other callings.” 

(San Diego Unified School Dist. v. Comm’n on Professional Competence (2011) 194 

Cal.App.4th 1454, 1466, quoting Bd. of Trustees v. Stubblefield (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 

820, 824.) 

The ALJ has considered the parties’ written submissions and oral argument. 

Based on a review of the Statement of Charges, the District has alleged facts which, if 

true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate suspension under section 44939, 

subdivision (b). Accordingly, the Motion must be denied. 

ORDER 

Respondent’s Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension is DENIED.
