BEFORE THE 
OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 

In the Matter of the Motion for Immediate Reversal of 

Suspension of: 

SEAN REDMOND, A Permanent Certificated Employee, 

Moving Party, 

v. 

GARDEN GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, 

Responding Party. 

OAH No. 2023090492 

(Related to OAH No. 2023090709) 

ORDER DENYING MOTION 

FOR IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF SUSPENSION 

(Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (c)(4)) 

Administrative Law Judge Juliet E. Cox, State of California, Office of 

Administrative Hearings, heard this matter on October 13, 2023, by videoconference. 

Attorney Arthur N. Four represented respondent and moving party Sean 

Redmond. 

Attorney Jacquelyn Takeda Morenz represented the Garden Grove Unified 

School District. 

PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

On August 16, 2023, a representative of the Garden Grove Unified School 

District (District) signed a statement of charges alleging cause to dismiss Sean 

Redmond from employment with the District as a teacher. The charges include 

immoral conduct. In reliance on these charges, the District has suspended respondent 

from employment without pay. 

On September 13, 2023, respondent timely filed a motion seeking immediate 

reversal of his suspension and reinstating his salary and benefits pending resolution of 

the charges against him. Respondent argues that the District has not alleged an 

adequate basis to suspend him from employment without pay before resolution of 

these charges, because the allegations do not describe immoral conduct. The District 

opposes respondent’s motion. 

APPLICABLE STATUTES 

Education Code section 44939 permits the District to suspend immediately, 

without pay, a permanent employee who the District alleges to have committed 

“immoral conduct.” (Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (b).) Administrative review of an order for 

immediate suspension is available, “limited to a determination as to whether the facts 

alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for 

immediate suspension under this section.” (Id., subd. (c)(1).)

DISCUSSION 

The statement of charges has been considered in light of the parties’ written 

and oral arguments. The District has alleged facts that, if true, would establish immoral 

conduct. The District’s allegations justify respondent’s immediate suspension under 

Education Code section 44939, subdivision (b). 

ORDER 

The motion by respondent and moving party Sean Redmond for immediate 

reversal of suspension and for reimbursement of pay and benefits during the period of 

suspension is denied.
