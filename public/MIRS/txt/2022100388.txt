Moving Party 

and 

CARPINTERIA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, 

Responding Party 

OAH Case No. 2022100388 

ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 

SUSPENSION 

Matthew S. Block, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), Office of Administrative 

Hearings (OAH), State of California, heard this matter telephonically from Sacramento, 

California, on November 4, 2022.

Estephanie Villalpando, Attorney at Law, represented John Hotchner (Hotchner).

Vanessa Lee, Attorney at Law, Fagen, Friedman & Fulfrost, LLP, represented 

Carpinteria Unified School District (District).

Procedural History 

On September 14, 2022, the District served Hotchner with a Notice of Intent to 

Immediately Suspend Without Pay and Dismiss (Notice). The Notice was based on a 

Statement of Charges, dated September 13, 2022, and alleged cause to dismiss based 

on immoral conduct (Ed. Code, § 44932, subd. (a)(1)1; unprofessional conduct (

., 

subd. (a)(2); dishonesty (

., subd. (a)(4); evident unfitness for service (

., subd. (a)(6); 

and persistent violation of or refusal to obey the school laws of the state or reasonable 

regulations prescribed for the government of the public schools by the state board or 

by the governing board of the school district employing him (

., subd. (a)(8)). The 

Notice alleged cause to immediately suspend Hotchner without pay for immoral 

conduct. (§ 44939, subd. (b).) Hotchner timely filed a Request for Hearing. 

On October 14, 2022, Hotchner also filed a Notice of Motion and Motion for 

Immediate Reversal of Suspension (Motion) pursuant to section 44939, subdivision (c). 

He contends that the Statement of Charges does not adequately allege immoral 

conduct sufficient to support an immediate unpaid suspension. On October 25, 2022, 

the District filed its opposition to the Motion. On November 1, 2022, Hotchner filed a 

reply brief. Oral arguments on the Motion were heard on November 4, 2022.

Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension 

Section 44939 states, in relevant part, that a school district may immediately 

suspend without pay a permanent employee of the school district who has been 

charged “with immoral conduct, conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral 

turpitude, with incompetency due to mental disability, with willful refusal to perform 

regular assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed by reasonable rules and 

regulations of the employing school district, or with violation of section 51530. . . .” (§ 

44939, subd. (b).) 

An employee who has been placed on such suspension may file a motion for 

immediate reversal of suspension. (§ 44339, subd. (c)(1).) “Review of a motion filed 

pursuant to this section shall be limited to a determination as to whether the facts as 

alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for 

immediate suspension under this section. (

.) 

STATEMENT OF CHARGES

The District alleges multiple instances of misconduct by Hotchner, occurring 

from 2018 to 2022. The allegations can be divided into two broad categories: 

engaging in inappropriate and sexually suggestive conversations with students; and 

creating a hostile classroom environment.

Examples of the first include Hotchner: (1) telling students he loves them; (2) 

suggesting that he and a female student could have a sleepover party and wear “footie 

pajamas”; (3) telling a student he wanted to give them a hug and hold their hand; (4) 

telling a female student to put on her fuzzy sweater because he wanted to pet her; (5) 

asking students if they felt a “love connection” with him; (6) asking a student for an 

invitation to her birthday party and offering to buy her a gift; and (7) making sexual 

3

comments to students, and then stating, “I am kidding, unless you don’t want me to 

be kidding.” 

Examples of the second include Hotchner: (1) ridiculing students’ clothing and 

appearance; (2) regularly making comments in front of the class that a particular 

student was “stupid”; (3) taking photos and videos of students despite their objections, 

purportedly to document dress-code violations; (4) kicking students’ feet and desks; 

and (5) subjecting students to gratuitous and inequitable punishment. 

The District contends that immediate suspension without pay is warranted 

because Hotcher’s behavior constitutes immoral conduct. 

IMMORAL CONDUCT 

“[T]he term ‘immoral conduct’ in section 44932, subdivision (a)(1) ‘stretch[es] 

over so wide a range’ of conduct that it ‘embrace[s] an unlimited area of conduct.’” 

(

quoting 

 (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 327, 337, 

 (1960) 1 Cal.3d 214, 224-225.) 

The term “immoral” has been defined generally as that 

which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and 

contrary to good morals. Immorality has not been confined 

to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with 

rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity; 

dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct 

showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 

members of the community, and as an inconsiderate 

attitude toward good order and the public welfare.

 (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811, quoting 

(1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 740 & 

 (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 967, 972.) 

Moreover, the definition of immoral or unprofessional 

conduct must be considered in conjunction with the unique 

position of public school teachers; upon whom are imposed 

“responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which 

do not exist in regard to other callings.”

(

(

 (2011) 194 

Cal.App.4th 1454, 1466, quoting 

 (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 

820, 824.) “Thus, the term must be ‘considered in the context in which the Legislature 

considered it, as conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the general public . . . more 

specifically in this case, conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the school 

community.’” (

, 

, 53 Cal.App.5th at p. 337, quoting 

, 

, 1 

Cal.3d at p. 224.) 

The parties’ written submissions and oral arguments have been considered. The 

District alleged sufficient facts in the Statement of Charges that, if true, would 

constitute immoral conduct and support immediate suspension under section 44939, 

subdivision (b). Accordingly, the Motion must be denied.
