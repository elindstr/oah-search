v. 

In the Matter of the Motion for Immediate 
Reversal of Suspension Filed by: 

ANTHONY SILVESTRI, 
A Permanent Certificated Employee, 

Moving Party, 

SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL 
DISTRICT, 

Responding Party. 

OAH No. 2019021041 
(Related Case No. 2019030290) 

ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR 
IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 
SUSPENSION 
(Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (c)(4)) 

Administrative Law Judge Jill Schlichtmann, State of California, Office of 

Administrative Hearings, heard this matter telephonically on March 22, 2019, from Oakland, 
California. 
 

Sarah Sandford-Smith and Stephen R. Jaffe, Attorneys at Law, represented respondent 

and moving party Anthony Joseph Sylvestri. 
 

Senior Deputy General Counsel Christine Lee represented the San Francisco Unified 

School District (District). 

Procedural History 
 

On January 28, 2019, a District representative served a statement of charges alleging 

cause to dismiss Anthony Sylvestri from employment with the District as a physical 
education teacher.  The charges include immoral conduct.  In reliance on this charge, the 
District has suspended respondent from employment without pay. 
 

On February 26, 2019, Sylvestri timely filed a motion seeking immediate reversal of 

his suspension and reinstating his salary and benefits pending resolution of the charges 
against him.   
 

Respondent argues that the District has not alleged an adequate basis to suspend him 
from employment without pay before resolution of these charges, because the allegations do 
not describe immoral conduct.  Respondent also argues that the motion should be granted 
because the District did not make a documented finding that suspension without pay was 
necessary.  The District opposes respondent’s motion. 
 
Statutory Authority 
 

Education Code section 44939 permits the District to suspend immediately, without 
pay, a permanent employee who the District alleges to have committed “immoral conduct.” 
(Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (b).)  The District may only take such action “if it deems that action 
necessary.”  (Ibid.)  Administrative review of an order for immediate suspension is available, 
but such review “shall be limited to a determination as to whether the facts alleged in the 
statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate suspension 
under this section.”  (Id., subd. (c)(1).) 
 
Conclusions 
 

Education Code section 44939, subdivision (b), does not require the District to make a 
written finding that it deemed the action necessary.  The Board’s unanimous January 22, 2019 
Resolution adopting and approving a Resolution of Intent to Dismiss Sylvestri directs the 
superintendent to immediately suspend Sylvestri without pay pending the hearing and 
disposition of the charges.  The resolution demonstrates the District’s determination that 
suspension without pay was warranted and necessary.   

 
The statement of charges has been considered in light of the parties’ written and oral 
arguments.  The District has alleged facts which, if true, would establish immoral conduct. 
These allegations are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate suspension under 
Education Code section 44939, subdivision (b). 
 
 

ORDER 

 

The motion by respondent and moving party Anthony Sylvestri for immediate 
reversal of suspension and for reimbursement of pay and benefits during the period of 
suspension is denied.
