Moving Party 
and 
TEMECULA VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, 
Responding Party 
OAH Case No. 2024080650 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 
SUSPENSION 
Matthew S. Block, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), Office of Administrative 
Hearings (OAH), State of California, heard this matter by videoconference and 
teleconference from Sacramento, California, on September 6, 2024. 
Fern M. Steiner, Attorney at Law, represented Bryan Noon (Noon), who 
appeared telephonically. 2 Laurie Kamerrer, Attorney at Adams, Silva & McNally, LLP, represented 
Temecula Valley Unified School District (District). 
Procedural History 
At all relevant times, Noon served as a permanent certificated employee 
assigned as a high school mathematics teacher at Temecula Valley High School. On 
May 23, 2024, the District served Noon with a Notice of Intent to Immediately Suspend 
Without Pay and Dismiss (Notice). The Notice was based on a Statement of Charges, 
dated May 23, 2024, and alleged cause to dismiss based on immoral conduct (Ed. 
Code, § 44932, subd. (a)(1)) 0F1; dishonesty ( ., subd. (a)(4)); evident unfitness for service 
(., subd. (a)(6)); and persistent violation of or refusal to obey the school laws of the 
state or reasonable regulations prescribed for the government of the public schools by 
the state board or by the governing board of the school district employing him ( ., 
subd. (a)(8)). The Notice also alleged cause to immediately suspend Noon without pay 
based on immoral conduct. (§ 44939, subd. (b).) Noon timely filed a Request for 
Hearing. 
On August 19, 2024, Noon also filed a Notice of Motion and Motion for 
Immediate Reversal of Suspension (Motion) pursuant to section 44939, subdivision (c). 
He contends that the Statement of Charges does not adequately allege immoral 
conduct sufficient to support an immediate unpaid suspension. On August 27, 2024, 
the District filed its opposition to the Motion. On August 29, 2024, Noon filed a reply 
brief. Oral arguments on the Motion were heard on September 6, 2024. 
 
1 All further statutory references are to the Education Code, unless otherwise 
specified.3 Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension
Section 44939 states, in relevant part, that a school district may immediately 
suspend without pay a permanent employee of the school district who has been 
charged “with immoral conduct, conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral 
turpitude, with incompetency due to mental disability, with willful refusal to perform 
regular assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed by reasonable rules and 
regulations of the employing school district, or with violation of section 51530. . . .” (§ 
44939, subd. (b).) 
An employee who has been placed on such suspension may file a motion for 
immediate reversal of suspension. (§ 44339, subd. (c)(1).) “Review of a motion filed 
pursuant to this section shall be limited to a determination as to whether the facts as 
alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for 
immediate suspension under this section.” ( .) 
STATEMENT OF CHARGES
The District alleges that Noon engaged in immoral conduct on multiple 
occasions between 2021 and 2024. During the 2021-2022 school year, the District 
alleges Noon constantly used YouTube to stream music in the classroom, much of 
which featured explicit sexual lyrics. Next, the District alleges that he publicly displayed 
a private email sent by a student’s parent for other students to see. Finally, the District 
alleges Noon made multiple disparaging comments to students, including “you don’t 
know what you’re doing,” “this kid isn’t smart enough to copy,” “you fucks are so 
offended by me saying fat or skinny,” and referring to students as “dumb.” 
During the 2023-2024 school year, the District alleges Noon engaged in 
inappropriate conversation with two students. Specifically, he was overheard asking 4 the students “are you gay?”; “are you a fag?”; and “do you like giving head?” Moreover, 
Noon spoke with the same two students about their personal lives and the people 
they were dating, and while referring to their academic history, commented “look what 
happens when you discover boys.”
The District also alleges Noon shared inappropriate personal information with 
students during the 2023-2024 school year. Specifically, it is alleged that Noon told 
students he stole cigarettes when he was seven years old and stole a car as a young 
man. Finally, the District alleges Noon discussed the negative academic performance 
and behavior of students in front of other students. 
The District contends that immediate suspension without pay is warranted 
because Noon’s behavior constitutes immoral conduct. 
IMMORAL CONDUCT 
“[T]he term ‘immoral conduct’ in section 44932, subdivision (a)(1) ‘stretch[es] 
over so wide a range’ of conduct that it ‘embrace[s] an unlimited area of conduct.’” 
( (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 327, 337, 
quoting (1960) 1 Cal.3d 214, 224-225.)
The term “immoral” has been defined generally as that 
which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and 
contrary to good morals. Immorality has not been confined 
to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with 
rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity; 
dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct 
showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 5 members of the community, and as an inconsiderate 
attitude toward good order and the public welfare. 
(  (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811, quoting 
(1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 740 & 
(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 967, 972.)
Moreover, the definition of immoral or unprofessional 
conduct must be considered in conjunction with the unique 
position of public school teachers; upon whom are imposed 
“responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which 
do not exist in regard to other callings. 
( (2011) 194 
Cal.App.4th 1454, 1466, quoting  (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 
820, 824.) “Thus, the term must be ‘considered in the context in which the Legislature 
considered it, as conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the general public . . . more 
specifically in this case, conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the school 
community.’” ( , , 53 Cal.App.5th at p. 337, quoting , , 1 
Cal.3d at p. 224.)
The parties’ written submissions and oral arguments have been considered. The 
District alleged sufficient facts in the Statement of Charges that, if true, would 
constitute immoral conduct and support immediate suspension under section 44939, 
subdivision (b). Accordingly, the Motion must be denied.

// 6 ORDER
The Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension is DENIED.
