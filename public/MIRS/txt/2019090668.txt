and 

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, Responding Party 

OAH Case No. 2019090668 

ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 

SUSPENSION 

Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Tiffany King, Office of Administrative Hearings 

(OAH), State of California, heard this matter telephonically from Sacramento, California 

on October 18, 2019. 

Shirley Lee, Attorney at Law, represented Carlos Santibanez. 

Susan Hyman, Assistant General Counsel, represented Los Angeles Unified 

School District (District). 

PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

On May 17, 2019, the District’s Assistant Chief Human Resources Officer signed 

the Statement of Charges against Mr. Santibanez, a permanent certificated employee, 

based on charges of including, but not limited to, immoral conduct and willful refusal 

to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed by reasonable 

rules and regulations of the District. (Ed. Code, §§ 44932, subd. (a), & 44939, subd. (b).) 

Based upon the foregoing charges, the District’s governing board immediately 

suspended Mr. Santibanez without pay pursuant to Education Code section 44939. Mr. 

Santibanez timely filed a Demand for Hearing and Notice of Defense. 

On September 18, 2019, Mr. Santibanez filed a Notice of Motion and Motion for 

Immediate Reversal of Suspension (Motion) pursuant to Education Code section 

44939, subdivision (c), on grounds that the Statement of Charges does not set forth a 

sufficient basis for immediate unpaid suspension. Specifically, Mr. Santibanez argues 

that the well-pleaded allegations demonstrate conduct that was unprofessional or 

unsatisfactory, at most but did not rise to the level of immoral conduct and/or willful 

refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause justifying an 

immediate unpaid suspension. 

DISCUSSION 

Education Code section 44939 states, in relevant part, that a school district may 

immediately suspend a permanent employee of the school district who has been 

charged “with immoral conduct, conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral 

turpitude, with incompetency due to mental disability, with willful refusal to perform 

regular assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed by reasonable rules and 

 

2 

regulations of the employing school district, or with violation of [Education Code] 

section 51530.” (Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (b).) “Review of a motion filed pursuant to 

this section shall be limited to a determination as to whether the facts as alleged in the 

statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate 

suspension under this section.” (Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (c).) 

“Immoral conduct” is to be construed according to “its common and approved 

usage having regard for the context in which the legislature used” the term. (Palo 

Verde Unified School District of Riverside County v. Hensey (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 967, 

971.) In Board of Education of the San Francisco Unified School District v. Weiland 

(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811, the court held: 

The term “immoral” has been defined generally as that 

which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and 

contrary to good morals. Immorality has not been confined 

to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with 

rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, 

dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct 

showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 

members of the community, and as an inconsiderate 

attitude toward good order and the public welfare. 

Although not defined by the statute, “willful refusal” connotes an intentional 

failure to perform a certain act. Case law has held that declining an employer’s lawful 

directions, without reason, is sufficient to establish “willful refusal.” (See, e.g., Wilbur v. 

Office of City Clerk (1956) 143 Cal.App.2d 636, 642 [employee who did not attribute 

his refusals to illness and made no showing of willingness to comply with the 

reasonable orders of his superiors demonstrated “willful refusal to obey the reasonable 

 

3 

orders of an employer”]; Flowers v. State Personnel Board, 174 Cal.App.3d 753, 760 

[employee’s repeated refusal to undergo a medical examination or sobriety test, as 

directed by his employer, supported a charge of insubordination].) 

The Statement of Charges alleges that Mr. Santibanez injured a student’s hand 

when he attempted to take away the student’s cell phone, and includes varying 

accounts as to how the injury occurred. Additionally, the Statement of Charges alleges 

numerous instances of deficient performance, including failure to submit lesson plans 

on some occasions, deliver appropriate lessons, monitor students and correct their 

behavior, and ask higher-level depth of knowledge questions. 

The ALJ has considered the written submissions of the parties and oral 

argument. Based upon a review of the Statement of Charges, the School District failed 

to allege facts, which, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate 

suspension under Education Code section 44939, subdivision (b). 

ORDER 

Good cause having been established, the Motion for Immediate Reversal of 

Suspension is GRANTED. The School District shall make Mr. Santibanez whole for any 

lost wages, benefits, and compensation within 14 days after service of this Order. (Ed. 

Code, § 44939, subd. (c)(5).)
