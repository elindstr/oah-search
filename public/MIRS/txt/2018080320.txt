MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE 
REVERSAL OF SUSPENSION 
(Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (c)(4)) 

 
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Dena Coggins, Office of Administrative Hearings, 

State of California, heard this matter telephonically from Sacramento, California, on 
September 7, 2018. 

 
Attorney Ann Hendrix represented Yen La. 

Attorney Margaret Chidester represented Fontana Unified School District (School 

 

District). 
 

PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

On July 11, 2018, the Board of Education for the School District approved charges for 

  
 
dismissal against Mr. La based on causes that included, but were not limited to, willful 
refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause under Education Code 
section 44939.  On the same day, the Board of Education suspended Mr. La from his duties 
without pay.  On July 12, 2018, the School District served Mr. with the written Statement of 
Charges.  On July 27, 2018, Mr. La requested a hearing to contest the suspension and 
dismissal charges. 
 
 
(Motion) with OAH, pursuant to Education Code section 44939, subdivision (c)(1), alleging 

On August 9, 2018, Mr. La filed a Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension 

                                                 

1 This order has been amended to reflect the correct case number. 

1 

that the School District failed to state facts sufficient to support the ground of “willful refusal 
to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause.” 2   
 

 
DISCUSSION 

Education Code section 44939 states, in relevant part, that a school district may 

 
 
immediately suspend a permanent employee of the school district who has been charged 
“with immoral conduct, conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude, 
with incompetency due to mental disability, with willful refusal to perform regular 
assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed by reasonable rules and regulations of 
the School District, or with violation of [Education Code] section 51530.” (Ed. Code, § 
44939, subd. (b).) 
 
Under Education Code section 44939, subdivision (c)(1), “review of a motion filed 
 
pursuant to this section shall be limited to a determination as to whether the facts as alleged 
in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate 
suspension under this section.” 
 

The ALJ has considered the written submissions of the parties and oral argument.  
Based upon a review of the Statement of Charges, the School District failed to allege facts 
which, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate suspension under Education 
Code section 44939, subdivision (b). 

 
 

ORDER 
 

GOOD CAUSE HAVING BEEN ESTABLISHED, the Motion for Immediate 

Reversal of Suspension is GRANTED. 
 
  
The School District shall make the employee whole for any lost wages, benefits, and 
compensation within 14 days after service of this Order. (Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (c)(5).)

Cal.3d 194, 215, alleging that Mr. La was not afforded his rights under Skelly.  As the instant 
hearing was being heard pursuant to Education Code section 44939, no finding was made as 
to this issue.
