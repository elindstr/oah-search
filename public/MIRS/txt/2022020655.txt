BEFORE THE 
OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 

In the Matter of the Motion for Immediate Reversal of 

Suspension Filed by:  

NICHOLAS TEDESCO, A Permanent Certificated Employee, 

Moving Party  

v. 

NAPA VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, Responding Party 

OAH No. 2022020655 

ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 

SUSPENSION 

Timothy J. Aspinwall, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), Office of Administrative 

Hearings (OAH), State of California, heard this matter telephonically from Sacramento, 

California, on March 18, 2022.

Costa Kerestenzis, Attorney at Law, represented Nicholas Tedesco (Employee). 

Conor Kennedy, Attorney at Law, represented Napa Valley Unified School 

District (NVUSD). 

PROCEDURAL HISTORY  

On January 5, 2022, the NVUSD assistant superintendent signed a written 

Statement of Charges and Recommendation for Dismissal (Statement of Charges), 

charging Employee with immoral conduct; unprofessional conduct; dishonesty; evident 

unfitness for service; and persistent violations or refusal to obey school laws or 

reasonable regulations. On January 21, 2022, the NVUSD assistant superintendent 

provided to Employee a written Notice of Immediate Suspension and Intent to 

Dismiss, with the Statement of Charges attached, stating that based upon the 

foregoing charges, the NVUSD governing board voted on January 20, 2022, to 

immediately suspend Employee from his duties without pay. 

On February 17, 2022, Employee filed a Motion for Immediate Reversal of 

Suspension (Motion) with OAH, pursuant to Education Code section 44939, subdivision 

(c), alleging that the Statement of Charges does not set forth a sufficient basis for 

immediate suspension because the allegations in the Statement of Charges do not rise 

to the level of immoral conduct.   

DISCUSSION 

Education Code section 44939 states, in relevant part, that a school district may 

immediately suspend a permanent employee of the school district who has been 

charged with, among other things, immoral conduct. (Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (b).)

Under Education Code section 44939, subdivision (c)(1), “review of a motion 

filed pursuant to this section shall be limited to a determination as to whether the 

2

facts as alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis 

for immediate suspension under this section.”

The ALJ has considered the Statement of Charges, and the parties’ written and 

oral arguments. Based upon a review of the Statement of Charges, the NVUSD has 

alleged facts which, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate 

suspension under Education Code section 44939, subdivision (b).

GOOD CAUSE NOT HAVING BEEN ESTABLISHED, the Motion for Immediate 

Reversal of Suspension is DENIED.
