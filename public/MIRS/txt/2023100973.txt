BEFORE THE 
OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 

In the Matter of the Motion for Immediate Reversal of 

Suspension of: 

JULIE PEACOCK, a Permanent Certificated Employee, 

Moving Party, 

v. 

PERRIS UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT, 

Responding Party. 

OAH No. 2023100973 

ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 

SUSPENSION 

Irina Tentser, Administrative Law Judge, Office of Administrative Hearings 

(OAH), State of California, heard oral argument on this matter on November 27, 2023. 

Carlos R. Perez, Attorney, Law Office of Carol R. Perez, represented moving 

party Julie Peacock (Peacock). 

Amanda S. Georgino, Attorney, Fagen Friedman & Fulfrost, LLP, represented 

Perris Union School District (District). 

Procedural History 

On September 28, 2023, the District served Peacock with a Statement of 

Charges, immediately suspending her without pay and providing her with notice of its 

intent to dismiss her as a permanent certificated teacher. (Ed. Code, § 44932.) (All 

further statutory references are to the Education Code, unless otherwise noted.) 

Peacock timely filed a Demand for Hearing and Notice of Defense. The hearing has not 

yet been scheduled. 

On October 31, 2023, Peacock filed a Notice of Motion and Motion for 

Immediate Reversal of Suspension (Motion) to challenge her immediate suspension 

without pay. (§ 44939, subd. (c).) Peacock contends the Statement of Charges does not 

set forth a sufficient basis for immediate unpaid suspension. Specifically, Peacock 

asserts the allegations do not rise to the level of “immoral conduct” and therefore do 

not justify an immediate unpaid suspension. (§ 44939, subd. (b).) 

On November 13, 2023, the District filed an Opposition to the Motion. No Reply 

was filed by Peacock. On November 21, 2023, the District filed a Notice of Errata re 

District Opposition and a Corrected Opposition to the Motion. Oral argument on the 

Motion was originally scheduled for November 22, 2023. Oral argument was continued 

to November 27, 2023, to provide Respondent sufficient time to review and respond 

to the District’s November 21, 2023, Corrected Opposition to the Motion. No Reply to 

the District’s Corrected Opposition was filed by Peacock. The hearing on the Motion 

occurred on November 27, 2023. The parties submitted on the filed papers.

Based on the reasoning set forth below, the Motion is denied because the facts 

alleged in the Statement of Charges are sufficient to support a charge of immoral 

conduct. Peacock’s immediate unpaid suspension shall, therefore, remain in effect. 

Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension 

Section 44939, subdivision (b), allows a school district to immediately suspend a 

permanent employee without pay who has been charged with, among other things, 

immoral conduct. An employee who has been placed on such suspension may, 

however, file a motion for immediate reversal of suspension (MIRS). (§ 44939, subd. 

(c)(1).) In reviewing a MIRS, the review “shall be limited to a determination as to 

whether the facts as alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to 

constitute a basis for immediate suspension under this section.” (Ibid.) 

STATEMENT OF CHARGES 

Peacock was assigned as an English Language Arts teacher at Heritage High 

School. The District alleges multiple instances of conduct by Peacock between January 

2020 and December 2022 including, but not limited to: calling students “turds;” 

regularly telling students to “[S]hut up” and/or “Shut up, idiots”; telling a student, “ . . 

.I’ll punch you in the throat” if the student gave their notes to another student; using 

profanity in front of students on multiple occasions; and simulating “suicide and self-

harm in front of your students by pretending to place a lanyard around your neck and 

pretending to stab yourself with your keys.” (Statement of Charges, ¶¶ 17-18.) 

IMMORAL CONDUCT 

“[T]he term ‘immoral conduct’ in section 44932, subdivision (a)(1), ‘stretch[es] 

over so wide a range’ of conduct that it ‘embrace[s] an unlimited area of conduct.’”

(Crawford v. Commission on Professional Competence (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 327, 337, 

quoting Morrison v. State Board of Education (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 224-225.) 

The term “immoral” has been defined generally as that 

which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and 

contrary to good morals. Immorality has not been confined 

to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with 

rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, 

dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct 

showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 

members of the community, and as an inconsiderate 

attitude toward good order and the public welfare. 

(Board of Education v. Weiland (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811, quoting Orloff v. Los 

Angeles Turf Club (1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 740 and Palo Verdes Unified School District of 

Riverside v. Hensey (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 967, 972.) 

Moreover, the definition of immoral or unprofessional 

conduct must be considered in conjunction with the unique 

position of public school teachers, upon whom are imposed 

“responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which 

do not exist in regards to other callings.” 

(San Diego Unified School Dist. V. Commission on Professional Competence (2011) 

194 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1466, quoting Board of Trustees v. Stubblefield (1971) 16 

Cal.App.3d 820, 824.) “Thus, the term must be ‘considered in the context in which the 

Legislature considered it, as conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the general 

public . . . more specifically in this case, conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the 

4 

school community.’” (Crawford, supra, 53 Cal.App.5th at p. 337, quoting Morrison, 

supra, 1 Cal.3d at p. 224.) 

Analysis – Immoral Conduct 

The allegations Peacock engaged in misconduct in her actions towards students 

could support a finding of immoral conduct if proven at hearing. (Accordingly, the 

remaining allegations, such as Peacock’s actions at a January 27, 2020 English 

department meeting and September 10, 2020 video posting to Peacock’s then-public 

Instagram account, are not relevant to this analysis.) 

The parties’ written submissions have been considered. The District alleged 

sufficient facts in the Statement of Charges that, if true, would constitute a basis for 

immediate suspension based on immoral conduct, pursuant to section 44939, 

subdivision (b). The Motion is therefore denied. 

ORDER 

The Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension is denied. The immediate 

suspension without pay shall remain in effect.
