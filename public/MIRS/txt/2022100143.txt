Hearings (OAH), State of California, heard oral argument on this matter by telephone 

on October 28, 2022. 

Matthew Chevedden, Attorney at Law, Langenkamp, Curtis, Price, Lindstrom and 

Chevedden, represented moving party Carlene Ranzieri (Ranzieri). 

Gabriela Flowers and Andrew Blan, Attorneys at Law, Lozano Smith, represented

The matter was submitted for decision on October 28, 2022. 

Procedural History

On September 28, 2022, the District served Ranzieri with a Statement of 

Charges (Charges), immediately suspending her without pay and providing her notice 

of its intent to dismiss her as a permanent certificated teacher. (Ed. Code1, § 44932.)

On October 6, 2022, Ranzieri timely filed a Demand for Hearing and Notice of Defense. 

The hearing is set for March 6 through 10, 2023. 

On October 6, 2022, Ranzieri filed a Notice of Motion and Motion for 

Immediate Reversal of Suspension (Motion) to challenge her immediate suspension 

without pay, along with a Memorandum of Points and Authorities and exhibits. 

(§ 44939, subd. (c).) Ranzieri alleges her Motion should be granted because:

(1) there is no evidence the school board approved the Charges by majority 

vote, as required by section 44939, subdivision (b); 

(2) the allegations, if taken as true, do not set forth a sufficient basis to prove 

immoral conduct, pursuant to sections 44932, subdivision (a)(1) and 44939; and 

(3) there have been no new findings made against her by the District after she 

was warned about her unprofessional conduct or unsatisfactory performance in 

February 2022, only an unfounded allegation made in a Sacramento Employment and 

1 All further statutory references are to the Education Code, unless otherwise 

specified.

Training Agency (SETA) letter to the District, making the charges unsupported under 

section 44938, subdivision (a).

The District filed an Opposition to the Motion on October 17, 2022, along with a 

declaration and exhibits in support thereof. Ranzieri filed a Reply on October 24, 2022. 

Oral argument on the Motion was heard on October 28, 2022. 

Motion For Immediate Reversal Of Suspension 

Section 44939 allows a school district to immediately suspend a permanent 

employee without pay who has been charged with, among other things, immoral 

conduct. (subd. (b).) However, an employee who has been placed on such suspension 

may file a motion for immediate reversal of suspension. (§ 44939, subd. (c)(1).) “Review 

of a motion filed pursuant to this section shall be limited to a determination as to 

whether the facts as alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to 

constitute a basis for immediate suspension under this section.” (

.) 

STATEMENT OF CHARGES

The Charges allege, on October 21, 2021, Ranzieri, a child development teacher 

at Parkway Preschool, pushed a child, failed to ensure a child was properly clothed (by 

not meeting the child’s diapering needs), deprived at least one child of drinking water, 

threw a child’s food away before they finished eating, and raised her voice to students 

and staff. Thereafter, the District provided Ranzieri with a Notice of Unprofessional 

Conduct and Unsatisfactory Performance on February 23, 2022, documenting her 

October 21, 2021 conduct and directing her to, among other things, “a. Follow 

Department Policies and Procedures and State Licensing regulations regarding 

supervision of children; b. Treat all students and staff with respect; [and] c. Refrain 

3

from pushing students.” However, on May 23, 2022, the District alleges Ranzieri 

pushed another student. 

IMMORAL CONDUCT 

“[T]he term ‘immoral conduct’ in section 44932, subdivision (a)(1) ‘stretch[es] 

over so wide a range’ of conduct that it ‘embrace[s] an unlimited area of conduct.’” 

(

(

(2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 327, 337, quoting 

 (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 224–225.) 

The term “immoral” has been defined generally as that 

which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and 

contrary to good morals. Immorality has not been confined 

to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with 

rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, 

dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct 

showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 

members of the community, and as an inconsiderate 

attitude toward good order and the public welfare.

 (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811, quoting 

(1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 740 and 

 (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 967, 972.) 

Moreover, the definition of immoral or unprofessional 

conduct must be considered in conjunction with the unique 

position of public school teachers, upon whom are imposed 

“responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which 

do not exist in regard to other callings.”

4

(

(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 

1454, 1466, quoting 

 (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 820, 824.) 

“Thus, the term must be ‘considered in the context in which the Legislature considered 

it, as conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the general public . . . more specifically 

in this case, conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the school community.’” 

(

53 Cal.App.5th at p. 337, quoting 

 1 Cal.3d at p. 224.) 

Analysis 

Causing harm to a child, especially by one charged to protect the same, is 

hostile to the welfare of the child and the school community. Pushing a child, failing to 

ensure a child is properly clothed (by not meeting the child’s diapering needs), 

depriving at least one child of drinking water, throwing a child’s food away before they 

have finished eating, and raising a voice to students and staff can each be considered 

immoral conduct. As such, if proven at hearing, the allegations of misconduct 

contained in the Charges could support a finding of immoral conduct. 

The parties’ written submissions and oral argument have been considered. The 

District alleged sufficient facts in the Charges that, if true, would constitute a basis for 

immediate suspension based on immoral conduct under section 44939, subdivision 

(c)(1). As such, the Motion must be denied. 

All other arguments not specifically mentioned herein have been considered 

and rejected.
