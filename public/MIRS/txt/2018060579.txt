PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

 
On May 15, 2018, the Governing Board of the District (Governing Board) approved 

 
the Statement of Charges and Recommendation for Dismissal and Immediate Unpaid 
Suspension of Mr. Martinez, based on causes including, but not limited to, immoral conduct 
under Education Code section 44939.  On May 16, 2018, the Governing Board gave notice to 
Mr. Martinez of its decision and placed him on immediate suspension without pay pursuant 
to Education Code section 44939.  On or about May 17, 2018, the Governing Board received 
Mr. Martinez’s demand for a hearing.     
 
 
 
On June 13, 2018, Mr. Martinez filed a Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension 
(Motion), pursuant to Education Code section 44939, subdivision (c)(1), contending that the 

Statement of Charges does not set forth a sufficient basis for immediate suspension because 
the allegations therein do not rise to the level of immoral conduct.  
 

 
DISCUSSION 

Education Code section 44939 states, in relevant part, that a school district may 

 
 
immediately suspend a permanent employee of the school district who has been charged 
“with immoral conduct, conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude, 
with incompetency due to mental disability, with willful refusal to perform regular 
assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed by reasonable rules and regulations of 
the School District, or with violation of [Education Code] section 51530.” (Ed. Code, § 
44939, subd. (b).) 
 
Under Education Code section 44939, subdivision (c)(1), “review of a motion filed 
 
pursuant to this section shall be limited to a determination as to whether the facts as alleged 
in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate 
suspension under this section.” 
 

The ALJ has considered the written submissions of the parties and oral argument.  
Based upon a review of the Statement of Charges, the District has alleged facts which, if 
true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate suspension under Education Code 
section 44939, subdivision (b). 

 

 
GOOD CAUSE NOT HAVING BEEN ESTABLISHED, the Motion is DENIED.
