In the Matter of the Motion for Immediate Reversal of 

TYRONE LIDDELL, A Permanent Certified Employee, 

Suspension of: 

Moving Party, 

v. 

HEMET UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, Responding Party. 

OAH No. 2021050589 

ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 

SUSPENSION 

Ji-Lan Zang, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), Office of Administrative Hearings 

(OAH), State of California, heard this matter by telephone on June 11, 2021, in Los 

Angeles, California. 

Jon Cadieux, Attorney at Law, represented moving party Tyrone Liddell 

(Employee). David E. Robinett, Attorney at Law, represented responding party Hemet 

Unified School District (District). 

District has suspended Employee without pay pending the outcome of its action 

to dismiss Employee.1 The basis for the suspension under Education Code2 section 

44939 is willful refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause, as 

prescribed by reasonable rules and regulations of the employing school district.  On 

March 18, 2021, Employee filed a motion (Motion) seeking an order for the immediate 

reversal of his suspension. On June 1, 2021, District filed an opposition (Opposition) to 

the Motion. On June 8, 2021, Employee filed a reply. 

Having considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers filed by the parties, 

and the oral argument of counsel, the undersigned ALJ hereby finds and orders as 

follows: 

Section 44939 

1. 

Section 44939 authorizes the governing board of a school district, if it 

deems the action necessary, to immediately suspend a permanent employee from his 

or her duties, upon the filing of written charges with the governing board charging the 

employee with immoral conduct, conviction of a felony or any crime involving moral 

turpitude, incompetency due to mental disability, willful refusal to perform regular 

assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed by reasonable rules and 

regulations of the employing district, or violation of section 51530 (teaching 

communism). (§ 44939, subd. (b).) 

                                              

1 The dismissal action bears OAH No. 2021060060. 

2 All further statutory references are to the Education Code unless otherwise 

indicated. 

2 

2. 

An employee who is suspended pursuant to section 44939 may serve and 

file with OAH a motion for immediate reversal of suspension. The motion shall include 

a memorandum of points and authorities setting forth law and argument supporting 

the employee s contention that the statement of charges does not set forth a sufficient 

basis for immediate suspension.

§ 44939, subd. (c)(1).) Review of the motion  shall be 

limited to a determination as to whether the facts as alleged in the statement of 

charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate suspension under this 

section.

The Statement of Charges 

3. 

District seeks to dismiss Employee from his assignment as a chemistry 

teacher. The Statement of Charges alleges causes for dismissal, pursuant to section 

44932, for unprofessional conduct, dishonesty, unsatisfactory performance, evident 

unfitness for service, and persistent refusal to obey school laws and regulations. 

4. 

District s dismissal action against Employee consists of allegations of his 

poor or unsatisfactory performance as a classroom teacher during the 2019 to 2020 

and 2020 to 2021 school years. In general, Employee s performance deficiencies relate 

to areas including, but not limited to, refusal to contact parents of students who are 

failing or at risk of failing; refusal to return calls to parents or students; refusal to enter 

or update grades; refusal to submit lesson plans; failure to submit collaboration 

meeting minutes; failure to timely respond to District emails and failure to appear at 

scheduled meetings; failure to timely submit administrative documents; improper 

storage of chemicals; noncompliance with directives; and dishonesty. 

5. 

In the Statement of Charges, the sole basis alleged for Employee s 

suspension under section 44939 is willful refusal to perform regular assignments 

3 

without reasonable cause. According to District, the following allegations contained in 

the Statement of Charges establish Employee s willful refusal: 

  Employee did not attempt to contact 53 students who earned a "D" or 

"F" during the 2020 to 2021 school year for the purpose of providing 

academic intervention, despite numerous prior directives to do so (SOC, ¶ 

4);3 

  Employee did not return calls or emails to parents or students, in some 

cases requiring multiple prompts over multiple weeks or months before 

doing so (

 at ¶ 5); 

  Employee failed to follow numerous directives to input, update, and 

finalize student grades in a timely manner (

 at ¶ 5); 

  Employee did not turn in any lesson plans for the 2020 to 2021 school 

year (

 at ¶ 7); 

  Employee did not provide agenda minutes for his Wednesday 

collaboration meetings on several occasions dating back to the 2019 to 

2020 school year (

 at ¶ 8); 

  Employee did not turn in his weekly Time Value Certification documents 

between October 16 and December 14, 2020 (

 at ¶ 10(a)); and 

                                              

3 References to specific paragraphs of the Statement of Charges are indicated 

by  SOC  followed by the paragraph number. 

4 

  Employee did not turn in his Weekly Attendance Reports for the periods 

of August 21 to September 24, 2020; October 7 to 14, 2020; and 

November 2 to December 7, 2020 (

 at ¶ 10(b)). 

(Opposition, pp. 5-6.) 

The Parties Contentions 

6. 

Section 44939 limits the grounds for immediate suspension of a teacher 

to instances of  willful refusal

to perform regular assignments without reasonable 

cause. Employee contends that the allegations contained in the Statement of Charges 

fall within the meaning of  persistent refusal  to obey the school laws and regulations 

under section 44932, subdivision (a)(8),4 but they do not constitute  willful refusal

to 

perform regular assignments without reasonable cause under section 44939, 

subdivision (b). (Motion, pp. 2-4.) According to Employee,  willful refusal under 

                                              

4 Section 44932, subdivision (a)(8), states: 

(a) A permanent employee shall not be dismissed except for 

one or more of the following causes: 

[¶]. . . .[¶] 

her. 

(8) Persistent violation of or refusal to obey the school laws 

of the state or reasonable regulations prescribed for the 

government of the public schools by the state board or by 

the governing board of the school district employing him or 

5 

section 44939 is not the same as  persistent refusal under section 44932, which 

provides grounds for only dismissal, but not immediate suspension, of a teacher. (

.) 

7. 

In its oral argument during the hearing, District contended that the 

critical distinction between sections 44939, subdivision (b), and 44932, subdivision 

(a)(8), is not whether Employee s refusal is  willful or  persistent, but whether 

Employee refused to perform his regular assignments as a chemistry teacher (section 

44939, subdivision (b)) or obey the school laws and regulations (section 44932, 

subdivision (a)(8).) District further contended that even if willfulness is the 

distinguishing feature of section 44939, subdivision (b), Employee s willful refusal may 

be inferred from his repeated failure to perform his assigned tasks, despite numerous 

directives from District. 

Statutory Construction 

8. 

District s first contention, that it matters little whether an employee s 

refusal is  willful or  persistent, entirely disregards the word  willful  used in section 

44939, subdivision (b), rendering it surplusage.  It is a settled axiom of statutory 

construction that significance should be attributed to every word and phrase of a 

statute, and a construction making some words surplusage should be avoided.  

(

 (

) (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1010; 

. (1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230.) Consequently, District s construction of 

section 44939, subdivision (b), is precluded because the statute requires the element 

of willfulness. 

9. 

District s second contention, that willfulness may be inferred from 

repeated failures to comply with directives, is also not persuasive. Because there is no 

case law interpreting the word  willful as it is used in section 44939, subdivision (b), its 

6 

meaning must be construed through legislative intent. To determine that intent,  The 

court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.

 (1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724, quoting 

 (1950) 35 Cal.2d 175, 182.) 

However, the concept of willfulness, as used in both penal and civil contexts, is 

nuanced. Penal Code section 7 states that 

t]he word  willfully when applied to the 

intent with which an act is done or omitted, implies simply a purpose or willingness to 

commit the act, or to make the omission in question. Notwithstanding this definition, 

willfulness has also been interpreted to imply more than the intentional doing of a 

negligent act. (

 (1991) 52 Cal.3d 1009, 1020 1021.) 

While willfulness may not require a guilty intent on the part of the perpetrator, it 

nevertheless applies to acts that are  conscious, intentional and deliberate.  (

 (

) (1958) 157 Cal.App.2d 252, 257.) As the court 

noted in 

t]he word  willful

is used in different statutes with various shades 

of meaning.

. at p. 256.) There is no  universal formula that defines the word 

willful and its meaning must be determined  in the context of the particular statute 

being considered.

Cal.App.4th 174, 183.) 

 (1994) 23 

10. 

Turning then to the statutory framework, the Education Code establishes 

two separate schemes for dismissals under section 44932, and immediate suspensions 

under section 44939. Section 44932 enumerates 11 separate causes for teacher 

dismissals, including immoral conduct, unprofessional conduct, and alcoholism, among 

others. However, under section 44939, a teacher may be immediately suspended 

based only on the five grounds which are described above. Specifically, many of the 

causes for dismissal under section 44932, such as dishonesty, unfitness to teach, and 

unsatisfactory performance, cannot form the grounds for immediate suspension under 

section 44939. 

7 

11. 

The Education Code also sets forth different procedural requirements for 

dismissals and immediate suspensions. For example, under section 44938, subdivision 

(b), an employing district may not take action against an employee charged with 

unsatisfactory performance pursuant to section 44932 without first having given at 

least 90 days written notice to the employee of the unsatisfactory performance with 

such specificity and particularity so as to  furnish the employee an opportunity to 

correct his or her faults and overcome the grounds for the charge.  (§ 44938, subd. 

(b).) There is a similar notice requirement when an employee is charged with 

unprofessional conduct pursuant to section 44932. (§ 44938, subd. (a).) Under section 

44939, the employing district may immediately suspend the employee, but the 

employee may also file a motion for immediate reversal within 30 days of service of 

the initial pleading. (§ 44939, subds. (a), (b), (c).) This remedy is unique to immediate 

suspension cases. 

12. 

Thus, the Education Code, in creating the separate grounds and 

procedures for cases involving dismissals generally and those involving immediate 

suspension, contemplates a clear distinction between two types of cases. Moreover, in 

narrowing the substantive grounds for immediate suspension and in creating 

additional due process protections for the employee under section 44939, the 

Legislature evidenced an intent to set a higher threshold for the employing district to 

justify immediately suspending a teacher without pay. 

13. 

Furthermore, although both sections 44932, subdivision (a)(8), and 

44939, subdivision (b), use the word  refusal

the dismissal statute uses the modifier 

persistent, and the immediate suspension statute uses the modifier  willful.   It is an 

equally settled axiom that when the drafters of a statute have employed a term in one 

place and omitted it in another, it should not be inferred where it has been excluded.  

8 

(

, 

, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1010; 

 (1983) 145 

Cal.App.3d 688, 691.) Therefore, the use of the word  willful

in section 44939 rather 

than  persistent

indicates that while repeated and persistent performance issues may 

establish grounds for dismissing a teacher under section 44932, they are not grounds 

for immediate suspension under section 44939. 

14. 

In light of the foregoing, the most reasonable interpretation of willfulness 

under section 44939 is that it implies more than the repeated doing of negligent acts.  

In support of his argument that accidental or negligent conduct cannot constitute 

willful refusal to perform regular assignments for purposes of section 44939, Employee 

cites to 

 (

) (1953) 41 Cal.2d 546. 

In 

, the court stated, 

t]he willful refusal of a teacher to obey the reasonable rules 

and regulations of the employing board of education is insubordination.  (

. at p. 

552.) Willfulness, therefore, requires an intentional and affirmative decision on the part 

of the teacher to refuse assignments and to engage in insubordination. 

15. 

This interpretation of the statute is consistent with prior case law 

requiring strict construction of teacher dismissal statutes. (

(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 784, 789.) Strict 

construction is warranted because teacher dismissal statutes  ha[ve] as a possible 

object the termination of employment of a permanent teacher. [A teacher s] right of 

continued employment is a valuable right.

.) Immediate suspension is an even 

more severe measure, in that the suspension of a teacher without pay pending the 

outcome of dismissal hearing involves the immediate deprivation of a valuable right. 

Under these circumstances, section 44939 must be strictly construed to set a higher 

threshold for establishing a case involving immediate suspension than that involving 

dismissal generally. Thus, absent compliance with the requirements of section 44939, 

9 

the Education Code does not contemplate immediate suspension based on a teacher s 

repeated failures to correct performance deficiencies. 

Analysis 

16. 

The Motion tests whether the alleged facts, if true, are  sufficient to 

constitute a basis for immediate suspension.

(§ 44939, subd. (c)(1).) In the Statement 

of Charges, the word  willful refusal

is used in several instances. However, the mere 

quoting of the statutory language is conclusory and insufficient to survive a motion for 

immediate reversal of suspension. (

 (2008) 164 

Cal.App.4th 629, 649; 

 (1932) 

120 Cal.App. 426, 429 431.) The allegations of Employee s refusal to comply with 

directives, as contained in the Statement of Charges, do not show a  willful refusal

to 

perform his regular assignment as a chemistry teacher. 

17. 

For example, with respect to the allegation that Employee failed to 

contact 53 students with failing grades, there is no allegation that Employee 

affirmatively refused to perform his duties without reasonable cause. When questioned 

by his principal about the lack of entries in Aeries (the school computer system) of his 

contacts with the 53 students, Employee responded that he  attempted to contact 

many of these families but were unable to reach them.

(SOC, ¶ 4(a).) In another 

instance, where the Statement of Charges alleges that Employee failed to enter grades 

into the Aeries system, there is no showing that Employee s failure was in fact, 

intentional or deliberate. The pleading states that on September 11, 2020, Employee 

blamed unspecified  technical difficulties for his failure to enter grades, but it does 

not establish when the grades were due or whether Employee ever entered the grades 

after receiving technical support from the school. (

. at ¶ 6(a).) 

10 

18. 

Similarly, allegations of Employee s insufficient or non-compliance with 

other directives and policies and procedures do not manifest a  willful refusal

to 

perform his duties, although some of the allegations show that Employee was 

repeatedly negligent in failing to complete his assignments on time. For example, 

Employee responded to his principal s request for a student s grade information but 

just did so late, approximately one week later. (SOC, ¶ 9c.) Employee also eventually 

complied with the school principal s directive to properly store chemicals in his 

classroom on November 18, 2020, albeit five days after the principal had notified him 

to do so by email. (

. at ¶ 11.) Moreover, District has not alleged any instances where 

Employee refused to accept an assignment, failed to come to work, or repudiated his 

supervisor s authority. 

Disposition 

19. 

Because the Statement of Charges does not allege sufficient facts 

demonstrating an intentional or affirmative decision on Employee s part to refuse 

performing his duties as a teacher, grounds for his immediate suspension have not 

been established. The ALJ finds that the facts alleged in the Statement of Charges, if 

true, are not sufficient to establish a basis for Employee s immediate suspension under 

section 44939. The Motion shall be granted.
