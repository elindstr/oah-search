v. 

Party 

OAH No. 2021020636 

WASHINGTON UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, Responding 

ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 

SUSPENSION 

Irina Tentser, Administrative Law Judge, Office of Administrative Hearings 

(OAH), State of California, heard oral argument on this matter by telephone on March 

19, 2021. 

Christopher O. Hammer, Attorney, Beeson, Tayer & Bodine, APC, represented 

moving party David Ionescu (Ionescu). 

Ingrid A. Meyers, Attorney, Dannis Woliver Kelley, represented Washington 

Unified School District (District). 

Procedural History 

On January 19, 2021, the District served Ionescu with a Statement of Charges, 

immediately suspending him without pay and providing him with notice of its intent to 

dismiss him as a permanent certificated teacher. (Ed. Code1, ยง 44932.) Ionescu timely 

filed a Demand for Hearing and Notice of Defense. The hearing has not yet been 

scheduled. 

On February 17, 2021, Ionescu filed a Notice of Motion and Motion for 

Immediate Reversal of Suspension (Motion) to challenge his immediate suspension 

without pay. (ยง 44939, subd. (c).) Ionescu contends the Statement of Charges does not 

set forth a sufficient basis for immediate unpaid suspension. Ionescu asserts the 

allegations may demonstrate conduct that was unprofessional but argues the same 

conduct does not rise to the level of immoral conduct justifying an immediate unpaid 

suspension. 

2021. 

On March 9, 2021, the District filed an Opposition to the Motion. Ionescu filed a 

Reply on March 16, 2021. Oral arguments on the Motion were heard on March 19, 

Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension 

Section 44939, subdivision (b), allows a school district to immediately suspend a 

permanent employee without pay who has been charged with, among other things, 

immoral conduct. An employee who has been placed on such suspension may, 

                                              

noted. 

1 All further statutory references are to the Education Code, unless otherwise 

2 

however, file a motion for immediate reversal of suspension (MIRS). (ยง 44939, subd. 

(c)(1).) In reviewing a MIRS, the review  shall be limited to a determination as to 

whether the facts as alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to 

constitute a basis for immediate suspension under this section.

.) 

STATEMENT OF CHARGES 

The District alleges multiple instances of conduct by Ionescu in 2019 and 2020 

including, but not limited to  repeatedly sending sexually suggestive and 

inappropriate communications to female students via electronic communications, 

asking students about their sexual experiences and if they will smoke marijuana with 

[Ionescu], attempting to be alone with a minor female student at school or [Ionescu s] 

home, and being dishonest with District administration in his communications with 

students, . . 

 (Paragraphs 1-16.) 

IMMORAL CONDUCT 

T]he term  immoral conduct in section 44932, subdivision (a)(1)  stretch[es] 

over so wise a range of conduct that it  embrace[s] an unlimited area of conduct.

(

quoting 

 (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 327, 337, 

 (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 224-225.) 

The term  immoral has been defined generally as that 

which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and 

contrary to good morals. Immorality has not been confined 

to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with 

rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, 

dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct 

showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 

3 

members of the community, and as an inconsiderate 

attitude toward good order and the public welfare. 

 (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811, quoting 

 (1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 740 and 

 (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 967, 972.) 

Moreover, the definition of immoral or unprofessional 

conduct must be considered in conjunction with the unique 

position of public school teachers, upon whom are imposed 

responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which 

do not exist in regards to other callings.  

(

(

194 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1466, quoting 

Cal.App.3d 

Thus, the term must be  considered in the context in which the 

Legislature considered it, as conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the general 

public . . . more specifically in this case, conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the 

school community.

Analysis 

The allegations Ionescu engaged in misconduct in his actions towards students 

could support a finding of immoral conduct if proven at hearing. 

The parties written submissions and oral argument have been considered. The 

District alleged sufficient facts in the Statement of Charges that, if true, would 

4 

constitute a basis for immediate suspension based on immoral conduct, pursuant to 

section 44939, subdivision (b). Accordingly, the Motion must be denied. 

ORDER 

The Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension is DENIED.
