PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 

On July 19, 2021, the County served Ms. Cain a  Notice of Intent to Dismiss; 

Placement on Immediate Unpaid Suspension Pending Outcome of Disciplinary 

Proceedings; and Statement of Charges for Dismissal.  The Statement of Charges 

alleges Ms. Cain engaged in immoral conduct (Ed. Code, §§ 44932, subdivision (a)(1), 

44939), dishonesty (

. at, subd. (a)(4)); persistent violation of or refusal to obey the 

school laws of the state or reasonable regulations prescribed by the government of 

the public schools by the state board or by the governing board of the school district 

(

. at subd. (a)(8)); and evident unfitness for service (

. at subd. (a)(6)). 

Education Code section 44939 allows a school district to immediately suspend a 

permanent employee without pay who has been charged with, among other things, 

immoral conduct. (

at subd. (b).) The County availed themselves of that provision 

and placed Ms. Cain on unpaid leave.  

On July 21, 2021, Ms. Cain filed the instant motion to immediately reverse her 

unpaid suspension, pursuant to Education Code section 44939, subdivision (c)(1). A 

review of a motion filed pursuant to this section  shall be limited to a determination as 

to whether the facts as alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to 

constitute a basis for immediate suspension under this section.

.) In other words, 

the review is limited to whether the conduct alleged could support a finding of 

immoral conduct. 

In the Statement of Charges, the County alleged 38 paragraphs containing 

various transgressions and failures to follow law, policy, or instructions. In general, the 

conduct alleged falls into the categories of being disrespectful to parents, students 

2 

and staff, and placing the health and safety of students at risk. The conduct includes, 

but is not limited to, the following (which are summarized): 

  From January through March 2020, Ms. Cain  crossed a boundary by telling 

a parent how to parent his or her child outside the classroom; failed to share 

pictures she had taken of that parent s child with the parent; and yelled at 

the parent. (Paragraph 2) 

  Allowed a child to attend class for at least seven days with an expired 

EpiPen, a lifesaving medication, which violated County procedures and 

placed the student at risk (Paragraph 3) 

  On February 10, 2021, had certain items that were poisonous to children (i.e. 

bleach, soaps, cleaning supplies and chemicals) in an unlocked cabinet and 

medication (antacid) in an unlocked drawer accessible to children, and in 

violation of child care licensing regulations (paragraphs 4 and 5) 

  Regularly rejecting medical accommodations for children made by parents 

and (paragraphs 11, 12) 

provided (paragraph 15) 

  Breach of lockdown procedures on March 31, 2021, no further description 

  Permitted a child who was coughing severely to remain in class on April 13 

and 14, 2021, and when realizing she needed to contact the office, notified 

the office that the parent of the child tried to give her an inhaler that 

morning for allergies but Ms. Cain refused to accept it due to improper 

paperwork (paragraphs 16 and 17)

(paragraph 19) 

so (paragraph 21) 

22) 

(paragraph 23) 

  On May 13, 2021, had expired Benedryl for a child in the first aid backpack 

  On September 25, 2019, failed to attend a meeting despite a request to do 

  Failure to log distance learning as required for April to June 2020 (paragraph 

  Failure to perform certain tasks relating to Individualized Education Plans 

  Failure to follow virtual meeting and IT notification requirements; failed to 

timely complete employee tasks in the portal; failed to assist a family in 

completing orientation; missing various deadlines; failing to maintain certain 

supplies in the classroom (paragraphs 24, 25, 26, 28 29, 30, 31) 

  On October 22, 2020, engaged in unprofessional classroom demeanor 1 

(paragraph 27) 

                                              

1 Apparently, Ms. Cain was leaving a voice mail for another individual at the 

school and thought she had hung up the phone; she did not. As Ms. Cain went on to 

teach her class,  unprofessional conduct could be heard. The  unprofessional 

conduct was not explained in the Statement of Charges; a transcript was noted as 

attached. However, while the transcript could have been incorporated by reference, 

none of the exhibits referred to in the Statement of Charges were provided to OAH.

  Not permitting perishable food to be placed in the refrigerator; permitting 

opened/uncovered milk and soda in the refrigerator (paragraphs 32, 35) 

  Using personal e-mail for confidential information and rearranging 

classroom furniture without permission (paragraphs 34, 36) 

IMMORAL CONDUCT 

[T]he term  immoral conduct  in section 44932, subdivision (a)(1)  stretch[es] 

over so wide a range  of conduct that it  embrace[s] an unlimited area of conduct.

 (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 327, 337, 

quoting 

 (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 224-225.) 

(

(

The term  immoral has been defined generally as that 

which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and 

contrary to good morals. Immorality has not been confined 

to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with 

rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, 

dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct 

showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 

members of the community, and as an inconsiderate 

attitude toward good order and the public welfare. 

 (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811, quoting 

 (1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 740 and 

 (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 967, 972.) 

Moreover, the definition of immoral or unprofessional 

conduct must be considered in conjunction with the unique 

5 

position of public school teachers, upon whom are imposed 

responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which 

do not exist in regard to other callings.  

(

 (2011) 194 

Cal.App.4th 1454, 1466, quoting 

 (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 

820, 824.)  Thus, the term must be  considered in the context in which the Legislature 

considered it, as conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the general public . . . more 

specifically in this case, conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the school 

community.

53 Cal.App.5th at p. 337, quoting 

 1 

Cal.3d at p. 224.) 

Conclusion 

The conduct, as alleged in the Statement of Charges and if assumed to be true, 

does not constitute  immoral conduct. Nothing, as pled, is inconsistent with rectitude, 

or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, dissoluteness; or willful, flagrant, or 

shameless conduct showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 

members of the community, or an inconsiderate attitude toward good order and the 

public welfare. While upon further proof at hearing Ms. Cain s conduct may indeed rise 

to that level, resolving a motion for immediate reversal of suspension is limited to the 

four corners of the Statement of Charges. Accordingly, Ms. Cain s motion is granted.
