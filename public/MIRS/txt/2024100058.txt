Suspension of: 
DONALD LOPERENA, a Permanent Certificated Employee, 
Moving Party 
and 
LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, 
Responding Party 
OAH Case No. 2024100058 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 
SUSPENSION 
Matthew S. Block, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), Office of Administrative 
Hearings (OAH), State of California, heard this matter by videoconference from 
Sacramento, California, on November 1, 2024. 
Jason Wojciechowski, Attorney at Bush Gottlieb, represented Donald Loperena
(Loperena), who was not present. 2 Brian Davenport, Assistant General Counsel II, represented the Los Angeles
Unified School District (District). 
Procedural History 
At all relevant times, Loperena served as a permanent certificated employee 
assigned as a high school physical education (P.E.) teacher at John F. Kennedy High 
School. On September 11, 2024, the District served Loperena with a Statement of 
Charges, dated August 28, 2024, which alleged cause to dismiss based on immoral 
conduct (Ed. Code, § 44932, subd. (a)(1))1; unprofessional conduct ( ., subd. (a)(2)); 
unsatisfactory performance ( ., subd. (a)(5)); evident unfitness for service ( ., subd. 
(a)(6)); persistent violation of or refusal to obey the school laws of the state or 
reasonable regulations prescribed for the government of the public schools by the 
state board or by the governing board of the school district employing him ( ., subd. 
(a)(8)); and willful refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause. 
(Ed. Code, § 44939.)
The Statement of Charges also alleged cause exists to immediately suspend 
Loperena without pay based on immoral conduct. (§ 44939, subd. (b).) Loperena timely 
filed a Request for Hearing. On October 2, 2024, Loperena also filed a Notice of 
Motion and Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension (Motion) pursuant to 
section 44939, subdivision (c), alleging that the Statement of Charges does not set 
forth a sufficient basis for immediate unpaid suspension because the allegations 
therein do not rise to the level of immoral conduct. The District filed its Opposition to 
 
1 All further statutory references are to the Education Code, unless otherwise 
specified.3 the Motion on October 22, 2024. Loperena filed a reply to the Opposition on October 
30, 2024. 
Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension 
Section 44939 states, in relevant part, that a school district may immediately 
suspend without pay a permanent employee of the school district who has been 
charged “with immoral conduct, conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral 
turpitude, with incompetency due to mental disability, with willful refusal to perform 
regular assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed by reasonable rules and 
regulations of the employing school district, or with violation of section 51530. . . .” (§ 
44939, subd. (b).) 
An employee who has been placed on such suspension may file a motion for 
immediate reversal of suspension. (§ 44339, subd. (c)(1).) “Review of a motion filed 
pursuant to this section shall be limited to a determination as to whether the facts as 
alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for 
immediate suspension under this section.” ( .) 
STATEMENT OF CHARGES
The District alleges multiple instances of misconduct between August 2022 and 
May 2023. The allegations can be divided into two broad categories: having 
inappropriate physical contact with female students; and making inappropriate or 
insensitive remarks to students. 
Examples of the first include Loperena: (1) having female students use an iPad 
to log laps they ran while he was seated with the iPad between his legs against his 
genitals; (2) sitting in front of female students with his legs spread open while they did 4 pushups; (3) holding the arms of a female student while she used an exercise machine; 
(4) placing his hands on the waist of a female student during a volleyball lesson; (5) 
touching a female student’s shoulder and lower back and moving his hand down her 
arms; (6) placing his hand on a female student’s shoulder while telling her he loved 
her; and (7) repeatedly poking a female student in the stomach while speaking with 
her. 
Examples of the second include Loperena: (1) telling students that overweight 
people cannot run; (2) telling students to run so they will “have a summer body”; (3) 
referring to female students as “my girls”; (4) telling female students they have “slutty 
mouths”; (5) complaining about people from Mexico coming to the United States and 
taking American jobs, and saying that they should go back to their own country; (6) 
telling a student she should go back to the kitchen and that she was not worth going 
to P.E.; and (7) referring to himself as “daddy” in front of his students. 
The District contends that immediate suspension without pay is warranted 
because Loperena’s behavior constitutes immoral conduct. 
IMMORAL CONDUCT 
“[T]he term ‘immoral conduct’ in section 44932, subdivision (a)(1) ‘stretch[es] 
over so wide a range’ of conduct that it ‘embrace[s] an unlimited area of conduct.’” 
( (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 327, 337, 
quoting (1960) 1 Cal.3d 214, 224-225.)
The term “immoral” has been defined generally as that 
which is hostile to the welfare of the general public and 
contrary to good morals. Immorality has not been confined 
to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with 5 rectitude, or indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity; 
dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct 
showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 
members of the community, and as an inconsiderate 
attitude toward good order and the public welfare.
(  (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811, quoting 
(1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 740 & 
(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 967, 972.)
Moreover, the definition of immoral or unprofessional 
conduct must be considered in conjunction with the unique 
position of public school teachers; upon whom are imposed 
responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which 
do not exist in regard to other callings.
( (2011) 194 
Cal.App.4th 1454, 1466, quoting  (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 
820, 824.) “Thus, the term must be ‘considered in the context in which the Legislature 
considered it, as conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the general public . . . more 
specifically in this case, conduct which is hostile to the welfare of the school 
community.’” ( , , 53 Cal.App.5th at p. 337, quoting , , 1 
Cal.3d at p. 224.) 
The parties’ written submissions and oral arguments have been considered. The 
District alleged sufficient facts in the Statement of Charges that, if true, would 
constitute immoral conduct and support immediate suspension under section 44939, 
subdivision (b). Accordingly, the Motion must be denied. 6 ORDER
The Motion for Immediate Reversal of Suspension is DENIED.
