PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

On December 18, 2018, a District representative served a statement of charges 

 
 
alleging cause to dismiss Nathan Willess from employment with the District as a 
mathematics teacher.  The charges include immoral conduct.  In reliance on this charge, the 
District has suspended respondent from employment without pay. 
 
 
his suspension and reinstating his salary and benefits pending resolution of the charges 
against him.  Respondent argues that the District has not alleged an adequate basis to suspend 
him from employment without pay before resolution of these charges, because the 
allegations do not describe immoral conduct.  The District opposes respondent’s motion. 
 

On January 17, 2019, respondent timely filed a motion seeking immediate reversal of 

 

APPLICABLE STATUTES 

 
 
Education Code section 44939 permits the District to suspend immediately, without 
pay, a permanent employee who the District alleges to have committed “immoral conduct.”  
(Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (b).)  Administrative review of an order for immediate suspension 
is available, but such review “shall be limited to a determination as to whether the facts 
alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate 
suspension under this section.”  (Id., subd. (c)(1).) 
 
 

CONCLUSION 

 
 
The statement of charges has been considered in light of the parties’ written and oral 
arguments.  The District has alleged facts which, if true, would establish immoral conduct.  
These allegations are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate suspension under 
Education Code section 44939, subdivision (b). 
 
 

ORDER 

 
 
The motion by respondent and moving party Nathan Willess for immediate reversal 
of suspension and for reimbursement of pay and benefits during the period of suspension is 
denied.
