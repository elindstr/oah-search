OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, 

Responding Party. 

OAH No. 2020110478 

ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR REVERSAL OF IMMEDIATE 

SUSPENSION (Ed. Code, ยง 44939, subd. (c)(4)) 

Administrative Law Judge Regina Brown, Office of Administrative Hearings, 

State of California, heard this matter telephonically, on December 18, 2020. 

Sarah Sandford-Smith, Attorney, represented the moving party Pauline Stangl. 

Joshua A. Stevens, Attorney, represented the Oakland Unified School District 

(District). 

PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

On October 14, 2020, a statement of charges and recommendation for dismissal 

and immediate unpaid suspension was filed and served against Pauline Stangl (moving 

party), pursuant to Education Code section 44932, alleging five causes for dismissal: 1) 

immoral conduct; 2) unprofessional conduct; 3) dishonesty; 4) evident unfitness for 

service; and 5) persistent violation of or refusal to obey school laws. The District placed 

her on immediate suspension without pay pursuant to Education Code section 44939, 

based upon the allegation of immoral conduct. 

The moving party filed a timely motion for immediate reversal of her 

suspension without pay, pursuant to Education Code section 44939, subdivision (c)(1). 

She argues that the District has not alleged a sufficient basis to place her on 

immediate unpaid status because the allegations in the statement of charges do not 

establish that she engaged in immoral conduct. 

DISCUSSION 

Education Code section 44939, subdivision (b), provides that a school district 

may immediately suspend a permanent employee who has been charged  with 

immoral conduct, conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude, with 

incompetency due to mental disability, with willful refusal to perform regular 

assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed by reasonable rules and 

regulations of the School District, or with violation of [Education Code] section

Pursuant to Education Code section 44939, subdivision (c)(1),  review of a 

motion filed pursuant to this section shall be limited to a determination as to whether 

the facts as alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a 

basis for immediate suspension under this section.  

The written submissions and oral argument of the parties have been considered. 

Based upon a review of the statement of charges, the District has failed to allege facts 

which, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate suspension under 

Education Code section 44939, subdivision (b), on the grounds of immoral conduct. 

Good cause having been established, the motion for immediate reversal of 

suspension is GRANTED. The District s immediate suspension of Pauline Stangl is 

reversed and the District shall make her whole for any lost wages, benefits, and 

compensation within 14 days after service of this Order. (Ed. Code, ยง 44939, subd.
