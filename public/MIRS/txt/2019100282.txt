State of California, heard this matter telephonically from Oakland, California, on November

Christopher Schumb, Attorney at Law, represented Michelle Agius. 

Gabriela D. Flowers and Erin M. Hamor, Attorneys at Law, Lozano Smith, 

represented the King City Union School District (District).   

 
 

PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

 
 
A statement of charges was filed and served against Michelle Agius, pursuant to 
Education Code section 44932, alleging five causes for dismissal: 1) immoral conduct; 
2) unprofessional conduct; 3) dishonesty; 4) unsatisfactory performance; 5) evident unfitness 
for service; and 6) persistent violation of or refusal to obey the school laws of the state or 
reasonable regulations prescribed for the government of the public schools by the State 
Board of Education or by the governing board of the school district employing her.  The 
District placed Agius on immediate suspension without pay under Education Code section 
44939, based upon the allegations of immoral conduct.     
 
 
Agius filed a timely motion for immediate reversal of her suspension without pay, 
pursuant to Education Code section 44939, subdivision (c)(1).  She argues that the District 

 

 

 

has not alleged a sufficient basis to place her on immediate unpaid status because the 
allegations in the statement of charges do not establish that she engaged in immoral conduct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 

  

 

 

 
DISCUSSION 

Education Code section 44939, subdivision (b), provides that a school district may 

 
 
immediately suspend a permanent employee of the school district who has been charged 
“with immoral conduct, conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude, 
with incompetency due to mental disability, with willful refusal to perform regular 
assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed by reasonable rules and regulations of 
the School District, or with violation of [Education Code] section 51530.”   
 
 
filed pursuant to this section shall be limited to a determination as to whether the facts as 
alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate 
suspension under this section.” 
 

Pursuant to Education Code section 44939, subdivision (c)(1), “review of a motion 

The written submissions and oral argument of the parties have been considered.  
Based upon a review of the statement of charges, the District has failed to allege facts which, 
if true, are sufficient to constitute a basis for immediate suspension under Education Code 
section 44939, subdivision (b), on the grounds of immoral conduct.  The facts alleged in the 
statement of charges may constitute grounds for discipline pursuant to Education Code 
section 44932, but do not describe immoral conduct.    

 
ORDER 

 
 
Good cause having been established, the motion for immediate reversal of suspension 
is GRANTED.  The District’s immediate suspension of Michelle Agius is REVERSED.  The 
District shall make her whole for any lost wages, benefits, and compensation within 14 days 
after service of this Order.  (Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (c)(5).)
