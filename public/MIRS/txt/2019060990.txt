In the Matter of the Motion for Immediate 
Reversal of Suspension Filed by: 

FARSHAD FARNOOSH, 
A Permanent Certificated Employee, 

Moving Party, 

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL 
DISTRICT, 

Responding Party. 

OAH No. 2019060990 
(Related Case No. 2019060112) 

ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR 
IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF 
SUSPENSION 
(Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (c)(4)) 

Administrative Law Judge Jill Schlichtmann, State of California, Office of 
Administrative Hearings, heard this matter telephonically on July 12, 2019, from Oakland, 
California. 
 

Erica Deutsch, Attorney at Law, represented respondent and moving party Farshad 

M. Cristina Cruz, Assistant General Counsel, represented the Los Angeles Unified 

Farnoosh. 
 

School District (District). 

Procedural History 
 

On April 26, 2019, a District representative served a statement of charges alleging 

cause to dismiss Farshad Farnoosh (respondent) from employment with the District as a 
seventh grade math teacher.  The District charges respondent with immoral conduct; 
unprofessional conduct; unsatisfactory performance; evident unfitness for service and 
persistent violation of, or refusal to obey, the school laws of the state or reasonable 
regulations; and willful refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause.  
Based on the charges, the District has suspended respondent from employment without pay. 
 

On July 10, 2019, respondent timely filed a motion seeking immediate reversal of his 

suspension and reinstating his salary and benefits pending resolution of the charges.   

Respondent argues that the District has not alleged an adequate basis to suspend him 
  
from employment without pay before resolution of these charges, because the allegations do 
not describe immoral conduct or the willful refusal to perform assignments.  Respondent 
requested that official notice be taken of a ruling in a motion for immediate reversal of 
suspension made in a case involving a different school district with distinct factual 
allegations.  The District opposes respondent’s motion and the request for official notice. 

 
During oral argument, the motion that official notice be taken was denied because the 

information offered was not relevant and the ruling was not precedential.   
 
Statutory Authority 
 

Education Code section 44939 permits the District to suspend immediately, without 

pay, a permanent employee who the District alleges to have committed “immoral conduct” or 
willfully refused to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause, as prescribed by 
reasonable rules and regulations of the District.  (Ed. Code, § 44939, subd. (b).)  The District 
may only take such action “if it deems that action necessary.”  (Ibid.)  Administrative review 
of an order for immediate suspension is available, but such review “shall be limited to a 
determination as to whether the facts alleged in the statement of charges, if true, are sufficient 
to constitute a basis for immediate suspension under this section.”  (Id., subd. (c)(1).) 
 
Conclusion 

 
The statement of charges has been considered in light of the parties’ written and oral 

arguments.  The District has alleged facts which, if true, would establish immoral conduct 
and/or the willful refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable cause, as 
prescribed by reasonable rules and regulations of the District.  These allegations are sufficient 
to constitute a basis for immediate suspension under Education Code section 44939, 
subdivision (b). 
 
 

ORDER 

 

The motion by respondent and moving party Farshad Farnoosh for immediate 
reversal of suspension and for reimbursement of pay and benefits during the period of 
suspension is denied.
