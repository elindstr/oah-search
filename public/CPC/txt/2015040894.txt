BEFORE  THE 
OFFICE  OF  ADMINISTRATIVE  HEARINGS 
STATE  OF  CALIFORNIA 

In  the  Matter  of  the  Accusation  Against: 

OAH  Case  No.  2015040894 

CARLOS  MENENDEZ,  a  Permanent 
Certificated  Employee, 

Respondent. 

  

DECISION 

The  hearing  in  the  above-captioned  matter  took  place  in  Los  Angeles  on  June 

1  and  2,  before  Joseph  D.  Montoya,  Administrative  Law  Judge  (ALJ),  Office  of 
Administrative  Hearings  (OAH).  Complainant  was  represented  by  My  T.  Huynh, 
Associate  General  Counsel,  Los  Angeles  Unified  School  District  (LAUSD  or 
District).  Respondent  Carlos  Menendez  appeared  and  represented  himself. 

The  record  was  held  open  for  the  submission,  by  the  District,  of  a  complete 

and  un-redacied  copy  of  an  investigation  report  generated  by  the  District  in  2014,  as 
Respondent  had  a  copy,  but  not  all  of  the  report  could  be  read.  The  document  was 
timely  received  as  exhibit  A,  and  has  been  sealed  with  a  protective  order. 

The  matter  was  submitted  for  decision  on  June  5,  2015.  The  ALJ  hereby 

makes  his  factual  findings,  legal  conclusions,  and  order. 

INTRODUCTION  AND  STATEMENT  OF  THE  CASE 

In  this  proceeding  the  District  seeks  the  termination  of  one  of  its  tenured 

teachers,  Respondent  Carlos  Menendez.  One  statutory  ground  for  termination  was 
alleged:  egregious  misconduct.  (Ed.  Code,  §§  44932,  subd.  (a)(1),  44939.1.)? 

In  the  main,  it  is  alleged  that  Respondent  touched  three  different  female  fifth 
grade  students  in  an  inappropriate  way;  that  he  grabbed  a  male  student  by  the  neck, 

' 

All  further  statutory  references  are  to  the  Education  Code  unless  otherwise 

noted.    

and  berated  him  for  not  being  able  to  write;  used  profanity  and  demeaned  females 
students;  and  failed  to  comply  with  a  directive  not  to  touch  students  even  if  he  was 
giving  them  praise.  The  directive  was  allegedly  given  to  Respondent  before  any  of 
the  alleged  acts  that  are  summarized  above. 

Respondent  provided  evidence  regarding  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the 
events  referenced  in  the  Accusation,  and  otherwise  provided  evidence  in  support  of 
his  retention  by  the  District. 

FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

The  Parties  and  Jurisdiction 

1. 

Complainant  Justo  H.  Avila  executed  the  Accusation  in  this  matter 

while  acting  in  his  official  capacity  as  Chief  Human  Resources  Officer  of  the  District. 

2. 

The  District  commenced  this  proceeding  on  March  27,  2015,  when 

Complainant  executed  a  Statement  of  Charges  against  Respondent.  Respondent  made 
a  timely  request  for  hearing,  which  led  to  the  issuance  of  the  Accusation.  He  then 
filed  a  Notice  of  Defense,  and  this  hearing  ensued.  All  jurisdictional  requirements 
have  been  met. 

3. 

Respondent  is  a  certificated  teacher  in  the  District's  employ, 

credentialed  to  teach  elementary  school  students.  During  the  time  relevant  to  this 
proceeding——in  the  main  from  August  2012  through  May  2013—Respondent  was 
assigned  to  teach  fifth  grade  students  at  Manchester  Elementary  School  (Manchester) 
in  Los  Angeles,  California. 

Findings  on  the  Factual  Allegations  Made  Against  Respondent 

4, 

During  the  period  August  2012  to  June  2013,  Respondent  had  physical 

contact  with  three  different  girls  who  were  enrolled  in  his  class,  which  contact  was 
questionable,  at  best 

5. 

(A)  On  one  occasion,  student  Ui.  Le  left  the  classroom  at  a 

break,  but  went  back  to  the  room  to  retrieve  something  from  her  backpack.  As  she 
was  bending  over  to  get  into  the  backpack,  Respondent  came  up  behind  her,  and 
placed  a  hand  on  her  buttocks. 

(B)  On  another  occasion,  while  LU 

was  seated  at  her  desk, 

Respondent  reached  around  toward  some  work  on  the  desk.  He  touched  the  girl  on 
the  breast,  for  a  period  of  time  indicating  that  the  touching  was  not  inadvertent. 

   

(C)  On  another  occasion,  Respondent  hugged  Lin  an  inappropriate 

way. 

6. 

(A)  During 

October  or  November  2012,  Respondent  had  physical 

.  She  was  seated  at  her  desk  (around  a  table  with  other 
contact  with  student 
students)  and  she  asked  for  help.  Respondent  placed  his  arm  around  her,  and  then 
briefly  touched  her  breast  while  seemingly  reaching  for  the  work  the  student  had 
performed. 

7, 

(A)  On  one  occasion,  on  a  date  not  clear  from  the  record,  but  during 
c.  (YER 
     

the  2012-2013  school  year,  Respondent  walked  by  student 
and  hit  her  on  the  buttocks  with  an  [Pad  that  he  was  carrying.  It  should  be  noted  that 
at  a  later  date,  YMMtold  detectives  from  the  Los  Angeles  Police  Department 
(LAPD)  that  she  felt  that  Respondent’s  act  was  not  deliberate.  (Ex.  A,  p.  5.) 

(B)  Although  not  alleged,  on  another  occasion,  Respondent  hit  Lion 

the  buttocks  with  an  IPad  as  he  walked  past  her. 

8. 

In  approximately  August  2012,  Respondent  had  inappropriate  contact 

with  student  MIBBBEV.,  because  he  came  up  behind  the  boy,  who  was 
underperforming,  grabbed  him  by  the  shoulders,  and  shook  him,  telling  the  student 
that  he—M 
traumatized  by  the  event.  Months  later,  when  interviewed  by  investigators  working 
for  the  District,  he  began  crying  when  asked  about  Respondent,  and  while  describing 
the  event. 

ould  do  better  than  he  was  doing  in  school.  The  boy  was 

9. 

At  times  during  the  2012-2013  school  year,  Respondent  used  profanity, 

or  vulgarity,  in  the  classroom  in  the  presence  of  his  fifth  grade  students.  He  also 
spoke  to  the  female  students  in  an  inappropriate  way.  On  one  occasion,  some  of  the 
girls  came  to  class  and  apparently  reeked  of  perfume.  Respondent  told  them  they 
should  not  “wear  that  ho  juice.”  This  tended  to  liken  them  to  prostitutes.  On  other 
occasions  he  admonished  the  girls  to  behave,  lest  they  end  up  like  the  streetwalkers 
that  plied  their  trade  on  nearby  Figueroa  Boulevard. 

10. 

(A)  In  April  2010  Respondent’s  supervisor,  the  principal  at 

Manchester,  Mr.  Hooker,  orally  directed  Respondent  not  to  touch  his  students. 
Thereafter,  on  May  20,  2010,  Mr.  Hooker  gave  Respondent  a  written  directive  not  to 
touch  a  student,  even  if  he  was  giving  them  praise.  That  directive  was  set  out  ina 
memo  that  summarized  the  meeting  when  the  directive  was  first  given.  In  that 
conference  memo,  Mr.  Hooker  stated  that  he  had  previously  directed  Respondent  “to 
no  longer  touch  a  student  even  if  you  are  giving  them  praise.”  (Ex.  5.)  Mr.  Hooker 
suggested  the  use  of  stickers  to  provide  approval  of  a  student’s  actions. 

(B)  Respondent’s  actions  described  in  Factual  Findings  5  through  8 

were  Contrary  to  the  prior  directive  from  the  principal.  The  directive  from  Mr. 

3 

   

Hooker  put  Respondent  on  notice  that  touching  the  students,  even  if  done  with  good 
intent,  could  be  readily  misconstrued. 

Findings  on  Other  Matters 

11. 

Two  of  the  girls  referenced  above,  Land  Yim 

testified  about  an 
event  that  provides  circumstantial  evidence  relevant  to  the  findings  made  above.  The 
event  was  not  pleaded,  but  was  described  in  the  course  of  testimony,  without 
objection. 

12. 

Respondent,  in  approximately  the  spring  of  2013  told  the  students  that 
each  was  to  write  a  letter  to  the  school  principal,  which  was  to  explain  why  they  did 
poorly  in  the-recent  standardized  testing.  This  was  treated  as a  class  project. 

13. 

Land  YR 

wrote  their  letters  to  Mr.  Hooker,  as  did  the  other 
students,  and  Respondent  collected  the  letters.  The  students  thought  that  the  letters 
were  actually  going  to  be  transmitted  to  the  principal.  Respondent  testified  that  such 
was  never  his  intent;  he  simply  wanted  the  students  to  use  some  introspection 
regarding  their  recent  performance  on  the  test.  However,  it  does  not  appear  he  shared 
his  intentions  for  the  letters  with  the  students,  who  therefore  set  forth  to  communicate 
with  the  principal  of  their  school. 

14.  —_  In  their  letters,  both  giris  made  it  clear  that  they  did  not  like  the  way 

Respondent  ran  his  classroom.  At  least  one  of  the  students  said  in  her  letter  that 
Respondent  was  a  pervert.”  When  Respondent  received  the  letters,  he  wrote  a  letter 
of  his  own  back  to  the  Land 
to  both  letters,  and  as  noted,  responded  to vi 
then  met  with  the  two  girls  about  the  matter. 

He  expressed  dismay  and  hurt  in  response

15.  _  Both  girls  credibly  testified  that  after  speaking  to  them  about  the 
matter,  Respondent  had  them  tear  up  their  letters  to  the  principal,  as  well  as  his  replies 
to  them.  No  copies  of  their  letters  were  preserved  or  provided  in  the  hearing. 
Respondent  did  not  provide  any  of  the  student  letters  to  the  principal.  He  stated  he 
kept  the  letters  for  a  time,  and  eventually 
provide  copies  of  his  letters  to  Yo  LM  found  in  exhibit  E.

16. 

The  student  witnesses  were  credible  in  their  demeanor  while  testifying. 

They  did  not  appear  to  bear  a  grudge  against  Respondent,  and  there  was  no  hint  of 
exaggeration  or  fabrication  of  charges.  However,  as  noted  in  the  District’s 
investigation  report,  exhibit  A,  YR  old  Los  Angeles  Police  Department 

  

*  The  testimony  by  the  two  girls  was  to  the  effect  that  both  called  him  a 
pervert.  In  his  replies  to  their  letters,  Respondent  addressed  the  matter  in  response  to

(LAPD)  investigators  she  did  not  see  Respondent  improperly  touch  anyone,  but  later 
told  the  District’s  investigators  that  she  saw  Respondent  touch  Lthree  or  four 
times.  (Ex.  A,  p.  14.)  On  the  other  hand,  Ldid  tell  LAPD  investigators  Respondent 
touched  her  buttocks,  as  set  out  in  Factual  Finding  5(A),  and  she  told  them  she  had 
been  touched  other  times.  (Lfwas  not  interviewed  by  District  investigators  because 
she  had  moved  out  of  California  for  a  time.) 

17. 

Interms  of  demeanor,  Respondent’s  testimony  appeared  credible.  It 

should  be  noted  that  his  version  of  events  surrounding  the  letters  from  the  class 
differed  when  he  spoke  to  the  LAPD,  as  opposed  to  when  he  discussed  the  matter 
with  the  District’s  investigators.  His  statements  to  the  LAPD  acknowledged  that  La 
or  YQ  had  called  him  a  pervert;  he  did  not  tell  the  District’s  investigators  that 
part  of  the  story. 

The  Morrison  Factors 

18 

Where  there  is  conduct  that  might  justify  termination  of  a  teacher,  an 

examination  must  be  made  of  whether  or  not  that  conduct  indicates  that  the  teacher  in 
question  is  unfit  to  teach.  This  requirement  was  first  set  forth  in  Morrison  v.  State 
Board  of Education  (1969)  1  Cal.3d  214,  229.  There  the  Supreme  Court  held  that 
factors  that  may  be  examined  to  determine  fitness  include  the  likelihood  that  the 
conduct  may  have  adversely  affected  students  or  fellow  teachers;  the  degree  of  such 
adversity  anticipated;  and,  the  proximity  or  remoteness  in  time  of  the  conduct.  Other 
factors  may  include  the  type  of  certificate  held  by  the  teacher;  extenuating  or 
aggravating  circumstances;  the  praiseworthiness  or  blameworthiness  of  the  motives 
resulting  in  the  conduct;  the  likelihood  that  the  conduct  in  question  will  recur;  and, 
the  extent  that  discipline  will  cause  an  adverse  or  chilling  impact  on  the  constitutional 
rights  of  the  teacher  involved,  or  other  teachers. 

19. 

(A)  Adverse  consequences  on  students  and  teachers,  and  the  degree 
There  were  adverse  consequences  for  students,  whose  faith  and  trust  in  a 

thereof: 
teacher  were  shaken  by  his  untoward  acts  of  touching  them  inappropriately. 

(B)  Proximity  in  time:  This  conduct  occurred  in  the  period  2012  to 

2013,  and  is  fairly  recent. 

(C)  Type  of  certificate  held  by  Respondent:  Not  fully  disclosed  by  the 

record,  but  it  must  be  inferred  that  he  holds  a  multiple  subject  credential,  allowing 
him  to  teach  kindergarten  through  middle  school  students. 

(D)  Likelihood  of  recurrence:  The  chance  of  recurrence  is  significant. 

Respondent  was  told  by  his  supervisor  in  2010  not  to  touch  the  students  for  any 
reason,  but  he  did  so  anyway,  on  more  than  one  occasion. 

 

(E)  Implication  of  constitutional  rights:  No  constitutional  rights,  of 
either  the  Respondent  or  other  teachers  are  implicated  if  Respondent  is  terminated. 

(F)  Extenuating  or  aggravating  circumstances:  In  aggravation, 

Respondent’s  actions  occurred  more  than  once,  despite  a  direct  instruction  from  his 
supervisor  not  to  touch  the  students. 

20. 

Under  all  the  circumstances,  Respondent’s  conduct  establishes  that  he 

is  unfit  to  teach  in  the  District,  within  the  meaning  of  the  Morrison  decision,  and  he 
should  be  terminated  as  a  teacher. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

1. 

The  Code  prescribes  the  procedures  to  be  followed  when  a  school 

district  wishes  to  dismiss,  suspend  or  otherwise  discipline  a  tenured  teacher.  (Wilmot 
v.  Commission  on  Professional  Competence  (1998)  64  Cal.App.4th  1130,  1132, 
(Wilmot),  Paramount  Unified  School  Dist.  v.  Teachers  Assn.  of Paramount  (1994)  26 
Cal.App.4th  1371,  1378  ;  see  §  44660  et  seq.)  Among  the  statutes  pertinent  to  this 
case  are  sections  44932,  which  sets  out  grounds  for  termination,  and  section  44944, 
which  sets  out  procedures  for  termination. 

2. 

Even  where  statutory  grounds  for  termination  are  established,  it  must 

also  be  established  that  such  conduct  renders  the  Respondent  unfit  to  teach. 
(Morrison  v.  State  Board  of Education  (1969)  1  Cal.3d  214,  229-230  (Morrison); 
Fontana  Unified  School  Dist.  v.  Burman  (1988)  45  Cal.3d  208;  Woodland  Joint 
Unified  School  District  v.  Commission  on  Professional  Competence  (1992)  2 
Cal.  App.4th  1429,  1444-1445;  see  Bourland  v.  Commission  on  Professional 
Competence  (1985)  174  Cal.App.3d  317,  321.) 

3. 

(A)  It  is  settled  that  the  trier  of  fact  may  “accept  part  of  the  testimony 

of  a  witness  and  reject  another  part  even  though  the  latter  contradicts  the  part 
accepted.”  (Stevens  v.  Parke  Davis  &  Co.  (1973)  9  Cal.3d  51,  67.)  The  trier  of  fact 
may  also  “reject  part  of  the  testimony  of  a  witness,  though  not  directly  contradicted, 
and  combine  the  accepted  portions  with  bits  of  testimony  or  inferences  from  the 
testimony  of  other  witnesses  thus  weaving  a  cloth  of  truth  out  of  selected  material.” 
(Id.,  at  67-68,  quoting  from  Neverov  v.  Caldwell  (1958)  161  Cal.App.2d  762,  767.) 
Further,  the  fact  finder  may  reject  the  testimony  of  a  witness,  even  an  expert,  although 
not  contradicted.  (Foreman  &  Clark  Corp.  v.  Fallon  (1971)  3  Cal.3d_  875,  890.) 
And,  the  testimony  of  “one  credible  witness  may  constitute  substantial  evidence,” 
including  a  single  expert  witness.  (Kearl  v.  Board  of Medical  Quality  Assurance 
(1986)  189  Cal.App.3d  1040,  at  1052.) 

(B)  The  rejection  of  testimony  does  not  create  evidence  contrary  to 
that  which  is  deemed  untrustworthy.  That  is,  disbelief  does  not  create  affirmative 

6    

evidence  to  the  contrary  of  that  which  is  discarded.  That  the  trier  of  fact  may 
disbelieve  the  testimony  of  a  witness  who  testifies  to  the  negative  of  an  issue  does  not 
of  itself  furnish  any  evidence  in  support  of  the  affirmative  of  that  issue,  and  does  not 
warrant  a  finding  in  the  affirmative  thereof  unless  there  is  other  evidence  in  the  case 
to  support  such  affirmative.  (Hutchinson  v.  Contractors’  State  License  Bd.  (1956) 
143  Cal.  App.2d  628,  632-633,  quoting  Marovich  v.  Central  California  Traction  Co. 
(1923)  191  Cal.295,  304.) 

(C)  Discrepancies  in  a  witness’s  testimony,  or  between  that  witness’s 
testimony  and  that  of  others,  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  the  testimony  should  be 
discredited.  (Wilson  v.  State  Personnel  Bd.  (1976)  58  Cal  App.3d  865,  879.) 

(D)  "On  the  cold  record  a  witness  may  be  clear,  concise,  direct, 

unimpeached,  uncontradicted  --  but  on  a  face  to  face  evaluation,  so  exude  insincerity 
as  to  render  his  credibility  factor  nil.  Another  witness  may  fumble,  bumble,  be  unsure, 
uncertain,  contradict  himself,  and  on  the  basis  of  a  written  transcript  be  hardly  worthy 
of  belief.  But  one  who  sees,  hears  and  observes  him  may  be  convinced  of  his  honesty, 
his  integrity,  his  reliability."  (Wilson  v.  State  Personnel  Board,  supra  at  877-878, 
quoting  Meiner  v.  Ford  Motor  Co.  (1971)  17  Cal.App.3d  127,  140.) 

Conclusions  Specific  to  This  Case 

4. 

Jurisdiction  was  established  to  proceed  in  this  matter,  pursuant  to 

section  44944,  and  Factual  Findings  1  and  2. 

5. 

Complainant  asserts  that  Respondent  should  be  terminated  for 

“egregious  conduct”  pursuant  to  section  44932,  subdivision  (a)(1),  which  states: 

(a)  A  permanent  employee  shall  not  be  dismissed  except  for  one 
or  more  of  the  following  causes: 

(1)  Immoral  conduct  including,  but  not  limited  to,  egregious 
misconduct.  For  the  purposes  of  this  chapter,  “egregious 
misconduct”  is  defined  exclusively  as  immoral  conduct  that  is 
the  basis  for  an  offense  described  in  Section  44010  or  44011  of 
this  code,  or  in  Sections  11165.2  to  11165.6,  inclusive,  of  the 
Penal  Code. 

6. 

(A)  As  shown  above,  two  Education  Code  sections  are  used  to  partially 

But,  they  do  so  by  themselves  referring  to  other

statutory  schemes.  Section  44011  refers  generally  to  controlled  substance  offenses, 
listing  various  sections  of  the  Health  and  Safety  Code  which  proscribe  the  use  of 
controlled  substances.  None  of  the  charges  in  this  case  refer  to  use  or  abuse  of 
controlled  substances,  so  section  44011  is  irrelevant. 

   

(B)  Section  44010  references  numerous  sections  of  the  Penal  Code  that 

tend  to  pertain  to  sex  offenses,  as  follows: 

“Sex  offense,”  as  used  in  Sections  44020,  44237,  44346,  44425, 
44436,  44836,  and  45123,  means  any  one  or  more  of  the 
offenses  listed  below: 

(a)  Any  offense  defined  in  Section  220,  261,  261.5,  262,  264.1, 
266,  266),  267,  285,  286,  288,  288a,  288.5,  289,  311.1,  311.2, 
311.3,  311.4,  311.10,  311.11,  313.1,  647b,  647.6,  or  former 
Section  647a,  subdivision  (a),  (b),  (c),  or  (d)  of  Section  243.4,  or 
subdivision  (a)  or  (d)  of  Section  647  of  the  Penal  Code. 

(b)  Any  offense  defined  in  former  subdivision  (5)  of  former 
Section  647  of  the  Penal  Code  repealed  by  Chapter  560  of  the 
Statutes  of  1961,  or  any  offense  defined  in  former  subdivision 
(2)  of  former  Section  311  of  the  Penal  Code  repealed  by  Chapter 
2147  of  the  Statutes  of  1961,  if  the  offense  defined  in  those 
sections  was  committed  prior  to  September  15,  1961,  to  the 
same  extent  that  an  offense  committed  prior  to  that  date  was  a 
sex  offense  for  the  purposes  of  this  section  prior  to  September 
15,  1961. 

(c)  Any  offense  defined  in  Section  314  of  the  Penal  Code 
committed  on  or  after  September  15,  1961. 

(d)  Any  offense  defined  in  former  subdivision  (1)  of  former 
Section  311  of  the  Penal  Code  repealed  by  Chapter  2147  of  the 
Statutes  of  1961  committed  on  or  after  September  7,  1955,  and 
prior  to  September  15,  1961. 

(e)  Any  offense  involving  lewd  and  lascivious  conduct  under 
Section  272  of  the  Penal  Code  committed  on  or  after  September 
15,  1961. 

(f)  Any  offense  involving  lewd  and  lascivious  conduct  under 
former  Section  702  of  the  Welfare  and  Institutions  Code 
repealed  by  Chapter  1616  of  the  Statutes  of  1961,  if  that  offense 
was  committed  prior  to  September  15,  1961,  to  the  same  extent 
that  an  offense  committed  prior  to  that  date  was  a  sex  offense 
for  the  purposes  of  this  section  prior  to  September  15,  1961. 

(g)  Any  offense  defined  in  Section  286  or  288a  of  the  Penal 
Code  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the  amendment  of  either 
section  enacted  at  the  1975-76  Regular  Session  of  the 

8    

Legislature  committed  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the 
amendment. 

(h)  Any  attempt  to  commit  any  of  the  offenses  specified  in  this 
section. 

(i)  Any  offense  committed  or  attempted  in  any  other  state  or 
against  the  laws  of  the  United  States  which,  if  committed  or 
attempted  in  this  state,  would  have  been  punishable  as  one  or 
more  of  the  offenses  specified  in  this  section. 

(j)  Any  conviction  for  an  offense  resulting  in  the  requirement  to 
register  as  a  sex  offender  pursuant  to  Section  290  of  the  Penal 
Code. 

(k)  Commitment  as  a  mentally  disordered  sex  offender  under 
former  Article  1  (commencing  with  Section  6300)  of  Chapter  2 
of  Part  2  of  the  Welfare  and  Institutions  Code,  as  repealed  by 
Chapter  928  of  the  Statutes  of  1981. 

7. 

An  examination  of  the  referenced  statutes  constitutes  a  lengthy 

excursion.  The  bulk  of  the  Penal  Code  statutes  cited  in  subdivision  (a)  of  section 
44010  do  not  come  close  to  being  relevant,  as  they  pertain  to  crimes  such  as  forcible 
rape,  sodomy,  or  even  incest.  The  referenced  Penal  Code  sections  311.1  through 
313.1  pertain  to  obscene  matter.  However,  as  discussed  below,  Penal  Code  section 
647.6,  which  pertains  to  molesting  or  annoying  a  child,  may  apply  to  this  case. 

8. 

Another  statute  used  in  section  44932,  subdivision  (a)(1),  to  define 

egregious  conduct  is  Penal  Code  section  11165.2,  which  defines  child  neglect.  It  does 
not  appear  relevant  to  this  case. 

9. 

Penal  Code  section  11165.3  states: 

As  used  in  this  article,  “the  willful  harming  or  injuring  of  a 
child  or  the  endangering  of  the  person  or  health  of  a  child,” 
means  a  situation  in  which  any  person  willfully  causes  or 
permits  any  child  to  suffer,  or  inflicts  thereon,  unjustifiable 
physical  pain  or  mental  suffering,  or  having  the  care  or  custody 
of  any  child,  willfully  causes  or  permits  the  person  or  health  of 
the  child  to  be  placed  in  a  situation  in  which  his  or  her  person 
or  health  is  endangered. 

10. 

~~  Penal  Code  section  11165.5,  also  used  in  section  44932,  subdivision 

(a)(1)  to  help  define  egregious  conduct,  provides,  in  pertinent  part  that: 

   

As  used  in  this  article,  the  term  “abuse  or  neglect  in  out-of- 
home  care”  includes  physical  injury  or  death  inflicted  upon  a 
child  by  another  person  by  other  than  accidental  means,  sexual 
abuse  as  defined  in  Section  11165.1,  neglect  as  defined  in 
Section  11165.2,  unlawful  corporal  punishment  or  injury  as 
defined  in  Section  11165.4,  or  the  willful  harming  or  injuring  of 
a  child  or  the  endangering  of  the  person  or  health  of  a  child,  as 
defined  in  Section  11165.3,  where  the  person  responsible  for  the 
child's  welfare  is  a...  employee  of  a  public  or  private  school. 

11. 

(A)  Penal  Code  section  11165.6  states: 

As  used  in  this  article,  the  term  “child  abuse  or  neglect” 
includes  physical  injury  or  death  inflicted  by  other  than 
accidental  means  upon  a  child  by  another  person,  sexual  abuse 
as  defined  in  Section  11165.1,  neglect  as  defined  in  Section 
11165.2,  the  willful  harming  or  injuring  of  a  child  or  the 
endangering  of  the  person  or  health  of  a  child,  as  defined  in 
Section  11165.3,  and  unlawful  corporal  punishment  or  injury  as 
defined  in  Section  11165.4.  “Child  abuse  or  neglect”  does  not 
include  a  mutual  affray  between  minors.  “Child  abuse  or 
neglect”  does  not  include  an  injury  caused  by  reasonable  and 
necessary  force  used  by  a  peace  officer  acting  within  the  course 
and  scope  of  his  or  her  employment  as  a  peace  officer. 
(Emphasis  added.) 

(B)  Penal  Code  section  11165.6,  by  referencing  Penal  Code  section 

11165.1,  brings  that  latter  statute  into  consideration  in  cases  of  this  type,  even  though 
it  was  not  directly  referenced  in  section  44932,  subdivision  (a)(1). 

(C)  Penal  Code  section  11165.1,  subdivision  (b)(4),  provides,  as 

follows: 

The  intentional  touching  of  the  genitals  or  intimate  parts, 
including  the  breasts,  genital  area,  groin,  inner  thighs,  and 
buttocks,  or  the  clothing  covering  them,  of  a  child,  or  of  the 
perpetrator  by  a  child,  for  purposes  of  sexual  arousal  or 
gratification,  except  that  it  does  not  include  acts  which  may 
reasonably  be  construed  to  be  normal  caretaker  responsibilities; 
interactions  with,  or  demonstrations  of  affection  for,  the  child; 
or  acts  performed  for  a  valid  medical  purpose. 

12. 

(A)  Penal  Code  section  647.6,  subdivision  (a)(1),  which  is  cited  in 

section  44010,  subdivision  (a),  states:  “Every  person  who  annoys  or  molests  a  child 
under  18  years  of  age  shall  be  punished  by  a  fine  not  exceeding  five  thousand  dollars 

10

($5,000),  by  imprisonment  in  a  county  jail  not  exceeding  one  year,  or  by  both  the  fine 
and  the  punishment.” 

(B)  In  the  case  of  In  re  D.G.  (2012)  208  Cal.App.4th  1562,  1571,  the 

Court  of  Appeal  stated,  regarding  the  meaning  of  Penal  Code  section  647.6, 
subdivision  (a)(1),  that: 

The  words  “annoy”  and  “molest”  are  synonymous  and  “refer  to 
conduct  designed  ‘to  disturb  or  irritate,  espfecially]  by 
continued  or  repeated  acts’  or  ‘to  offend’  [citation];  and  as  used 
in  this  statute,  they  ordinarily  relate  to  ‘offenses  against 
children,  [with]  a  connotation  of  abnormal  sexual  motivation  on 
the  part  of  the  offender.’  [Citation.]  Ordinarily,  the  annoyance 
or  molestation  which  is  forbidden  is  ‘not  concerned  with  the 
state  of  mind  of  the  child’  but  it  is  ‘the  objectionable  acts  of  the 
defendant  which  constitute  the  offense,’  and  if  his  conduct  is  ‘so 
lewd  or  obscene  that  the  normal  person  would  unhesitatingly  be 
irritated  by  it,  such  conduct  would  “annoy  or  molest”  within  the 
purview  of”  the  statute.  [Citation.]”  (People  v.  Carskaddon 
(1957)  49  Cal.2d  423,  426,  318  P.2d  4.)  The  primary  purpose  of 
section  647.6  “is  the  ‘protection  of  children  from  interference  by 
sexual  offenders....’  [Citations.]”  (fd.  at  p.  425,  318  P.2d  4.) 
“The  deciding  factor  for  purposes  of  a  Penal  Code  647.6  charge 
is  that  the  defendant  has  engaged  in  offensive  or  annoying 
sexually  motivated  conduct  which  invades  a  child’s  privacy  and 
security,  conduct  which  the  government  has  a  substantial 
interest  in  preventing...”  (People  v.  Kongs  (1994)  30 
Cal.App.4th  1741,  1752,  37  Cal.  Rptr.2d  327.)  “[T]here  can  be 
no  normal  sexual  interest  in  any  child  and  it  is  the  sexual 
interest  in  the  child  that  is  the  focus  of  the  statute’s  intent.” 
(People  v.  Shaw  (2009)  177  Cal.App.4th  92,  103,  99 
Cal.  Rptr.3d  112,  italics  omitted.) 

(C)  The  Court  of  Appeal  went  on  to  state  that  an  actual  touching  of  the  child 

is  not  necessary  to  constitute  a  violation  of  Penal  Code  section  647.6,  subdivision 
(a)(1);  words  alone  can  suffice.  (in  re  D.G.,  supra,  204  Cal.App.4th  at  1572.) 

13. 

Based  on  Factual  Findings  5-7,  it  must  be  concluded  that  Respondent’s 

conduct  amounted  to  the  annoyance  or  molestation  of  a  child  under  the  age  of  18 
years,  and  violated  Penal  Code  section  647.6,  subdivision  (a)(1).  Therefore, 
Respondent  has  committed  egregious  (mis)conduct  within  the  meaning  of  sections 
44932,  subdivision  (a)(1),  and  44010,  subdivision  (a).° 

* 

To  be  sure,  this  Conclusion,  like  the  underlying  findings,  is  based  on  a 

preponderance  of  the  evidence,  the  standard  applying  to  proceedings  of  this  type.  It  is 

11 

   

14. 

Based  on  Factual  Finding  8,  it  is  concluded  that  Respondent’s  act  of 
grabbing  student Ma.  and  shaking  him,  violated  Penal  Code  section  11165.5, 
quoted  in  Legal  Conclusion  10,  as  constituting  unlawful  corporal  injury  of  a  student, 
by  a  school  employee  responsible  for  the  child’s  well  being.  Therefore,  Respondent 
has  committed  egregious  conduct  within  the  meaning  of  section  44932,  subdivision 
(a)(1). 

15. 

Based  on  Legal  Conclusions  13  and  14,  and  their  factual  and  legal 

predicates,  cause  exists  to  terminate  Respondent  for  egregious  conduct  pursuant  to 
sections  44932,  subdivision  (a)(1),  and  44939, 

16. 

Applying  the  Morrison  factors,  it  must  be  concluded  that  Respondent's 

conduct  renders  him  unfit  to  teach  in  the  District,  based  on  Factual  Findings  18 
through  20. 

17. 

Based  on  all  the  foregoing,  Respondent  should  be  terminated  as  a 

certificated  employee  of  the  District. 

ORDER 

Respondent  Carlos  Menendez  shall  be  terminated  as  a  certificated  employee  of
