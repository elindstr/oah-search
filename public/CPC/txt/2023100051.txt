STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
In the Matter of the Dismissal of: 
JEFFREY BRANDOW, 
A Permanent Certificated Employee, 
Respondent. 
OAH No. 2023100051 
DECISION 
This matter was heard by videoconference on June 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, and 11, 2024, 
before the Commission on Professional Competence for the San Luis Coastal Unified 
School District (Commission). The Commission consisted of Christopher Bourke, 
Matthew Hutsell, and Julie Cabos Owen, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) with the Office 
of Administrative Hearings (OAH), State of California. The San Luis Coastal Unified 
School District (District) was represented by Daniel M. McElhinney and Aislinn Roberts, 
Attorneys at Law, with Lozano Smith. Jeffrey Brandow (Respondent) appeared and was 
represented by David P. Myers and Justin M. Crane, Attorneys at Law with The Myers 
Law Group, APC. 2 PRE-TRIAL MOTIONS
Prior to presentation of the evidence, Respondent made several pre-trial 
motions which were addressed as follows: 
Respondent made a “Motion in Limine No. 1 to Exclude Untimely Allegations” 
(Motion in Limine #1), seeking to exclude all evidence regarding Jane Doe 6 as barred 
by the four-year statute. Motion in Limine #1 was heard by videoconference on 
February 1, 2024. For the reasons stated in the February 5, 2024 Ruling on 
Respondent’s Motion in Limine #1, and as summarized in the Legal Conclusions, 
below, the ALJ granted Respondent’s Motion in Limine #1 and excluded all evidence 
regarding Jane Doe 6. 
Respondent made Motion in Limine #2 and Motion in Limine #3 to exclude 
evidence pertaining to Jane Does 5 and 4, respectively, based on unreasonable delay 
in providing derogatory information as set forth in Education Code section 44031. 
Respondent also made Motion in Limine #4 to exclude evidence regarding 
unprofessional conduct as set forth in Education Code section 44938. Motions in 
Limine #2, #3, and #4 were heard on June 3, 2024. For the reasons stated on the 
record and as set forth in the Legal Conclusions, below, the ALJ denied Motions in 
Limine #2, #3, and #4. 
AMENDMENT TO STATEMENT OF CHARGES
During the hearing, the First Amended Statement of Charges was amended by 
interlineation as follows: at paragraph 93 (Exhibit 1, p. A15, line 10), the date “2021”
was changed to “2022.”3 PROTECTIVE ORDER ISSUED
At the hearing, the Commission was provided with Exhibits 8 and 58 which 
contain confidential information protected from disclosure to the public. Redaction of 
the documents to obscure this confidential information was not practicable and would 
not have provided adequate privacy protection. To prevent the disclosure of 
confidential information, the ALJ issued a June 11, 2024 Protective Order placing 
Exhibits 8 and 58 under seal. These exhibits shall remain under seal and shall not be 
opened, except by order of OAH or by a reviewing court. A reviewing court, parties to 
this matter, their attorneys, or a government agency decision maker or designee under 
Government Code section 11517 may review the documents subject to this order 
provided that such documents are protected from release to the public.
PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE AND BRIEFING
Testimony and documentary evidence was received. The record was left open 
for the parties to submit closing and reply briefs. The District submitted its Closing 
Brief and its Reply, which were marked and lodged as Exhibits 60 and 61, respectively.
Respondent submitted his Closing Brief and his Reply, which were marked and lodged 
as Exhibits BR-1 and BR-2, respectively. The matter was submitted for decision on July 
26, 2024.
The Commission on Professional Competence considered the matter in 
executive session. After due consideration of the entire record herein, the Commission 
makes the following factual findings, legal conclusions, and order.4 FACTUAL FINDINGS
Parties and Procedural Background 
1. Respondent has been employed by the District since the 2012-2013 
school year. 
2. Respondent is a permanent certificated employee of the District. He is 
currently assigned to teach social studies for grades 9 through 12 at San Luis Obispo 
High School (SLOHS). 
3. The students’ age in Respondent's classes range from 14 to 18 years old.
4. Respondent has worked as a classroom teacher, coach, and athletic 
director (AD) at SLOHS. He also worked as a cooperating teacher during the 2021-
2022 school year supervising a student teacher in his classroom. 
5. Respondent also works at The Pumpkin Patch SLO, a local business his 
family owns. Respondent and his wife employed several SLOHS students at the 
Pumpkin Patch. 
6. Respondent has one prior instance of unprofessional conduct in 2019. In 
January 2019, the District issued Respondent a written Conference Summary following 
his meeting with then Director of Human Resources, Christin Newlon. The Conference 
Summary reminded Respondent to refrain from engaging in unprofessional conduct 
and provided Respondent an excerpt of Board Policy 4119.21, which sets forth 
employees’ Code of Conduct. The Conference Summary also “directed [Respondent] to 
do the following[:] 1. Behave in a professional manner in all of your interactions with 5 District personnel. 2. Review and follow all District Board Policies including 4119.21.” 
(Exhibit 34, p. A373.) 
7. On October 17, 2022, the District received an anonymous report alleging 
Respondent engaged in inappropriate interactions with Jane Doe 1. (The alleged 
victims are identified herein as numbered Jane Does to protect their privacy.) In 
October 2022, SLOHS Principal Rollin Dickenson and Assistant Principal Desiree 
Dellinger met with Jane Doe 1. Over the ensuing weeks, Dickenson also met with 
several other students, Respondent and his union representative, and Dan Block, 
District Director of Human Resources since July 2021. 
8. Dickenson and Block testified about their involvement in the early stages 
of the District’s investigation. Their testimony was straightforward, and they presented 
as credible witnesses. 
9. During Dickenson’s October 2022 meeting with Jane Doe 1, she reported 
her text messages and verbal communications with Respondent. However, as set forth 
more fully below, she did not reveal the full extent of the texts between them. During 
Dickenson’s meetings, Jane Doe 1 and other students reported some, but not all, of 
the comments Respondent made in his classroom about how females were dressed. 
The District also determined Respondent had received at least one text message from 
Jane Doe 3. 
10. Dickenson and Block recalled that, during Respondent’s interview with 
the District, he confirmed there were text messages between Jane Doe 1 and himself, 
but he insisted the texts were Pumpkin Patch work-related and not inappropriate. The 
District asked Respondent to turn over all texts between Jane Doe 1 and himself, but 
Respondent said he could not because he routinely deletes all texts. 6 11. After the October 2022 meeting, Jane Doe 1 and her family refused to 
cooperate with the District’s investigation. They did not provide a reason for their 
reticence. 
12. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to obtain Jane Doe 1’s 
participation in the investigation, the District decided to conclude its investigation. 
13. On December 29, 2022, pursuant to Education Code section 44938, the 
District issued Respondent a 45-day Notice alleging unprofessional conduct by 
sending and receipt of inappropriate texts with Jane Doe 1 and another unidentified 
female student (allegedly Jane Doe 3, but later proven to be another student). 
14. After the 45-day notice was issued, the District discovered additional 
information. In about February or early March 2023, Jane Doe 1’s family informed 
Block that their attorney was trying to contact him. In early March 2023, Block and 
District counsel, Dan McElhinney, met with Jane Doe 1, her attorney, and her parents. 
At that meeting, Jane Doe 1 provided a much more detailed account of the text 
messages between Respondent and herself, their interactions at The Pumpkin Patch, 
and Respondent’s directing her to delete the text messages. At that meeting, the 
District first viewed a video recording of students reading one of the October 2022 
text strings between Jane Doe 1 and Respondent. Neither Jane Doe 1 nor any other 
person had provided this information to the District during its October 2022 
investigatory meetings. 
15. After the March 2023 meeting, the District declined to seek another 
meeting with Respondent to discuss Jane Doe 1’s additional information. The District 
doubted Respondent would be forthcoming with any further information because he 
previously denied wrongdoing and said he deleted all text messages. 7 16. After the March 2023 meeting, the District placed Respondent on paid 
administrative leave effective March 9, 2023.
17. After March 9, 2023, the District continued to discover additional 
allegations of misconduct against Respondent regarding his interactions with female 
SLOHS volunteers (Jane Does 4 and 5). The information was gleaned through news 
articles reported in the local press, and District counsel were tasked with following up 
on any new information.
18. On August 15, 2023, in his official capacity as Director of Human 
Resources for the District, Block filed the Statement of Charges (SOC) against 
Respondent. On August 17, 2023, the District served Respondent with a Notice of 
Intent to Dismiss (dated August 16, 2023) and the SOC. On March 4, 2024, in his 
official capacity, Block filed the First Amended Notice of Intent to Dismiss and 
Statement of Charges (ASOC), and these documents were thereafter served on 
Respondent. 
19. Block testified credibly about the policies enacted by the District’s 
Governing Board (Board) and the steps the District took prior to and after the issuance 
of the 45-day notice, the SOC, and the ASOC. Block signed the SOC on information 
and belief in his official capacity in consultation with the team investigating 
Respondent’s alleged misconduct. The failure of the District to prove some of the 
alleged charges does not diminish Block’s credibility in relating the procedural events 
and authenticating the policies of the Board. Additionally, while Block stated his 
opinions about Respondent violating Board policies, Block’s opinions are not binding 
on the Commission which must independently determine whether Respondent 
violated policies based on the proven facts at hearing. 8 Board Policies and Training
20. On July 12, 2012, Respondent signed a document entitled “New 
Employee Orientation/Mandated Notifications” which contained the following 
acknowledgement: 
By signing below I acknowledge that I have received a copy 
of the following [District] documents and understand that 
they outline my privileges, obligations, and responsibilities 
as an employee of the District. 
I further understand that I am accountable for the contents 
of the [District] documents and that it is my responsibility to 
familiarize myself with all information in these documents. I 
agree to comply with all responsibilities of employment. 
(Exhibit 42, p. A451.) 
21. Several District documents were listed in the “New Employee 
Orientation/Mandated Notifications,” including “Sexual Harassment Policy.” (Exhibit 42, 
p. A451.) Consequently, Respondent acknowledged receipt of the Sexual Harassment 
Policy and his responsibility to familiarize himself with that policy. 
22. District employees are routinely notified of Board policies including those 
set forth below. 
23. Board Policy BP4119.21 (Certificated) (adopted: April 15, 2003; Revised: 
July 19, 2018) provides, in pertinent part: 
Code of Conduct 9 The Board of Education expects district employees to 
maintain the highest ethical standards, behave 
professionally, to follow district policies and regulations, 
and to abide by state and federal laws and exercise good 
judgment when interacting with students and other 
members of the school community. Employee shall engage 
in conduct that enhances the integrity of the district, 
advances the goals of the district's educational programs, 
and contributes to a positive school climate. [¶] . . . [¶]
Inappropriate Conduct 
Inappropriate employee conduct includes, but is not limited 
to: [¶] . . . [¶] 
2. Engaging in harassing or discriminatory behavior towards 
students, parents/guardians, staff, or community members, 
or failing or refusing to intervene when an act of 
discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying against 
a student is observed. 
(cf. 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and 
Activities) (cf. 4119.11/4219.11/4319.11 - Sexual 
Harassment) (cf. 5131.2 - Bullying) (cf. 5145.3 - 
Nondiscrimination/Harassment) (cf. 5145.7 - Sexual

students, parents/guardians, staff, or community members. 
[¶] . . . [¶] 
9. Being dishonest with students, parents/guardians, staff, 
or members of the public, including, but not limited to, 
falsifying information in employment records or other 
school records. 
(Exhibit 39.) 
24. Board Policy BP4119.24/4219.24/4319.24 (adopted: October 20, 2020)
provides, in pertinent part:
Maintaining Appropriate Adult-Student Interactions 
The Governing Board desires to provide a positive school 
environment that protects the safety and well-being of 
district students. The Board expects all adults with whom 
students may interact at school or in school-related 
activities, including employees, independent contractors, 
and volunteers, to maintain the highest professional and 
ethical standards in their interactions with students both 
within and outside the educational setting. Such adults shall 
not engage in unlawful or inappropriate interactions with 
students and shall avoid boundary-blurring behaviors that 
undermine trust in the adult-student relationship and lead 
to the appearance of impropriety. (cf. 
4119.21/4219.21/4319.21 - Professional Standards)11 Employees are prohibited from entering into or attempting 
to form a romantic or sexual relationship with any student 
or engaging in sexual harassment of a student, including 
sexual advances, flirtations, requests for sexual favors, 
inappropriate comments about a student's body or 
appearance, or other verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a 
sexual nature. (cf. 5145.7 - Sexual Harassment) 
Adults shall not intrude on a student's physical or emotional 
boundaries unless necessary in an emergency or to serve a 
legitimate purpose related to instruction, counseling, 
student health, or student or staff safety. [¶] . . [¶] 
Inappropriate Conduct 
Employees shall remain vigilant of their position of 
authority and not abuse it when relating with students. 
Examples of employee conduct that can undermine 
professional adult-student interactions or create the 
appearance of impropriety include, but are not limited to: 
1. Initiating inappropriate physical contact 
2. Being alone with a student outside of the view of others 
3. Visiting a student's home or inviting a student to visit the 
employee's home without parent/guardian consent 
4. Maintaining personal contact with a student that has no 
legitimate educational purpose, by phone, letter, electronic 12 communications, or other means, without including the 
student's parent/guardian or the principal When 
communicating electronically with students, employees 
shall use district equipment or technological resources 
when available. Employees shall not communicate with 
students through any medium that is designed to eliminate 
records of the communications. The Superintendent or 
designee may monitor employee usage of district 
technology at any time without advance notice or consent. 
(cf. 4040 - Employee Use of Technology)
(Exhibit 38.)
25. Board Policy BP 4030 (adopted: April 15, 2003; Revised: August 21, 2012, 
September 6, 2016, August 21, 2018, July 18, 2019, August 3, 2021, September 20, 
2022, November 15, 2022, and May 2, 2023) provides, in pertinent part: 
Nondiscrimination in Employment 
The Governing Board is determined to provide a safe and 
positive environment where all district employees, are 
assured of full and equal employment access and 
opportunities, protection from harassment and intimidation, 
and freedom from any fear of reprisal or retribution for 
asserting their employment rights in accordance with law. 
This policy shall apply to employees including interns, 
volunteers, job applicants and persons who contracted with 
the district to provide services, as applicable. 13 No district employee shall be discriminated against or 
harassed by any coworker, supervisor, manager, or other 
person with whom an employee comes in contact in the 
course of employment. No district employee or job 
applicant shall be discriminated against or harassed on the 
basis of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, 
protective hairstyle, ancestry, religious creed, age, 
immigration status, marital status, pregnancy, reproductive 
health decision-making, physical or mental disability, 
medical condition, military and veteran status, gender, sex, 
sexual orientation, genetic information, gender expression, 
gender identity or association with a person or group with 
one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics (cf. 
1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures) [¶] . . . [¶] 
Discrimination in employment based on the characteristics 
listed above is prohibited in all areas of employment and in 
all employment-related practices including the following: [¶] 
. . . [¶] 
3. Unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical, or visual, 
that is so severe or pervasive as to adversely affect an 
employee's employment opportunities, or that has the 
purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the 
individual's work performance, or creating an intimidating, 
hostile, or offensive work environment (cf. 
4119.11/4219.11/4319.11 - Sexual Harassment) 14 (Exhibit 40.)
26. Leslie O’Connor, former SLOHS principal (2011-2021) and current 
Secondary Director of Learning and Achievement (since 2021), testified credibly 
regarding the training provided to certificated staff. He confirmed that, when he was 
principal, teachers at SLOHS were required to complete sexual harassment prevention 
training each school year. He also confirmed that, in Fall 2022, all coaches, including 
Respondent, attended a Safe Sports Policy training session. The Safe Sports Policy 
training includes discussions of Board policies (e.g., the Board policy regarding 
appropriate student communications) and addresses expectations of how staff should 
conduct themselves with student athletes and communicate with families. 
27. Respondent testified at the administrative hearing in an evasive and 
equivocal manner. He had to be admonished several times to focus on answering the 
questions asked. His responses to questions were vague, rambling, and incomplete, 
and his testimony in general appeared to be an attempt at misdirection. Respondent 
sought to paint himself in the most favorable light and to place blame on others. 
Additionally, many of Respondent’s assertions were contradicted by the evidence (e.g., 
he insisted he did not use emojis, but his text messages contained numerous emojis). 
Consequently, the entirety of Respondent’s testimony lacked credibility, and the 
Commission did not rely on Respondent’s testimony unless corroborated by other 
credible evidence. 
28. Specifically, regarding District policies and training, Respondent testified 
that he did not have any training on sexual harassment and that he is not familiar with 
Board polices. However, Respondent knew or should have known what proper 
behaviors were expected of him through his 2012 orientation materials which included 
a sexual harassment prevention handout, through annual sexual harassment training, 15 through distribution of Board policies, and eventually through the Safe Sports Policy
training that included such information. Consequently, Respondent’s assertion that he 
was unaware he should not engage in sexual harassment and other misconduct was 
not credible.
Respondent’s Misconduct
29. The ASOC alleges that Respondent engaged in misconduct with Jane 
Does 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. The alleged misconduct will be addressed below in 
chronological order of occurrence, rather than in the order discovered by the District 
(as set forth in the ASOC). 
RESPONDENT ’S MISCONDUCT WITH JANE DOE 5 
30. The facts regarding Jane Doe 5 were established by the credible 
testimony of Jane Doe 5 and Marci Beddall.
31. Jane Doe 5 testified in a forthright manner. She responded to questions 
with straightforward answers and admitted when she did not know an answer. Her 
testimony was corroborated by other evidence, and she presented as a credible 
witness.
32. Beddall served as the SLOHS Assistant AD when Respondent was AD. 
During the 2020-2021 school year, Beddall was appointed SLOHS AD, a position which 
she currently holds.
33. Beddall testified at the administrative hearing in a straightforward 
manner. She presented as a credible witness.16 34. Beddall recalled interacting with Respondent and seeing him interact 
with other women, both on and off the SLOHS campus. She characterized Respondent 
as flirtatious. 
35. During the 2019-2020 school year, while Respondent was AD, he directly 
supervised Jane Doe 5 who served as the walk-on coach for the SLOHS cheer and 
stunt teams. Jane Doe 5 was the married mother of SLOHS students. 
36. On numerous occasions during the 2019-2020 school year, Respondent 
sent Jane Doe 5 text messages asking her to go out for drinks with him, sometimes 
with a group and sometimes alone. Once he sent her a picture of just his legs and a 
beer, with a text that stated, “Great day for a beer. You should come over.” (Testimony 
of Jane Doe 5.) Jane Doe 5 declined Respondent’s invitations because she did not 
think spouses should have outside relationships with the opposite gender. Jane Doe 5 
described Respondent as “very flirty,” and she felt that Respondent “just liked the 
chase and was maybe trying to have an affair.” 
37. On one occasion, at about 11:00 p.m., Respondent texted Jane Doe 5 
while she was at home and Respondent was at a bar. Respondent asked Jane Doe 5 to 
pick him up from the bar. Respondent informed Jane Doe 5 that he had been out 
drinking with friends for his birthday, and his friends left him at the bar. Jane Doe 5 
told Respondent to call his wife or order an Uber pick-up, but Respondent said he did 
not have an Uber account. Jane Doe 5 demanded Respondent stop communicating 
with her in such ways. She told him she would tell her husband and would go to the 
District to complain. 
38. Respondent apologized, and he stopped texting her. 17 39. Respondent’s testimony about his interactions with Jane Doe 5 was 
vague. He recalled he “sometimes said [let’s] grab beer with other coaches,” but when 
Jane Doe 5 said, “my husband does not like it,” he apologized profusely and never 
reached out to her again about anything non-work related. Respondent did not rebut
Jane Doe’s credible testimony that he texted her at 11:00 p.m. and asked her to pick 
him up from a bar. 
40. The ASOC, paragraphs 65 through 70, alleges Respondent made negative 
statements about Jane Doe 5 to incoming AD Beddall, and his comments resulted in 
Jane Doe 5’s removal from her coaching position. The allegations in paragraphs 65 
through 70 of the ASOC were not proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Rather, 
Beddall credibly testified that Jane Doe 5 was removed as a coach because the District 
wanted on-site (not walk-on) coaches and sought to employ a coach who had more 
stunt experience than Jane Doe 5, since stunt had become a CIF sport. Beddall also 
noted complaints by parents and students, and Jane Doe 5 acknowledged she was “a 
tough coach.” Beddall’s testimony was corroborated by the credible testimony of 
former SLOHS Principal Leslie O’Connor. Additionally, Jane Doe 5 admitted she had 
another employment opportunity at the time her SLOHS coaching contract was 
discontinued in 2021. 
41. The ASOC, paragraph 71, alleges, “Jane Doe 5 experienced significant 
negative impacts as a result of Respondent's behavior including fear of other people 
finding out about his behavior.” This allegation was not proven by the preponderance 
of the evidence. The evidence established no such negative impacts to Jane Doe 5.
42. Jane Doe 5’s oral complaint about Respondent’s inappropriate texting 
during the 2019-2020 school year was unknown to the District until Spring of 2021, 
when Jane Doe 5 had a meeting with Beddall about discontinuing her coaching 18 contract. Jane Doe 5 never provided the District with copies of Respondent’s texts. In 
the Spring of 2021, Beddall forwarded Jane Doe 5’s complaint about Respondent’s 
inappropriate texts to the District’s Human Resources department. However, the 
complaint was not placed in Respondent’s personnel file, and Respondent was not 
questioned about it. Jane Doe 5’s complaint was not investigated by the District until 
after the 45-day notice had been issued in December 2022, and after news articles 
appeared in the local press describing unnamed coaches’ complaints about 
Respondent. Jane Doe 5 was contacted by the local press after the articles appeared, 
and she was later contacted by District counsel. Thereafter, the District filed the 
original SOC in August 2023. 
RESPONDENT ’S MISCONDUCT WITH JANE DOE 4 
43. The facts regarding Jane Doe 4 were established by the credible 
testimony of Jane Doe 4 and Beddall. 
44. Jane Doe 4 testified in a very straightforward manner. She had no 
personal agenda against Respondent, and she provided candid responses to 
questions. Her recollection of events was corroborated by other evidence, and she 
presented as a credible witness.
45. Jane Doe 4 graduated from SLOHS in 2016. During the 2019-2020 school 
year when she was approximately 21 years old, Jane Doe 4 served as a volunteer 
assistant athletic trainer at SLOHS. 
46. During the 2019-2020 school year, Respondent asked Jane Doe 4 if she 
had a boyfriend, and when she said “no,” he asked whether she was sexually active. He 
repeatedly texted her between 8:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m., asking her to meet up for 
drinks after work hours or asking her to pick him up from a bar to give him a ride 19 home. Jane Doe 4 did not go out with Respondent alone. A couple times, Respondent 
suggested they meet off campus after work hours for a drink to discuss a possible paid 
contract for Jane Doe 4. Such meetings never took place. Jane Doe 4 felt Respondent’s 
comments and conversations were “a little inappropriate [given] the power dynamic,” 
with her “being a volunteer and him being AD.” 
47. The ASOC, paragraph 60 alleges, in part, “Respondent told Jane Doe 4 
that if she would go out with him, he could make sure she was able to be paid by 
SLOHS.” This allegation was not proven by a preponderance of the evidence. 
48. Jane Doe 4 did not file any complaint against Respondent because she 
felt it would lessen her opportunity to work at SLOHS in the future. 
49. Jane Doe 4 discontinued her volunteer position at the end of the 2019-
2020 school year. 
50. In early March 2021, Jane Doe 4 requested a meeting with Beddall to 
discuss a possible paid position as an assistant athletic trainer. She and Beddall met on 
March 5, 2021. During that meeting, Beddall told Jane Doe 4 that no paid position was 
available for her. Beddall brought up the issue of Respondent’s text messages, and 
Jane Doe 4 was surprised Beddall was aware of Respondent’s texts prior to their March 
5, 2021 meeting. Jane Doe 4 confirmed Respondent’s inappropriate behavior and texts 
with her during the 2019-2020 school year. 
51. In emails from March 5 through 8, 2021, Beddall and then SLOHS 
Principal O’Connor sought to have a joint meeting with Jane Doe 4 to discuss 
Respondent’s inappropriate behavior and texts. On March 6, 2021, Jane Doe 4 sent an 
email to O’Connor and Beddall stating, “I appreciate the effort to reach out and meet 
with me. Unless this is an employment opportunity, I respectfully decline meeting on 20 Monday morning.” (Exhibit J.) In emails through March 8, 2021, Jane Doe 4 continued 
to decline meeting with them. 
52. The specific circumstances of Respondent’s inappropriate conduct with 
Jane Doe 4 during the 2019-2020 school year were unknown to the District until March 
5, 2021, when Jane Doe 4 confirmed the texting and inappropriate conduct during her 
meeting with Beddall. Jane Doe 4 never provided the District with copies of 
Respondent’s texts. In March 2021, Beddall created a Google document about 
Respondent’s inappropriate conduct which she shared with then Principal O’Connor 
and forwarded to the District’s Human Resources Department. However, no 
documentation of Respondent’s inappropriate behavior with Jane Doe 4 was placed in 
Respondent’s personnel file, and Respondent was not questioned about his conduct. 
The District did not follow up on the Google document and did not investigate 
Respondent’s inappropriate behavior with Jane Doe 4 until after issuance of the 45-
day notice in December 2022, and after news articles appeared in the local press 
reporting facts similar to Respondent’s conduct with Jane Doe 4. Jane Doe 4 did not 
initiate contact with the press. She was contacted by local press after the articles 
appeared. She was later contacted by District counsel around June 2023. Thereafter, 
the District filed the original SOC in August 2023. The Google document was later 
forwarded to District counsel. 
RESPONDENT ’S MISCONDUCT WITH JANE DOE 7 
53. The facts regarding Jane Doe 7 were established by the credible 
testimony of Jane Doe 7 and her daughter, Jane Doe 2, and by corroborating evidence. 
54. Jane Doe 7 testified at the hearing. Her testimony was direct and candid. 
She presented as a credible witness. 21 55. Jane Doe 2 is a graduate of SLOHS. During the 2021-2022 school year, 
she was a junior in Respondent’s class. 
56. In about December 2021, Respondent asked Jane Doe 2 to come to his 
desk where he had Jane Doe 7’s Instagram account displayed. (The evidence did not 
establish the device on which Respondent had the account displayed.) Jane Doe 7 
posts Instagram pictures of her travels and herself wearing bikinis. Jane Doe 2 yelled, 
“That’s my mom’s Instagram!” Respondent replied, “Shhh!” Respondent asked Jane 
Doe 2 to give him Jane Doe 7’s phone number. He said he wanted to meet Jane Doe 7 
to talk about bartending at the hotel where Jane Doe 7 worked as a bartender. Jane 
Doe 2 provided Jane Doe 7’s phone number to Respondent. 
57. On December 10, 2021, Respondent texted Jane Doe 7, “[T]his is Jeff 
Brandow, [Jane Doe 2’s] teacher. Hoping to stop by for a drink and say hello at some 
point this weekend.” (Exhibit 10, p. A312.) Jane Doe 7 told him to come by and 
informed him she worked until 10:00 p.m. 
58. On December 10, 2021, Respondent went to Jane Doe 7’s place of 
employment and had a conversation with her. After she finished work, they began 
having a sexual relationship.
59. During the 2021-2022 school year, the bell schedule for SLOHS on 
Mondays was as follows: Period 1 - 9:30 a.m. to 10:24 a.m.; Period 2 - 10:31 a.m. to 
11:25 a.m.; Period 3 - 11:32 a.m. to 12:33 p.m.; Period 4 - 1:15 p.m. to 2:09 p.m.; and 
Period 5 - 2:16 p.m. to 3:10 p.m. The bell schedule for SLOHS on Tuesdays through 
Fridays was as follows: Period 1 - 8:00 a.m. to 9:10 a.m.; Period 2 - 9:24 a.m. to 10:34 
a.m.; Period 3 - 10:41 a.m. to 12:01 p.m.; Period 4 - 12:43 p.m. to 1:53 p.m.; and Period 
5 - 2:00 p.m. to 3:10 p.m. 22 60. During the second trimester (November through March) of the 2021-
2022 school year, Respondent’s teaching assignment was U.S. History and Geography 
during Periods 1, 3, 4, and 5. Respondent’s preparation period was Period 2 (Mondays 
10:31 a.m. to 11:25 a.m.; Tuesdays-Fridays 9:24 a.m. to 10:34 a.m.) During Periods 1, 3, 
4, and 5, Respondent was required to be in his classroom. 
61. During Periods 3 and 5 of the second trimester of the 2021-2022 school 
year, Respondent also had a student teacher in his classroom working toward 
obtaining a credential. Respondent was the cooperating teacher, and he was expected 
to supervise the student teacher and provide feedback. Although a student teacher is 
gradually given more teaching responsibilities, SLOHS Principal Dickenson and former 
SLOHS Principal O’Connor credibly testified that the cooperating teacher is expected 
to remain in the classroom working with and supervising the student teacher during 
class time. 
62. According to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the 
District and certificated staff, secondary teachers are expected to be on site for “7 hrs. 
and 40 min., including half-hour lunch.” (Exhibit 32, p. A365.) Dickenson, O’Connor, 
and Block all credibly testified that SLOHS teachers are on paid status during their 
preparation periods and are expected to use their preparation periods for class 
preparation. The CBA also provides: 
Secondary Preparation Period 
Each regular, full-time middle and high school classroom 
teacher shall be afforded preparation periods equivalent to 
a class, consistent in length with the master schedule cycle 
of classes for the site. Preparation periods shall be used for 23 professional, job related work including preparation for 
classes, preparation of teaching materials, and conferences 
with administrators, staff, counselors, students, and parents. 
During the scheduled preparation period, unit members 
shall not normally be expected to perform pupil supervision 
or classroom teaching duties. However, they may be 
required to do so in emergencies, or where another unit 
member is absent and no substitute is readily available to 
cover the assignment or when needed to cover for a 
teacher who is engaged in assigned athletic or other extra-
curricular activities[.]
(Exhibit 32, p. A368.)
63. Teachers occasionally left the SLOHS campus during their preparation 
periods for various reasons, including getting supplies for class or getting coffee. They 
also occasionally left for banking, veterinarian appointments, and other personal 
appointments. However, O’Connor credibly testified that teachers were expected to 
inform the assistant principal or someone in the District’s main office when they left 
campus in order to ensure the District could account for all staff during an emergency.
64. From December 2021 through April 2022, Respondent left the SLOHS 
campus regularly during work hours to meet Jane Doe 7 at her apartment to have sex. 
He did not inform anyone at the main office about his absences from campus. 
65. On December 11, 2021, Respondent and Jane Doe 7 began texting on a 
near daily basis to coordinate when they would meet each other during Respondent’s 
workday. The text messages indicated Respondent was leaving campus during his 24 Period 2 preparation period and during Period 3 class time when he should have been 
supervising his student teacher. Examples of text messages Respondent sent to Jane 
Doe 7 are set forth below. (Respondent and Jane Doe 7 exchanged thousands of text 
messages during the months of their sexual relationship. However, only a few 
exemplars were provided as evidence at hearing.) 
66. On December 13, 2021, Respondent texted Jane Doe 7 at 2:49 p.m., “I 
literally work 2-3 hours a day. Lots of free time/time off.” (Exhibit 11.) At 2:54 p.m., in 
response to Jane Doe 7’s invitation to come by between 6:00-11:00 p.m., Respondent 
texted, “Well I really really wanna fuck you senseless, so I'll try. Free everyday rest of 
week for sure.” ( .) At 3:03 p.m., Respondent texted, “50/50 on tonight. I'm for sure 
free rest of week/during the day.” ( .) At 3:17 p.m., Respondent texted, “I have a 2-3 
hour window everyday from like 9-noon when I can be free and everyday after 2. I only 
teach 8-9:10 and 12:30-2 p.m.” (Exhibit 11.)
67. On Thursday, December 16, 2021, at 9:05 a.m., Jane Doe 7 texted 
Respondent, “Wanna get naked at 1030???” (Exhibit 12.) Respondent stated he was 
covering another teacher’s class, but informed her, “I think I can be free like 11ish. . . I'll 
try and bail on work. Should be fine.” ( .) The 11:00 arrival time fell during 
Respondent’s Period 3 class time.
68. The night of December 20, 2021, Respondent and Jane Doe 7 arranged 
to meet on Tuesday, December 21, 2021, at 10:00 a.m. On December 21, 2021, at 9:52 
a.m., Respondent texted Jane Doe 7, “Waiting for my student teacher. He had a 
doctor’s appointment and should be here soon. I'll head over when he gets here.” 
(Exhibit 13.) At 10:06 a.m., Respondent texted Jane Doe 7, “Headed that way in 10 
min.” ( .) Respondent visited Jane Doe 7 at the end of his Period 2 prep and 25 through a part of his Period 3 class time. At 11:59 a.m., Respondent texted, “Great to 
[see you] as always. I’m ready for a nap now. [two emojis].” ( .) 
69. On January 10, 2022, Respondent and Jane Doe 7 arranged to meet 
between 9:00 a.m. and 12:15 on Tuesday, January 11, 2022. Respondent texted, “I'll be 
over 9-9:30. Free till 12:15, can come back later as wel[l]. . . . Well I gotta work 8-9:10 
am, I have first period with your daughter. So I can come over before or after.” (Exhibit 
14.) When Jane Doe 7asked whether Respondent would return to work after they met 
on Tuesday, Respondent texted, “I work 2 hours a day, think I can manage.” ( .)
Respondent’s proposed arrival and departure times fell during his Period 2 preparation 
period through the end of his Period 3 class time. 
70. On January 11, 2022, at 4:12 p.m., Respondent texted Jane Doe 7, “You 
will see me 9:30-noon tomorrow and again after 2 pm.” (Exhibit 15.) However, at 5:36 
p.m., Respondent texted Jane Doe 7, “My student teacher has Covid. That's why fuck! I 
will have to cover the classes. GOD DAMN IT.” (Exhibit 16.) Respondent assured Jane 
Doe 7 he would see her on Wednesday, January 12, 2022, stating, “I'll be free 9:15-
10:30, lunch and at 3:30, I'm gonna see u.” ( .) Respondent’s proposed free time 
between 9:15 to 10:30 a.m. fell during his Period 2 preparation time.
71. On January 17, 2022, Respondent texted Jane Doe 7 to arrange to meet 
the next day (Tuesday, January 18) stating, I should be free 9:30-12:30, and again 
around 2:30. Student teacher . . . hasn't texted me [back] though.” (Exhibit 17.) 
Respondent’s proposed arrival and departure times fell during his Period 2 preparation 
time through the end of his Period 3 class time. 
72. On Friday, February 4, 2022, in response to a text from Jane Doe 7, 
Respondent texted, “Sorry have been actually teaching. . . . Me leaving work isn’t 26 actually ok. I’m doing it to prioritize you.” (Exhibit 18.) At 9:59 a.m., Respondent texted, 
“Be there in 5 min.” ( .) Respondent visited Jane Doe 7 during his Period 2 
preparation time through his Period 3 class time. At 12:23 p.m., Respondent texted 
Jane Doe 7, “Fun morning. I smell like you.” ( .)
73. On Wednesday, February 9, 2022, at 9:37 a.m., Respondent texted Jane 
Doe 7, “I’ll be by in a bit.” (Exhibit 19.)
74. On Thursday, February 10, 2022, at 7:47 a.m., Respondent texted Jane 
Doe 7, “I am free 9:15-Noon.” (Exhibit 20.) He later confirmed he could visit her at 9:45 
a.m. ( .) Respondent’s proposed arrival and departure times fell during his Period 2 
preparation time through the end of his Period 3 class time. 
75. On Friday, February 11, 2022, Respondent texted Jane Doe 7, “I have 
work till 10:25. I have to cover my friend[’]s 2nd period class. [emoji]. . . . I am free 
10:30-12ish.” (Exhibit 21.) He later texted, “I’ll be by 10:30ish.” ( .) Respondent 
visited Jane Doe 7 that morning and left before 1:10 p.m. Respondent’s arrival and 
departure times fell at the end of his Period 2 preparation time through the end of his 
Period 3 class time.
76. During the second trimester of the 2021-2022 school year, O’Connor 
became concerned when he observed Respondent leaving the SLOHS campus 
repeatedly during the workday. The SLOHS campus can be accessed by a road running 
alongside the District offices where O’Connor worked. Consequently, O’Connor
noticed Respondent driving off campus at varying hours and on more occasions than 
other teachers. O’Connor reported his concerns to the SLOHS administration, including 
Dickenson and Assistant Principals Dellinger and Julie Mamo.27 77. On February 18, 2022, Mamo met with Respondent at SLOHS. During the 
meeting, Mamo notified Respondent he had been seen on several occasions leaving 
the campus during the workday. Respondent admitted leaving campus but did not tell 
her the actual reason for his absences. 
78. In a February 18, 2022 email to Dickenson, not copied to Respondent, 
Mamo wrote: 
I met with [Respondent] on Friday, Feb. 18, 2022. We 
discussed his schedule regarding his student teacher: 
Periods 1 and 4 - Jeff Teaches 
Periods 3 and 5 - Co Teaches 
He understands that he must remain on campus Periods 1 - 
5. If essential to leave, he may leave campus during his 2nd 
period Prep. 
(Exhibit 28.) 
79. Paragraph 96 of the ASOC alleges, “Respondent . . . told Ms. Mamo he 
was leaving campus to take his son to extracurricular activities. Ms. Mamo reminded 
Respondent that he needs to be on campus teaching his classes and with the student 
teacher. Respondent responded that he understood this directive and the District’s 
policies.” Mamo did not testify at the hearing to confirm what was specifically said 
during her meeting with Respondent on February 18, 2022. Consequently, the 
allegations in paragraph 96, set forth above, were not established by a preponderance 
of the evidence. 28 80. After meeting with Mamo on February 18, 2022, Respondent understood
he could leave campus during his preparation period for essential reasons, but he 
would have to stay on campus for his other class periods. 
81. After February 18, 2022, Respondent continued to leave the SLOHS 
campus during work hours to meet Jane Doe 7.
82. During the third trimester (March through June) of the 2021-2022 school 
year, Respondent’s schedule changed. Respondent’s teaching assignment was U.S. 
History and Geography during Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. His preparation period was Period 
5. Additionally, he no longer had a student teacher in his classroom. During Periods 1, 
2, 3, and 4, Respondent was required to be in his classroom. 
83. During the third trimester, Respondent continued to leave the SLOHS 
campus during his Period 5 preparation period to see Jane Doe 7. 
84. On Monday, March 28, 2022, Respondent texted Jane Doe 7 to inform 
her that he would be at her apartment around “2:20-2:30.” (Exhibit 24.) This arrival time 
frame was during Respondent’s Period 5 preparation time. 
85. On Thursday, April 28, 2022, Respondent texted Jane Doe 7, “I'll come 
over 1:30-1:50ish. Whenever I can get away.” (Exhibit 22.) This arrival time frame was 
during the end of Respondent’s Period 4 class through the beginning of Respondent’s 
Period 5 preparation time. 
86. At the hearing, Respondent admitted he left the SLOHS campus during 
the workday, three to four times per week, to have sex with Jane Doe 7 at her 
apartment. Respondent insisted he was never told he could not leave campus during 
his preparation period. He claimed that the standard practice is that “teacher prep 29 time [was] to be used how teachers saw fit.” He did not credibly explain how regularly 
leaving campus during work hours to engage in a sexual relationship with a student’s 
mother was an appropriate, “professional, job related” way to use his preparation time. 
Respondent begrudgingly admitted he also left campus during his Period 3 class time. 
However, he insisted the Period 3 student teacher held an emergency substitute 
teaching credential and could teach the class independently. Respondent did not 
credibly explain why he never reported to the District either his absences or the 
“substitute” teaching during class time for which Respondent was being paid. 
Respondent refused to admit that regularly leaving campus during his preparation and 
class times to engage in a sexual relationship with Jane Doe 7 was improper, despite 
his texts to Jane Doe indicating his awareness of the impropriety of his conduct (e.g., 
“Me leaving work isn’t actually ok.”). 
87. Paragraphs 98 and 99 of the ASOC allege that, as a result of 
Respondent’s relationship with Jane Doe 7, he gave Jane Doe 2 an “A” in his class 
despite her transcript showing lower grades in her other classes that trimester. The 
allegations in paragraphs 98 and 99 were not proven by a preponderance of the 
evidence. 
RESPONDENT ’S MISCONDUCT WITH JANE DOE 2 
88. The facts regarding Jane Doe 2 were established by the testimony of Jane 
Doe 2 and another former female SLOHS student, P.S., and by corroborating evidence. 
(The student’s initials are used to protect her privacy.) 
89. Jane Doe 2 testified in a generally credible manner except where 
specifically noted. She admitted that, when she was initially interviewed by the District 
in Fall 2022, she felt bad for Respondent and did not want to ruin his life, so she lied 30 and denied Respondent ever made inappropriate comments about female student’s 
bodies in his classroom. However, she confirmed that her testimony under oath at the 
hearing was truthful. 
90. P.S. testified in a straightforward and solemn manner. She presented as a 
credible witness. 
91. Jane Doe 2 is a graduate of SLOHS. She was 17 years old in June 2022, 
and she turned 18 before her graduation in 2023. 
92. In June 2022, Respondent and Jane Doe 2’s mother, Jane Doe 7, had 
been involved in a sexual relationship for several months. Jane Doe 2 agreed to 
babysit for Respondent on June 11, 2022. On June 10, 2022, Respondent texted Jane 
Doe 2, and he informed her she could “swim/layout in the backyard” while babysitting. 
Respondent also texted Jane Doe 2, “[smiley emoji] have a good night. Don’t get too 
drunk. [two laughing emojis]. Thanks for babysitting.” (Exhibit 7, p. A247.) 
93. On June 11, 2022, after 12:45 p.m., Jane Doe 2 went to Respondent’s 
home to babysit his children and other children who were staying at his house. P.S. 
helped Jane Doe 2 babysit that day. 
94. Respondent, his wife, and two other adults left to go wine tasting. 
95. On June 11, 2022, at 1:05 p.m., Respondent texted Jane Doe 2, “How bad 
are your hickeys??? Damn.” (Exhibit 7, p. A246.) Later that afternoon, Respondent 
texted Jane Doe 2, “Go in the pool/hot tub. Kids are fine. They don’t need you to hold 
their hands. . . . Thanks girl. Appreciate you. Your hickeys are still terrible. [laughing 
emoji].” ( .) 31 96. Paragraph 52 of the ASOC alleges that “Jane Doe 2 did not respond to 
[Respondent’s] attempts to get her to talk about hickeys she had on her neck” because 
“Respondent’s behavior made Jane Doe 2 uncomfortable.” Jane Doe 2 testified 
Respondent’s comments made her uncomfortable because that was the first time she 
had hickeys, and she was embarrassed. However, P.S. testified that Jane Doe 2 often 
joked with her friends about her hickeys. The dates of their conversations were not 
established by the evidence. The preponderance of the evidence did not establish the 
allegations in paragraph 52. 
97. On June 11, 2022, P.S. left Respondent’s home for another appointment 
before the adults returned. Later that evening, Respondent and one other adult 
returned home from wine tasting. 
98. As Respondent and Jane Doe 2 were standing in Respondent’s home 
talking, Respondent asked Jane Doe 2 if she was wearing a bathing suit under her 
clothing. Jane Doe 2 began to feel uncomfortable. Respondent asked Jane Doe 2 why 
she did not go into the pool. 
99. Respondent then asked Jane Doe 2 when she turned 18. Jane Doe 2 
thought it was a strange question since Respondent had recently celebrated her 17th 
birthday with her. She felt uncomfortable. However, the context and tone of 
Respondent’s question were not established by the preponderance of the evidence. 
100. Respondent then initiated physical contact with Jane Doe 2. Respondent 
testified he tapped Jane Doe 2 on her shoulder and tugged her shirt. Jane Doe 2 
testified Respondent tugged on the belt loop of her shorts. The specific physical 
contact was not established by the preponderance of the evidence. However, the 32 evidence established Respondent engaged in some physical contact with Jane Doe 2’s 
clothing that made her feel uncomfortable at that moment. 
101. Respondent then left his home, and Jane Doe 2 continued babysitting 
the children. 
102. After the June 11, 2022 babysitting incident, Jane Doe 2 texted Jane Doe 
7, who was in Italy. Jane Doe 2 informed her mother there was an incident with 
Respondent while babysitting that made her uncomfortable, and they would talk 
about it when Jane Doe 7 returned home. After Jane Doe 7 returned home, Jane Doe 2 
provided her with the details of Respondent’s actions that made her feel 
uncomfortable. Jane Doe 2 told Jane Doe 7 that Respondent was “being creepy” and 
she did not want to be alone with him again. 
103. Paragraphs 42 through 44 of the ASOC allege that Respondent gave Jane 
Doe 2 $500 in cash as “an apology” for his behavior and that he purchased numerous 
gifts for Jane Doe 2 and Jane Doe 7. The allegations in paragraphs 42 through 44 were 
not established by a preponderance of the evidence. 
104. Jane Doe 7 and Respondent continued to have a sexual relationship until 
the end of July 2022. 
105. In numerous text messages after June 11, 2022, Respondent informed 
Jane Doe 2 that Jane Doe 7 was mad at him. Respondent asserted in the texts that 
Jane Doe 7 was angry because Respondent was supposed to pick up Jane Doe 7 from 
the airport after her international trip and he had asked Jane Doe 2 to pick her up 
instead. 33 106. Jane Doe 7 confirmed she was angry at Respondent but explained her 
anger arose when she learned Respondent “made a pass at” her daughter. Jane Doe 7 
was particularly upset because Respondent’s conduct toward Jane Doe 2 occurred 
after Jane Doe 7 and Respondent had engaged in a sexual relationship for many 
months. Jane Doe 7 admitted she wanted to “destroy” Respondent at that point. 
However, her extreme anger about the situation does not diminish her credibility 
because other evidence corroborated her testimony. 
107. Despite the June 11, 2022 incident, Jane Doe 2 and Jane Doe 7 accepted 
Respondent’s help filling out Jane Doe 2’s college applications. 
108. On August 3, 2022, Respondent texted Jane Doe 7, “Now you are ‘gonna 
go to the school board’[?]” (Exhibit 26.) Jane Doe 7 responded, “Fuck off jeff. I’m not 
eating more time on your lies. It’s over.” ( .) Respondent texted, “SO YOU GO TO 
THE SCHOOL BOARD THIS WILL HAPPEN 1. I will be out on [p]aid leave 2. The district 
will hire a lawyer to look at every text between us. 3. I will lose my job 4. Every detail/ 
picture text etc. will be published and put in a report and go to the media. Do not do 
this [Jane Doe 7]. It is going to ruin my life. And hurt you. [Jane Doe 2.] My kids. Stop 
it.” (.) 
RESPONDENT ’S INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS IN CLASS AND ON BREAKS
109. The facts regarding Respondent’s inappropriate classroom comments 
were established by the credible testimony of P.S., Jane Doe 2, and Jane Doe 3. 
110. Jane Doe 3 is a graduate of SLOHS. She was a senior during the 2022-
2023 school year. She testified in an even and candid manner, and she presented as a 
credible witness. 34 111. During the 2021-2022 school year and the first trimester of the 2022-
2023 school year, students spent their breaks and lunch time in Respondent’s 
classroom. Respondent was known among students as the “cool teacher” and the “kick 
back surfer” teacher who “wanted to be more of a friend than a teacher.” (Testimony of 
P.S. and Jane Doe 3) This characterization of Respondent was corroborated by a video 
P.S. took of Respondent in his classroom during the 2021-20221 school year. 
Respondent overheard P.S. and her friends bantering during class about growing up to 
be “country club moms,” and he joked, “If you’re gonna be a country club mom, you 
gotta start exercising more.” P.S. asked to video record him saying that, and he 
allowed her to do so, smiling while repeating the joke. (Exhibit 6.) 
112. Throughout the 2021-2022 school year and Fall 2022, during class time 
and lunch time in Respondent’s classroom, Respondent made inappropriate comments 
about female students’ bodies. For example, when the weather was hot and the female 
students wore short shorts, tank tops, or tube tops, Respondent often commented, 
“It’s a tits-out, ass-out type of day.” (Testimony of P.S. and Jane Doe 2.) Respondent 
told the female students he liked the warm weather when girls wore short shorts. 
When a female student wore a crop top, Respondent would ask, “Where is the rest of 
your shirt?” (Testimony of Jane Doe 2.) When the weather was cold, Respondent would 
tell female students, “I can see your nipples.” (Testimony of P.S. and Jane Doe 2.) Once 
when Jane Doe 2 was wearing a push-up bra, her friends commented that her boobs 
looked bigger, and Respondent agreed Jane Doe 2’s “boobs look bigger.” (Testimony 
of Jane Doe 2.) Respondent also asked Jane Doe 2 if she had lost her virginity yet. 
(.)35 RESPONDENT ’S MISCONDUCT WITH JANE DOE 1 
113. Jane Doe 1 testified at the administrative hearing about the 
inappropriate texts between her and Respondent. Jane Doe 1’s credibility was 
questionable. Jane Doe 2 and P.S. characterized Jane Doe 1 as dishonest, and P.S. 
noted that Jane Doe 1 said she was “scared” and was going to show only selected and 
edited texts to the District because Respondent was to blame as the adult. Jane Doe 1 
also has a motivation to be untruthful in her testimony in light of the civil lawsuit she 
filed against Respondent and the District. Consequently, her testimony was unreliable 
to establish the facts regarding her interactions with Respondent. 
114. As noted above, Respondent’s testimony in general lacked credibility. 
Specifically, regarding Jane Doe 1, Respondent’s testimony that he tried to stop her 
from texting him was belied by his actions, as he kept responding to her texts in a 
manner that encouraged further communication. Respondent did not attempt to block 
Jane Doe 1’s texts or notify administrative staff. Consequently, Respondent’s testimony 
was unreliable to establish the facts of his interactions with Jane Doe 1. 
115. The facts regarding Jane Doe 1, set forth below, are only those 
established by credible evidence, including the credible testimony of P.S., Jane Doe 2, 
Jane Doe 3, and corroborating evidence. 
116. Jane Doe 1 is a graduate of SLOHS. She was a 17-year-old senior during 
the 2022-2023 school year. 
117. Respondent’s cell phone number was readily known to numerous SLOHS 
students, including Jane Doe 2 and Jane Doe 3. 36 118. On an unknown date before October 7, 2022, Jane Doe 1 obtained 
Respondent’s cell phone number. 
119. Jane Doe 1 expressed interest in working at Respondent’s family’s 
Pumpkin Patch. Prior to October 7, 2022, Jane Doe 1 texted Respondent about 
working at The Pumpkin Patch asking, “What do you even do[?]” Respondent 
answered, “Smile. Sell pumpkins. Make $.” Jane Doe 1 texted, “What I’m best at 
[winking emoji]” Respondent answered, “Flirt.” (Exhibit 2.) 
120. On the evening of October 7, 2022, Jane Doe 1 and Respondent sent 
several texts to each other. 
121. The evidence depicting the content of Jane Doe 1 and Respondent’s texts 
is incomplete because Jane Doe 1 deleted and edited some parts of the text string, 
including texts and photos, prior to production to the District. (Exhibit 3.) However, a 
portion of the unabridged text exchange was captured in a video recording showing 
Jane Doe 1’s cellphone screen. (Exhibit 4.) The evidence established that the October 7, 
2022 text exchange between Jane Doe 1 and Respondent occurred as set forth below. 
122. On October 7, 2022, in response to an unviewable text from Jane Doe 1, 
Respondent sent a “face palm” emoji. Jane Doe 1 then sent Respondent a smiling 
picture of herself with the camera angled downward to capture her face and chest. 
Respondent texted, “See you at work tomorrow girl! [star eyes smiley face emoji].” 
Jane Doe 1 texted, “Yes you will! Bring me a beer in a water bottle. Would ya.” 
Respondent answered, “So many things I want to say.” Jane Doe texted, “What do you 
mean, say them.” Jane Doe then switched the topic to her working at The Pumpkin 
Patch on October 8, asking Respondent when he would be there, and he informed her, 
“330ish. Thanks girl! Appreciate you.” There are several additional texts between them 37 where Respondent answers Jane Doe 1’s texts at least four more times, but the 
content of these texts is unreadable. (Exhibits 3 and 4.) 
123. Respondent testified he sent the “palm face” and “star eyes smiley face” 
emojis and the text, “so many things I want to say,” as a way of telling Jane Doe 1 to 
stop texting him. This assertion is disingenuous and devoid of credibility. No 
reasonable person would construe these emojis and the “so many things I want to say” 
text as a way of telling the student to stop texting. Respondent had several 
opportunities to specifically tell Jane Doe 1 to stop texting him but instead continued 
the conversation until their inappropriate texting was discovered. 
124. During the weekend of October 7, 2022, two SLOHS students hosted a 
house party attended by other SLOHS students. Jane Doe 1 attended the party and 
showed some of her friends the text messages she exchanged with Respondent. 
Students at the party made a video recording of Jane Doe 1’s cellphone screen 
showing the text messages. The text messages then became a source of gossip among 
SLOHS students. 
125. Jane Doe 1 worked at The Pumpkin Patch on the morning of Saturday, 
October 8, 2022. That morning, Respondent drove SLOHS students to Santa Barbara 
for basketball games, and he did not arrive at The Pumpkin Patch until after 3:30 p.m. 
126. Jane Doe 1 and Respondent worked at The Pumpkin Patch on Sunday 
morning, October 9, 2022. While at The Pumpkin Patch, Respondent confronted Jane 
Doe 1 about their text conversations. Respondent asked Jane Doe 1, “Are you trying to 
get me fired?” 
127. Paragraph 19 of the ASOC alleges, Respondent then made Jane Doe 1 
change his name in her phone from “Daddy Brandow” to “Thomas.” This allegation was 38 not proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Although Jane Doe 1 changed 
Respondent’s contact name in her phone from “Daddy Brandow” to “Thomas,” the 
preponderance of the evidence did not establish she did so on Respondent’s demand. 
128. By Monday, October 10, 2022, Jane Doe 2 heard student rumors about 
the text messages between Respondent and Jane Doe 1. That morning, Jane Doe 2 
went to Respondent’s classroom to tell him about the rumors and that students were 
circulating screen shots. She joked with Respondent, “You may want to get a lawyer 
because other students told [her the texts] were inappropriate messages.” (Testimony 
of Jane Doe 2.) Respondent “freaked out.” ( .) Respondent told her she could be 
pulled in for questioning by the principal, and he asked her, “What are you going to 
say? This could go badly for me.” Jane Doe 2 recalled, “His tone of voice was ‘please 
protect me.’” Respondent told Jane Doe 2 to pull out her cellphone and delete the text 
messages between him and her. Jane Doe 2 complied.
129. When Jane Doe 2 left Respondent’s classroom, she immediately called 
and told her mother, Jane Doe 7, what Respondent instructed her to do. Jane Doe 7 
told Jane Doe 2 to retrieve the deleted text messages between Respondent and Jane 
Doe 2. Jane Doe 2 recovered and took screen shots of her texts with Respondent. 
130. Paragraph 24 of the ASOC alleges that Respondent asked Jane Doe 2 
how to delete messages from his phone, and he directed her to delete the messages 
between him and Jane Doe 1. These allegations were not proven by a preponderance 
of the evidence.
131. That same day, October 10, 2022, at 12:16 p.m., Respondent texted Jane 
Doe 1, “Please come to my classroom immediately.” Jane Doe 1 responded, “Why,” and 39 Respondent texted, “It’s important.” Jane Doe 1 again asked, “Why. I’m in class.” (Lunch 
started at 12:34 p.m.) Respondent repeated, “It’s important.” (Exhibit 5.) 
132. Jane Doe 1 did not go to Respondent’s classroom immediately. However, 
after lunch, as she and Jane Doe 3 were walking by Respondent’s classroom to enter 
their ceramics class in the classroom next to his, Respondent told them to step into his 
classroom. 
133. The preponderance of the evidence did not establish Respondent ever 
grabbed Jane Doe 1’s wrist. 
134. Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 3 entered Respondent’s classroom as he 
instructed. Jane Doe 3 recalled Respondent appeared extremely stressed, which 
differed from his typical, calm, “kick back at the beach” demeanor. Respondent did not 
yell at them, but he raised his voice and demanded that they delete his contact 
information and all of his text messages from their phones. At that point, Jane Doe 3 
was aware of the text messages between Respondent and Jane Doe 1, but Jane Doe 3 
had not seen them. Jane Doe 3 told Respondent, “I barely ever text you. I text my 
advisors more, [but] out of respect, I will delete them.” (Testimony of Jane Doe 3.) Jane 
Doe 1 and Jane Doe 3 left Respondent’s classroom. While walking into their ceramics 
class, Jane Doe 3 deleted Respondent’s contact information and text messages from 
her cellphone. 
135. On or after October 10, 2022, P.S. went to Respondent’s classroom to 
discuss the texts between him and Jane Doe 1. Respondent told her that his texts to 
Jane Doe 1 meant, “You should not be texting me like this.” (Testimony of P.S.) P.S. 
trusted Respondent and believed his explanation at that time. Respondent mentioned 
the investigation into his conduct, and he told P.S. that Jane Doe 1 was “going after” 40 him, and his students “should be on his side.” P.S. believed Respondent wanted his 
students “to agree with everything he has done,” “defend him and his reputation,” and 
“stand up for him, not [Jane Doe 1].” 
136. Despite his testimony asserting his innocence, Respondent could not 
credibly explain why he declined to report Jane Doe 1’s texting to the District or 
provide the texts to the District. Respondent did not credibly explain why, on October 
10, 2022, he still had Jane Doe 1’s cellphone number after purportedly deleting her 
texts and why he texted Jane Doe 1 to meet him so he could tell her to delete their 
texts. His agitation and actions on October 10, 2022, were not indicative of someone 
who had engaged in innocent behavior, but rather were the apparent efforts of 
someone striving to cover up misconduct. 
RESPONDENT ’S DISHONESTY
137. When District personnel interviewed Respondent before issuing the 45-
day notice in December 2021, Respondent maintained the text message chain 
between Jane Doe 1 and himself was appropriate. Respondent informed District 
personnel he deleted the entire text message chain in accordance with his regular
practice of deleting all iMessage conversations. However, Respondent showed 
Dickenson some of the non-incriminating texts relating to students working at The 
Pumpkin Patch. Respondent did not explain to District personnel why he declined to 
report Jane Doe 1’s texting to the District, why he continued texting Jane Doe 1 on 
October 10, 2022, and why Jane Doe 1’s contact number remained on his phone.
138. When District personnel confronted Respondent with his text to Jane 
Doe 1 stating “so many things I want to say,” Respondent deceitfully explained he was 
conveying to Jane Doe 1 that he was upset. As noted above, no reasonable person 41 would construe “so many things I want to say” as a way of telling the student he was 
upset or that he wanted her to stop texting. Respondent had already texted, “Flirt” and 
other messages to Jane Doe 1, and he had numerous opportunities to tell Jane Doe 1 
to stop texting him, but he continued the conversation until his misconduct was 
discovered. 
139. During the initial stage of the District’s investigation, Block, Dickenson, 
and Dellinger interviewed P.S. She acknowledged there were texts between Jane Doe 1 
and Respondent, but she withheld information about the party where the video 
recording of Jane Doe 1’s phone was made. P.S. also acknowledged there were 
conversations in Respondent’s classroom about girls’ prom dresses, but she offered no 
additional information about Respondent’s inappropriate comments. P.S. was “hesitant 
to share” information at that time because she “was not sure . . . whose side [she] 
should be on,” and she thought she “did something wrong and would be punished.” 
140. During the initial stage of the District investigation, Dickenson, Dellinger, 
and another man she did not recognize (likely Block) interviewed Jane Doe 2. She was 
asked about the text messages between Jane Doe 1 and Respondent and about 
comments Respondent made during class. Jane Doe 2 lied and said Respondent “was a 
good guy” and did not make inappropriate comments in class. She lied to protect 
Respondent because she noticed Respondent started wearing his wedding ring again 
after the rumors of the texts came out. Jane Doe 2 did not want Respondent to get 
into any more trouble. She later decided to testify truthfully because she realized what 
happened “was not right” and she “did not want anyone else to go through that.” 
141. Respondent’s efforts to get Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and Jane Doe 3 to 
delete his contact information and all text messages between him and them prevented 
the District from determining the full extent of Respondent’s text messaging with 42 students. Additionally, Respondent’s manipulation of impressionable teenage students
to stand up for him, thus prompting their initial evasive and dishonest responses to 
the District, prevented the District from determining the extent of Respondent’s 
misconduct in the classroom. 
142. Respondent was dishonest with District administrators when they asked 
about his interactions with Jane Doe 1. Respondent was also dishonest by engaging in 
efforts to avoid detection of his misconduct, including deleting the text messages on 
his cellphone and asking Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and Jane Doe 3 to delete text 
messages from their cellphones. 
143. Respondent was also dishonest in leaving the SLOHS campus regularly 
during paid work hours (preparation time and class time) for non-work-related reasons 
which he did not disclose to Mamo or the District. 
144. As discussed above, Respondent continued his dishonesty during his 
testimony, which was replete with his refusal to admit his proven misconduct, denials 
of his efforts to hide text messages, and disingenuous explanations of his text 
messages and other misconduct. 
VIOLATION OF BOARD POLICIES
145. Respondent repeatedly violated Board Policy BP4119.21 by failing to: 
“maintain the highest ethical standards,” “behave professionally,” “exercise good 
judgment when interacting with students and other members of the school 
community,” and “engage in conduct that enhances the integrity of the district.” 
Instead, Respondent exercised poor judgment by regularly leaving campus during paid 
work hours to engage in a sexual relationship with a student’s mother. Respondent 43 engaged in “harassing behavior towards” Jane Doe 4 and 5, used “profane, obscene . . .
language” with students in his classroom, and was “dishonest with [District] staff.” 
146. Respondent violated Board Policy BP4119.24 in failing to maintain 
appropriate adult-student interactions with students, as evidenced by his text 
messages with Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, his physical contact with Jane Doe 2, and 
his inappropriate comments to female students in his classroom. Respondent failed to 
“maintain the highest professional and ethical standards in [his] interactions with 
students both within and outside the educational setting.” Instead, Respondent
engaged in “inappropriate interactions with students” including “boundary-blurring 
behaviors that undermine trust in the adult-student relationship and lead to the 
appearance of impropriety.” Respondent engaged in the “sexual harassment” of 
students, including “flirtations,” “inappropriate comments about a student's body or 
appearance,” and “maintaining personal contact with a student that has no legitimate 
educational purpose, by . . . electronic communications . . . without including the 
student's parent/guardian or the principal.” Respondent inappropriately 
“communicat[ed] electronically with students,” on his cellphone that has the means to 
“eliminate the records of communications” rather than on recommended “[D]istrict 
equipment.” 
147. Respondent violated Board Policy BP 4030 by harassing his co-workers, 
Jane Doe 4 and Jane Doe 5, and creating an offensive work environment for them. 
Publicity and Impact on District and Students 
148. After March 2023, numerous news articles about Respondent’s 
inappropriate behavior with Jane Doe 1 and other unnamed students and staff 
appeared in the local press. These included: a July 8, 2023 article titled, “SLO High 44 School's former athletic director accused of sexual misconduct, on leave” (Exhibit 50); a 
July 11, 2023 article titled, “SLO coach allegedly pursued underage student, left on the 
job” (Exhibit 51); a July 12, 2023 article titled, “SLO High School teacher, basketball 
coach on leave after misconduct allegations” (Exhibit 48); a July 20, 2023 article titled, 
“SLO High School coach on paid leave over alleged inappropriate behavior with 
student” (Exhibit 43); a September 5, 2023 article titled, “San Luis High School's long 
history of covering up sexual misconduct” (Exhibit 52); a September 19, 2023 article 
titled, “Emails expose SLO High School's failure to protect students” (Exhibit 53); a 
November 14, 2023 article titled, “Former San Luis Obispo High School teacher, school 
district face lawsuit over alleged sexual harassment” (Exhibit 49); a November 16, 2023 
article titled, “Lawsuit against former SLO High coach details years of sexual 
harassment allegations” (Exhibit 44); a November 7, 2023 article titled, “Police: No 
criminal case against former SLO High coach accused of sexual harassing student” 
(Exhibit 45); a November 14, 2023 article titled, “Former SLO High School student sues 
over alleged sexual misconduct” (Exhibit 54); a December 6, 2023 article titled, 
“California coach was considered for promotion after girl accused him of harassment, 
emails show” (Exhibit 46); and a February 22, 2024 article titled, “SLO school district 
says it's not liable for sexual harassment by former basketball coach” (Exhibit 47). 
Additionally, an online attorney advertisement during the same time frame stated, “We 
are currently accepting potential claims for review involving allegations of 
inappropriate verbal and physical harassment by former San Luis Obispo High School 
coach, Jeff Brandow. If you or someone you know was a victim of such alleged 
harassment, contact our offices.” (Exhibit 55.) 
149. Several District administrators and students testified credibly at the 
administrative hearing regarding the impact of Respondent’s behavior on the students 
and the District. 45 150. Jane Doe 3 testified Respondent’s conduct and numerous news articles 
have changed the way she previously viewed relationships, and she questions if she let 
comments go over her head. She noted she was 17 when Respondent told her to 
delete texts, and “when an adult tells you to do something, you do it.” This has 
affected her ability to trust. 
151. P.S. testified that when Respondent’s actions became public and the 
news articles came out, her “whole belief” changed, and she became uncomfortable 
about Respondent’s conduct.
152. Dickenson noted educators typically receive a high degree of trust. 
However, since Respondent’s misconduct came to light, “that trust has been 
challenged,” and parents and students have vocalized their concerns and doubts about 
whether students are safe at SLOHS. 
153. Block testified the intense news coverage significantly affected the 
District, its staff, and its students, particularly students at SLOHS. Staff and students are 
now “in a position where students are questioning who is a trusted adult.” 
154. Several witnesses indicated that the school community relationships have 
become fragmented.
LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 
Jurisdiction 
1. The Commission has jurisdiction to proceed in this matter pursuant to 
Education Code section 44944. (Factual Findings 1, 2, and 18.)46 Burden of Proof
2. The District has the burden of proof in this matter since it is seeking to 
dismiss Respondent from employment as a certificated employee. The standard of 
proof is preponderance of the evidence. (
(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 1035, 1040.)
Motions in Limine
MOTION IN LIMINE #1–STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS –JANE DOE 6:
3. Among other things, the SOC alleged, and the ASOC alleges and attaches 
exhibits incorporated by reference to establish, Respondent engaged in misconduct 
regarding Jane Doe 6, a member of the local press covering school sports, until she 
filed a request for restraining order on August 7, 2018, and obtained a restraining 
order against Respondent on August 22, 2018. The SOC and ASOC do not indicate 
when and how the District became aware of Respondent’s alleged misconduct with 
Jane Doe 6.
4. Respondent sought to prelude all allegations and evidence pertaining to 
Jane Doe 6 by arguing they are time barred pursuant to the Education Code. 
5. Education Code section 44944, subdivision (b)(2)(A), provides:
Testimony shall not be given or evidence shall not be 
introduced relating to matters that occurred more than four 
years before the date of the filing of the notice, except in 
one of the following circumstances: 47 (i) Testimony or evidence regarding allegations of behavior 
or communication of a sexual nature with a pupil that is 
beyond the scope or requirements of the educational 
program . . . may be introduced in a disciplinary proceeding 
. . . where such allegations have been substantiated through 
an investigation or proceeding, or for which the employee 
was subject to discipline or other form of penalty.
(ii) Testimony or evidence regarding allegations of an act 
described in Section 288 of the Penal Code with respect to 
a pupil of any age, Section 288.3 of the Penal Code, Section 
44010 of this code, or Sections 11165.2 to 11165.6, 
inclusive, of the Penal Code may be introduced in any 
disciplinary proceeding. 
6. The allegations regarding Jane Doe 6 involve matters that occurred
before August 7, 2018, which is more than four years before the August 16, 2023 date 
of the filing of the original notice of intent to dismiss and SOC. The allegations 
regarding Jane Doe 6 do not involve behavior or communication of a sexual nature 
with a pupil, and the District has not established any exceptions to the four-year bar. 
7. In its Opposition, the District maintained the doctrine of equitable 
estoppel applies to overcome the four-year bar. 
8. The California Supreme Court, in 
( ) (2007) 41 Cal.4th 227, held the four-year time limitation is not absolute. A
district meeting the requirements of equitable estoppel could be allowed to introduce 48 evidence of, and base its dismissal proceedings on, incidents falling outside the four-
year window. ( , , 41 Cal. 4th at p. 233.)
9. The doctrine of equitable estoppel generally requires the establishment 
of four elements: (1) the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts; (2) the 
party to be estopped must intend or reasonably believe that their conduct will be 
acted upon, or must act such that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to 
believe it was so intended; (3) the party asserting the estoppel must be ignorant of the 
true state of facts; and (4) the party asserting the estoppel must actually rely upon the 
other party’s conduct to their detriment or injury. ( (1970) 
3 Cal.3d 462, 489;  ( ) (1979) 97 Cal. App. 3d 249, 
258.) 
10. “Mere silence would not create estoppel unless the silent party was 
under some obligation to speak, and a party invoking such estoppel must show that it 
was the duty of the other to speak, that he has been induced to act by reason of the 
silence, and that the silent party had reasonable cause to believe that he would so act.” 
( , 97 Cal. App. 3d at p. 262.)
11. “More specifically, to overcome an apparent limitations bar, the plaintiff 
claiming delayed discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action has the burden 
of setting forth pleaded facts to show “‘(1) the time and manner of discovery and (2) 
the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence. The burden is 
on the plaintiff to show diligence, and conclusory allegations will not withstand 
demurrer.’” (  (2012) 208 Cal. App. 4th 166, 175. 
12. In attempting to establish equitable estoppel, the District contended in 
its Opposition, “Not only did Respondent instill fear into Jane Doe 6, which very likely 49 deterred her from coming forward, he also actively concealed his sexual harassment of 
Jane Doe 6 from the District. The District relied on the fact that there were no reports 
of Respondent’s misconduct relating to Jane Doe 6 and did not discover that 
Respondent had been engaging in such misconduct until the Cal Coast News article 
was published in July of 2023. The principle of equitable estoppel clearly applies in this 
matter because through his concealment to the District and intimidation of Jane Doe 
6, Respondent actively concealed his misconduct, which left the District only being 
able to discover it outside of the four-year time limit.” (Opposition, p. 5.) 
13. The District fails to establish that equitable estoppel should be applied in 
this case to admit evidence of Respondent’s alleged misconduct with Jane Doe 6. The 
District’s speculative assertion that Respondent’s alleged misconduct “very likely 
deterred [Jane Doe 6] from coming forward” is insufficient. The SOC and ASOC do not 
allege, nor did the District make an offer of proof, that Respondent actively deterred 
Jane Doe 6 from reporting his harassment to the District. The SOC and ASOC do not 
allege, nor did the District make an offer of proof, that Respondent engaged in any 
specific conduct, which the District reasonably relied upon, to prevent the District from 
discovering Respondent’s alleged misconduct with Jane Doe 6. Rather, in its 
Opposition, the District asserts Respondent concealed his misbehavior and the District 
relied on his silence. As noted in mere silence cannot establish estoppel unless 
Respondent had an obligation to speak, and the District did not establish Respondent 
had a duty to report his alleged misconduct. Furthermore, the SOC and ASOC do not 
allege, nor did the District make an offer of proof, that it employed reasonable 
diligence to discover Respondent’s alleged misconduct with Jane Doe 6 before August 
2023. 50 14. Given the foregoing, Respondent’s Motion in Limine #1 was granted, and 
any evidence pertaining to Jane Doe 6 was excluded. 
MOTIONS IN LIMINE #2 AND #3–ED.CODE § 44031 AND  
15. Respondent filed Motion in Limine #2 and #3 to exclude evidence 
pertaining to Jane Doe 5 and Jane Doe 4, respectively, on grounds that the SOC’s 
allegations related to Jane Doe 5 and Jane Doe 4 contain derogatory information 
concerning Respondent which the District relied on to terminate Respondent’s 
employment but which was not provided to Respondent for review and response 
before serving him with the Notice of Intent to Dismiss, as required by Education Code 
section 44031 and  (1979) 24 Cal.3d. 703 ( ). 
16. Education Code section 44031, subdivision (b)(1) provides, in pertinent 
part; 
Information of a derogatory nature shall not be entered 
into an employee's personnel records unless and until the 
employee is given notice and an opportunity to review and 
comment on that information. The employee shall have the 
right to enter, and have attached to any derogatory 
statement, his or her own comments.
17. Analyzing the requirements of Education Code section 44031, the 
California Supreme Court in reasoned: 
[P]ursuant to [Ed. Code 44031,] a school [employee] must 
be permitted to review and comment on derogatory written 
material compiled and maintained by a school district even 51 though the material has not been properly placed in his 
personnel file. A school board cannot avoid the 
requirements of section 44031 by putting derogatory 
written material in another file not designated “personnel 
file” and by such a process of labelling prevent the 
[employee] from reviewing and commenting upon 
allegations directed against him. 
Moreover, in order to enforce the mandate of section 
44031, we construe the provision to prohibit a school board 
from basing any employment decision on its analysis of 
derogatory information unless the board has notified the 
employee of such derogatory information and has afforded 
him an opportunity to comment upon it. 
( , 24 Cal.3d. 703 at p. 707.)
18. However, the court indicated a school board’s consideration of 
derogatory material alone does not prevent it from acting on it; the material must be a 
crucial element in the school board’s decision. Specifically, the  court noted, “The 
school board apparently did improperly consider some derogatory information in 
reaching its decision to reassign plaintiff. Because the trial court did not decide 
whether the improper material was a crucial element in the board's decision, we 
remand the case to the trial court for that determination.” (24 Cal. 3d 703, 707.) 
19. and Education Code section 44031 address the use of derogatory 
written material compiled and maintained by a school district even though the 
material has not been properly placed in a personnel file. In this case, prior to taking 52 evidence at hearing, it was not yet clear what derogatory material, if any, was reduced 
to writing (including electronic writings), and maintained in a file other than 
Respondent’s personnel file. Prior to taking evidence at hearing, it was also not clear 
what, if any, derogatory material the District relied on as a crucial element in its 
decision to issue the original Notice of Intent to Dismiss. These facts must be 
established by the evidence, after the record is opened. The Commission was tasked 
with determining: (1) if there were any derogatory writings on which the District relied 
and were crucial to the District’s decision to issue the August 2023 Notice of Intent to 
Dismiss, and (2) whether such writing was not properly placed in Respondent’s 
personnel file or he was not notified of it and afforded an opportunity to comment 
before the District acted on it. Given the foregoing, Respondent’s Motions in Limine #2 
and 3 were denied. 
20. As set forth in the Factual Findings, Beddall created a shared Google 
document containing information about Respondent’s inappropriate conduct with 
Jane Doe 4. The evidence did not establish what specific derogatory information was 
contained in that Google document. Beddall shared the Google document with then 
Principal O’Connor and forwarded it to the District’s Human Resources Department. 
Beddall also forwarded Jane Doe 5’s complaint about Respondent to the District’s 
Human Resources Department. No documentation of Respondent’s inappropriate 
behavior with Jane Doe 4 or Jane Doe 5 was placed in Respondent’s personnel file, and 
Respondent was not questioned about it. However, the District did not follow up on 
the Google document or Jane Doe 5’s complaint, and the District did not rely on the 
Google document or Jane Doe 5’s complaint as crucial factors in the District’s decision 
to issue the August 2023 Notice of Intent to Dismiss. The District did not investigate 
Respondent’s inappropriate behavior with Jane Doe 4 or Jane Doe 5 until well after the 
45-day notice was issued in December 2022 and after July 2023 news articles appeared 53 in the local press reporting facts similar to Jane Doe 4’s and Jane Doe 5’s situations 
with Respondent. District counsel did not contact Jane Doe 4 or Jane Doe 5 until after 
the news articles appeared. The Google document was not forwarded to District 
counsel until after the District filed the original SOC in August 2023. 
21. Since the District did not base any employment decision about 
Respondent on its analysis of the purported derogatory information in the Google 
document or Jane Doe 5’s complaint, the allegations regarding Jane Doe 4 and Jane 
Doe 5 are not barred. 
MOTION IN LIMINE #4– 45-DAY NOTICE OF UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT 
22. Respondent filed Motion in Limine #4 to exclude evidence regarding 
unprofessional conduct based on the District’s failure to provide notice of 
unprofessional conduct as set forth in Education Code section 44938. 
23. Education Code section 44938 provides, in pertinent part: 
(a) The governing board of any school district shall not act 
upon any charges of unprofessional conduct unless at least 
45 calendar days prior to the date of the filing, the board or 
its authorized representative has given the employee 
against whom the charge is filed, written notice of the 
unprofessional conduct, specifying the nature thereof with 
such specific instances of behavior and with such 
particularity as to furnish the employee an opportunity to 
correct his or her faults and overcome the grounds for the 
charge. [¶] . . . [¶] 54 (c) . . . “Unprofessional conduct” as used in this section 
means, and refers to, the unprofessional conduct 
particularly specified as a cause for dismissal or suspension 
in Sections 44932 and 44933 and does not include any 
other cause for dismissal specified in Section 44932. 
24. On December 29, 2022, the District gave Respondent a 45-day Notice of 
Unprofessional Conduct regarding Respondent’s conduct with Jane Doe 1 and Jane 
Doe 3. The SOC was filed August 15, 2023, and the Notice of Intent to Dismiss was 
issued August 16, 2023, more than 45 days from the December 2022 Notice of 
Unprofessional Conduct. However, the original SOC also alleged Respondent’s 
unprofessional conduct regarding Jane Doe 2, Jane Doe 4, and Jane Doe 5, and the 
ASOC added allegations of unprofessional conduct regarding Jane Doe 7. The 
December 2022 Notice of Unprofessional Conduct did not specifically mention Jane 
Doe 2, Jane Doe 4, Jane Doe 5, or Jane Doe 7, and the District did not provide separate 
45-day Notices of Unprofessional Conduct regarding Jane Doe 2, Jane Doe 4, Jane Doe 
5, or Jane Doe 7. Therefore, the District “shall not act upon any charges of 
unprofessional conduct” for Jane Doe 2, Jane Doe 4, Jane Doe 5, or Jane Doe 7. 
25. Nevertheless, the ASOC does not only allege unprofessional conduct, but 
based on the same facts, alleges additional grounds for dismissal (i.e., immoral 
conduct, evident unfitness, dishonesty, etc.) regarding all individuals with Jane Doe
designations. The lack of 45-day notice would not be a jurisdictional bar to those 
additional grounds. Consequently, Motion in Limine #4 was denied, and no evidence 
was excluded based on the asserted lack of notice regarding Jane Doe 2, Jane Doe 4, 
Jane Doe 5, and Jane 7, because the proven facts may give rise to grounds for 
dismissal which do not require the 45-day notice. 55 Causes for Dismissal
PERSISTENT VIOLATION OF REASONABLE REGULATIONS OF THE DISTRICT
26. Education Code section 44932, subdivision (a)(8), provides grounds for 
dismissal of a teacher based on “Persistent violation of or refusal to obey the school 
laws of the state or reasonable regulations prescribed for the government of the 
public schools by the state board or by the governing board of the school district 
employing him or her.” 
27. To dismiss a teacher under Education Code section 44932, subdivision 
(a)(8), for violations of law or school rules, the violations must be either “persistent” or 
“motivated by an attitude of continuous insubordination.” (
 (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 77, 81.) The word “persistent” 
has been interpreted to mean “stubborn” or “continuing or constant.” (
(1985) 174 
Cal.App.3d 1176, 1183; 
(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 77, 82 ( ).) Additionally, a single violation of a 
school board’s rules is insufficient cause for dismissal; it is the persistent disregard of 
school rules that the law is designed to regulate. ( , 28 Cal.App.3d at p. 84.)
28. In this case, Respondent engaged in the persistent violation of Board 
policies, including Board Policy BP4119.21 (with Jane Doe 4 and Jane Doe 5), Board 
Policy BP4119.24 (with Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and other students), and Board Policy 
BP 4030 (with Jane Doe 4 and Jane Doe 5.) 
29. Cause for dismissal of Respondent exists under Education Code section 
44932, subdivision (a)(8), based on his persistent violation of the reasonable 
regulations prescribed for the government of the public schools by the governing 56 board of the District. (Factual Findings 1 through 147; Legal Conclusions 15 through 
28.) 
WILLFUL REFUSAL TO PERFORM REGULAR ASSIGNMENTS  
30. Education Code section 44939 provides grounds for dismissal of a 
teacher based on “willful refusal to perform regular assignments without reasonable 
cause, as prescribed by reasonable rules and regulations of the employing school 
district.” 
31. To dismiss a teacher for “willful refusal to perform regular assignments 
without reasonable cause, as prescribed by reasonable rules and regulations of the 
employing school district,” the teacher’s refusal to perform his regular assignment 
must have been “willful.” In the context of a public employee’s insubordination or 
“willful” misconduct, the term insubordination “carries a volitional coloration which 
excludes the notion of accidental or even negligent conduct. . . [and] insubordination, 
equally with willful misconduct, requires proof of intent or willfulness. The latter 
elements imply that the person knows what he is doing and intends to do what he is 
doing.” ( . (1963) 215 Cal. App. 2d 770, 775.) 
Consequently, a willful refusal to perform a regular assignment must be more than an 
unsatisfactory, unprofessional, negligent, or even persistent failure to perform a 
regular assignment. Instead, it must be an intentional, volitional refusal to perform any 
part of a regular assignment. 
32. Although Respondent unreasonably left his students with an 
unsupervised student teacher numerous times per week for several months, the 
preponderance of the evidence failed to establish Respondent willfully left his class 
uncovered and intentionally refused to perform any part of his assignment. 57 33. No cause for dismissal of Respondent exists under Education Code 
section 44939, based on willful refusal to perform regular assignments without 
reasonable cause as prescribed by reasonable rules and regulations of the District. 
(Factual Findings 1 through 147; Legal Conclusions 30 through 32.) 
UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
34. Education Code section 44932, subdivision (a)(2), provides grounds for 
dismissal of a teacher based on unprofessional conduct.
35. "Unprofessional conduct" as used in Education Code section 44932, 
subdivision (a)(2), may be defined as conduct which violates the rules or ethical code 
of a profession or is such conduct that is unbecoming of a member of a profession in 
good standing. (  (1953) 41 Cal.2d 546, 553.) 
36. In this case, Respondent engaged in conduct unbecoming of a teacher in 
good standing when he exchanged inappropriate texts (including “Flirt”) with Jane Doe 
1 and allowed the text messaging to continue instead of taking steps a reasonable 
teacher should take to terminate the inappropriate contact. Additionally, Respondent’s 
dishonesty with District administrators when they asked about his interactions with 
Jane Doe 1 and his deceitful efforts to avoid detection of his misconduct, including 
deleting the text messages on his cellphone, constitute unprofessional conduct. 
37. Cause for dismissal of Respondent exists under Education Code section 
44932, subdivision (a)(2), based on unprofessional conduct with Jane Doe 1 and his 
dishonesty with the District. (Factual Findings 1 through 28, 113 through 138, 142, and 
144; Legal Conclusions 22 through 25, and 34 through 36.)58 DISHONESTY
38. Education Code section 44932, subdivision (a)(4), provides grounds for 
dismissal of a teacher based on dishonesty. 
39. Respondent was dishonest with District administrators when they asked 
about his interactions with Jane Doe 1. Respondent was also dishonest when he 
engaged in efforts to avoid detection of his misconduct, including deleting the text 
messages on his cellphone and asking Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and Jane Doe 3 to 
delete text messages from their cellphones. Respondent was also dishonest when he 
regularly left the SLOHS campus during paid work hours (preparation time and class 
time) for non-work-related reasons which he did not disclose to Mamo or the District.
40. Cause for dismissal of Respondent exists under Education Code section 
44932, subdivision (a)(3), based on dishonesty. (Factual Findings 1 through 147; Legal 
Conclusions 22 through 25, 38, and 39.) 
IMMORAL CONDUCT 
41. Education Code section 44932, subdivision (a)(1), provides grounds for 
dismissal of a teacher based on immoral conduct. 
42. “‘Immoral’ [conduct] has been defined generally as that which is hostile 
to the welfare of the general public and contrary to good morals. Immorality has not 
been confined to sexual matters, but includes conduct inconsistent with rectitude, or 
indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, dissoluteness; or as willful, flagrant, or 
shameless conduct showing moral indifference to the opinions of respectable 
members of the community, and as an inconsiderate attitude toward good order and 59 the public welfare.” (
(1960) 179 Cal. App.2d 808, 811 ( ).) 
43. “Immoral conduct” has been compared to moral turpitude, which “is 
sometimes used synonymously with ‘dishonesty’ or a high degree of unfairness.” 
( , 179 Cal.App.2d 808, 811.)
44. Respondent engaged in immoral conduct (i.e., conduct “showing moral 
indifference to the opinions of respectable members of the community,” and 
“inconsiderate attitude toward good order”) when he made highly inappropriate 
comments about female students’ bodies in his classroom, when he asked Jane Doe 4 
about being sexually active, and when he regularly left campus during paid work hours 
to engage in a sexual affair with a student’s mother. Respondent further engaged in 
immoral conduct (i.e., dishonesty) when: he was dishonest with District administrators 
about his interactions with Jane Doe 1; he engaged in efforts to avoid detection of his 
misconduct, including deleting the text messages on his cellphone and asking Jane 
Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and Jane Doe 3 to delete text messages from their cellphones; and 
he regularly left the SLOHS campus during paid work hours (preparation time and 
class time) for non-work-related reasons which he did not disclose to the District.
45. Cause for dismissal of Respondent exists under Education Code section 
44932, subdivision (a)(1), based on immoral conduct. (Factual Findings 1 through 147; 
Legal Conclusions 15 through 25, 41 through 44.) 
ANALYSIS OF RESPONDENT ’S FITNESS TO TEACH 
46. In order to dismiss a teacher for immoral conduct, unprofessional 
conduct, or dishonesty, the teacher’s conduct must indicate the teacher is unfit to 
teach. ( (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214 (immoral conduct 60 must indicate an unfitness to teach); (1983) 
149 Cal.App.3d 1167, 1174 (unprofessional conduct must also indicate an unfitness to 
teach);  (1988) 45 Cal.3d 208, 220, fn. 12 
(dishonesty must also indicate a teacher’s unfitness to teach).) 
47. The Commission has broad discretion to determine what constitutes 
unfitness to teach. ( (1999) 20 Cal.4th 
327.)
48. In analyzing fitness to teach, it must be kept in mind that a teacher is 
regarded as a role model for students, as noted by several courts:
“The calling (of a teacher) is so intimate, its duties so 
delicate, the things in which a teacher might prove 
unworthy or would fail are so numerous that they are 
incapable of enumeration in any legislative enactment. His
habits, his speech, his good name, his cleanliness, the 
wisdom and propriety of his unofficial utterances, his
associations, all are involved. His ability to inspire children 
and to govern them, his power as a teacher, and the 
character for which he stands are matters of major concern 
in a teacher’s selection and retention.” (
, 179 Cal.App.2d 808, [. . .] citing from 
, 66 Cal.App.157, 168[.])
There are certain professions which impose upon persons 
attracted to them responsibilities and limitations on 
freedom of action which do not exist in regard to other 61 callings. Public officials such as judges, policemen and 
schoolteachers fall into such a category. 
As between a teacher and his student, “(a)n important part 
of the education . . . is the instilling of a proper respect for 
authority and obedience to necessary discipline. Lessons are 
learned from example as well as from precept.” (
., 19 Cal.App.2d 405, 408, 65 P.2d 912.) And 
as our Supreme Court said in , 
41 Cal.2d 546, at 552 [. . .], “A teacher . . . in the public 
school system is regarded by the public and pupils in the 
light of an examplar, whose words and actions are likely to 
be followed by the (students) coming under his care and 
protection.” 
( (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 820, 824-825; 
(2011) 194 
Cal.App.4th 1454, 1463-1464.) 
49. As set forth in (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214 
( ), a teacher’s conduct cannot be abstractly characterized as “immoral,” or 
“unprofessional,” thus warranting discipline, “unless that conduct indicates that 
[Respondent] is unfit to teach.” ( . at 229.) enumerates eight criteria for 
analysis of whether a teacher is unfit to teach. Not all  factors must be met for 
the test to be satisfied. ( (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 369.) 
It is sufficient when the most pertinent  factors have been considered. (
(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1766, 
1777.) Moreover, the analysis need not be conducted on each individual fact 62 established, but rather can be applied to the accumulated facts established 
collectively. (
(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1429, 1457.)
50. As set forth below, the criteria are applied to the case at hand, 
addressing immoral conduct, unprofessional conduct, and dishonesty as grounds for 
dismissal. 
51. The first factor enumerated by is “the likelihood that the 
conduct may have adversely affected students, fellow teachers, or the educational 
community, and the degree of such adversity anticipated.” ( , 1 Cal.3d 
at p. 229.) In this case, Respondent’s misconduct had adverse emotional impacts on 
several students, on District staff, and the school community. Respondent developed a 
negative on-campus and community standing affecting his fitness for service as a 
teacher. Additionally, Respondent’s dishonesty had an adverse impact on his 
relationship with District administration, thereby fostering a lack of trust and 
confidence in him, and thus rendering him unfit for service as a teacher.
52. The second factor enumerated by is “the proximity or 
remoteness in time of the conduct.” ( , 1 Cal.3d at p. 229.) Respondent’s 
misconduct with Jane Doe 4 and Jane Doe 5 occurred during the 2019-2020 school 
year. He continued to engage in misconduct through October 2022, including making 
inappropriate comments about female students’ bodies; regularly leaving campus 
during paid work hours for non-work-related reasons, which he did not disclose to the 
District; inappropriate texting with Jane Doe 1; dishonesty with District administrators 
about his interactions with Jane Doe 1 and engaging in efforts to avoid detection of 
his misconduct by deleting the text messages on his cellphone and asking Jane Doe 1, 
Jane Doe 2, and Jane Doe 3 to delete text messages from their cellphones. 63 Respondent’s misconduct occurred almost continuously for several years until at least 
October 2022, and is therefore proximate in time. Respondent continued his 
dishonesty throughout his testimony at this administrative proceeding, thus further 
demonstrating his unfitness to serve as a teacher. 
53. The third factor enumerated by is “the type of credential held 
by the person involved.” ( , 1 Cal.3d at p. 229.) Respondent holds a 
credential authorizing him to teach grades 9 through 12. Respondent’s credential 
provides him the ability to exert influence over and act as a role model for teenagers. 
Respondent’s credential also provides him with the chance to interact with female 
students and female co-workers. Respondent’s proven misconduct and unprofessional 
interactions with female students and staff demonstrate his unfitness to teach using 
the credential he holds. The type of credential held by Respondent is inapplicable to 
the analysis of whether his dishonesty renders him unfit to teach. However, dishonesty 
is an undesirable trait for any teacher, regardless of the credential held. 
54. The fourth factor enumerated by is “the extenuating or 
aggravating circumstances surrounding the conduct.” ( , 1 Cal.3d at p. 
229.) In this case, there are no extenuating circumstances for Respondent’s 
misconduct. However, in aggravation: (1) Respondent regularly left campus during 
paid work hours to engage in a sexual affair with a student’s mother (Jane Doe 7) 
whom he met after viewing her Instagram account in class and asking her daughter 
(Jane Doe 2) for her phone number; (2) Respondent continued to regularly leave 
campus during paid work hours to engage in his sexual relationship with a student’s 
mother after being counseled by administrators; (3) Respondent engaged in his 
inappropriate conduct despite his years of teaching experience and training to the 
contrary; (4) Respondent sought to cover up his misconduct with Jane Doe 1, deleting 64 all text messages, and enlisting Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and Jane Doe 3 in the cover-
up; and (5) Respondent affirmed his prior falsehoods during testimony, compounding 
his prior deceitfulness with additional duplicity under oath. These aggravating 
circumstances support a finding that Respondent is unfit to teach. 
55. The fifth factor enumerated by is “the praiseworthiness or 
blameworthiness of the motives resulting in the conduct.” ( , 1 Cal.3d at 
p. 229.) There is nothing praiseworthy about Respondent’s conduct. Respondent’s 
conduct can only be viewed as blameworthy. Respondent sought to engage in 
unprofessional and improper communications and interactions with female co-workers 
and students, and he regularly left campus during paid work hours to have a sexual 
relationship with his student’s mother. There is also nothing praiseworthy about 
Respondent’s dishonesty. Instead, Respondent’s self-serving motivation for his
dishonesty is obviously blameworthy. The foregoing supports a finding that 
Respondent is unfit to teach. 
56. The sixth factor enumerated by is “the likelihood of the 
reoccurrence of the questioned conduct.” ( , 1 Cal.3d at p. 229.) In this 
case, Respondent ceased texting Jane Doe 1 after their inappropriate text messaging
came to light. However, Respondent has an extended history of seeking female 
attention (from Jane Doe 4, Jane Doe 5, Jane Doe 7, Jane Doe 2, and Jane Doe 1), 
despite knowing the impropriety of his actions. Respondent also continued his sexual 
relationship with Jane Doe 7 during paid work hours despite being called into a 
meeting with the vice principal to address his leaving campus and despite his 
knowledge of the indiscretion of this behavior (e.g., his text to Jane Doe 7, “Me leaving 
work isn’t actually ok”). Given Respondent’s continual misconduct over several years 
despite possible negative repercussions, and given Respondent’s efforts to cover up 65 his wrongdoing, there is a significant possibility of recurrence of misconduct. 
Additionally, Respondent continued his dishonesty from Fall 2022 (with District 
administrators) through his misleading testimony to the Commission at hearing. 
Respondent’s steadfast adherence to falsehoods, even while under oath and faced 
with contrary evidence, demonstrated his propensity for deceit and tainted his entire 
testimony such that virtually none of his statements were reliable. Consequently, 
Respondent’s deceitfulness is likely to recur. The foregoing likelihood of recurrence of 
Respondent’s misconduct and dishonesty supports a finding that Respondent is unfit 
to teach. 
57. The seventh factor enumerated by is “the extent to which 
disciplinary action may inflict an adverse impact or chilling effect upon the 
constitutional rights of the teacher involved or other teachers.” ( , 1 
Cal.3d at p. 229.) In this case, there is no evidence that disciplinary action would inflict 
an adverse impact or chilling effect on Respondent’s or other teachers’ constitutional 
rights. No case law was presented to establish a teacher has the constitutional right to 
engage in inappropriate comments in class, unacceptable texting with a teenage 
student, or unwanted communications with co-workers, or to leave campus during 
paid work hours to engage in a sexual relationship with a student’s mother. No 
authority was presented to establish a teacher has a constitutional right to be 
dishonest with his employing District, and then to continue his deceitfulness under 
oath. Moreover, teachers fall within a class of professions “which impose upon persons 
attracted to them, responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which do not 
exist in regard to other callings.” ( 16 Cal.App.3d 820, 
824-825; , 
94 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1463-1464.) Consequently, there is no constitutional concern to 66 weigh against the imposition of discipline for Respondent’s misconduct and 
dishonesty. 
58. The last factor enumerated by is “the publicity or notoriety 
given to the conduct.” ( , 1 Cal.3d at p. 229.) As noted by the Court in 
, , 16 Cal.App.3d at p. 826, a teacher may be 
discharged where his conduct “has gained sufficient notoriety so as to impair his on-
campus relationships.” In this case, the publicity and notoriety given to Respondent’s 
misconduct has been significant, and it has negatively impacted his on-campus 
relationships with District staff and with students. Given the publicity and notoriety of 
this case, the impairment to Respondent’s relationships with his students and 
colleagues will likely continue. The foregoing supports a finding that Respondent has 
been rendered unfit for service as a teacher. 
59. Analysis of Respondent’s conduct applying the criteria 
establishes Respondent’s unfitness to teach. (Factual Findings 1 through 154; Legal 
Conclusions 46 through 58.) 
EVIDENT UNFITNESS FOR SERVICE 
60. Education Code section 44932, subdivision (a)(6), provides grounds for 
dismissal of a teacher based on evident unfitness for service. 
61. “Evident unfitness for service” as used in Education Code section 44932, 
subdivision (a)(6), has been defined by the Court in 
(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1429, 1444-
1446, as follows:67 “Evident unfitness for service” . . . means “clearly not fit, not 
adapted to[,] or unsuitable for teaching, ordinarily by 
reason of temperamental defects or inadequacies.” 
[Footnote.] Unlike “unprofessional conduct,” “evident 
unfitness for service” connotes a fixed character trait, 
presumably not remediable merely on receipt of notice that 
one’s conduct fails to meet the expectations of the 
employing school district. [¶] . . . [¶] 
Our conclusion does not mean that the criteria for unfitness 
set out in . . . may be 
disregarded where “evident unfitness for service” is at issue. 
These criteria must be analyzed to determine, as a threshold 
matter, whether the cited conduct indicates unfitness for 
service. ( (1977) 19 Cal.3d 691, 
696.) If the criteria are satisfied, the next step is to 
determine whether the “unfitness” is “evident”; i.e., whether 
the offensive conduct is caused by a defect in temperament. 
62. In this case, Respondent engaged in misconduct over several years. He
texted female coworkers after work hours with unwanted requests to meet at, or to 
pick him up from, bars at night. Respondent’s colleagues describe him as flirtatious, 
apparently liking “the chase,” and seemingly seeking an extra-marital affair. 
Respondent later obtained Jane Doe 7’s phone number from her daughter during 
Respondent’s class time when he was looking at Jane Doe 7’s Instagram account. For 
several months, Respondent regularly left campus during paid work hours to engage 
in a sexual relationship with his student’s mother. In addition to indiscrete actions with 68 adults, Respondent engaged in unacceptable interactions with students. His
inappropriate comments and conduct with students allowed them to feel they could 
text him inappropriately. Several students described Respondent as someone who 
sought to be the “cool teacher” and “one their friends,” without the required 
demarcation and necessary differentiation as an adult and their teacher. 
63. Respondent demonstrated a lack of judgment and a lack of discretion by 
engaging in a pattern of inappropriate interactions with female colleagues and 
students despite knowing the impropriety of his actions and the risk of negative 
repercussions. In addition to his poor judgment and lack of discretion, Respondent 
demonstrated an inability to accept responsibility for his actions and a propensity for 
dishonesty during the District’s investigation and continuing throughout his 
falsehoods under oath. Respondent’s enduring misconduct and deceit apparently arise 
from fixed defects in temperament or character which are not remediable. Since 
teachers are expected to demonstrate good judgment, honesty, and trustworthiness, 
Respondent’s character defects demonstrate his “evident unfitness for service.” 
64. Cause for dismissal of Respondent exists under Education Code section 
44932, subdivision (a)(6), based on evident unfitness for service. (Factual Findings 1 
through 154; Legal Conclusions 46 through 63.) 
Disposition 
65. While grounds for dismissal exist, the Commission retains discretion to 
determine whether dismissal is the appropriate sanction. (
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 327, 343-344.) 
66. The District established several causes for Respondent’s dismissal from 
employment, most significantly his evident unfitness for service. Respondent’s defects 69in temperament, including his lack of judgment and his enduring propensity for 
dishonesty, will continue to impede him from being a trusted teacher, a role model for 
students, and a respected colleague. Consequently, dismissal is the appropriate 
sanction.
