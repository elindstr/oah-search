BEFORE  THE 
COMMISSION  ON  PROFESSIONAL  COMPETENCE 
STATE  OF  CALIFORNIA 

In  the  Matter  of  the  Accusation  Against: 

OAH  Case  No.  2014100674.1 

ARLENE  SCHERY, 

Respondent. 

  

DECISION  AFTER  REMAND 

The  Commission  on  Professional  Competence  (Commission)  heard  the  above- 

captioned  matter  in  Los  Angeles  on  November  2,  3,  5,  6,  9,  10,  and  12,  2015.  The 
Commission  members  were  John  Davis,  Andrea  Adauto,  and  Joseph  D.  Montoya, 
Administrative  Law  Judge  (ALJ),  Office  of  Administrative  Hearings  (OAH).  Complainant 
was  represented  by  Michelle  M.  Goldsmith,  Bergman  Dacey  Goldsmith,  and  Susan  E. 
Hyman,  Assistant  General  Counsel,  Los  Angeles  Unified  School  District  (LAUSD  or 
District).  Respondent  Arlene  Schery  appeared  with  her  attorney,  Ronald  C.  Lapekis. 

At  the  end  of  the  hearing  Complainant  moved  to  amend  the  First  Amended 
Accusation  (FAA),  which  motion  was  granted.  The  amendments,  described  below,  were 
interlineated  into  the  FAA,  exhibit  21,  as  follows: 

At  page  2,  line  6,  paragraph  1,  the  words  “on  or  about  May  14,  2009,”  were  inserted 

in  place  of  the  words  “in  or  about  the  2008-2009  school  year.” 

At  page  2,  line  9,  paragraph  2,  the  words  “on  or  about  May  14,  2009,”  were  inserted 

in  place  of  the  words  “in  or  about  the  2008-2009  school  year.” 

At  page  2,  line  20,  paragraph  5,  the  word  “Alexandria”  was  changed  to  “Alexandra,” 

and  on  that  same  line  the  word  “Summer”  was  changed  to  “Sommer.” 

At  page  2,  line  25,  the  paragraph  was  designated  as  paragraph  6c,  and  the  first  words 

were  changed  to  read  “Said,  ‘Need  an  oil  change?’.” 

At  page  2,  line  27,  the  subparagraph  designation  was  changed  from  “c”  to  “d.”

The  matter  was  submitted  for  decision  on  November  12,  2015.  The  Commission 

issued  its  decision  on  February  12,  2016.  Thereafter  the  parties  instituted  proceedings  in  the 
Superior  Court  of  California,  County  of  Los  Angeles,  each  seeking  a  writ  of  mandate.  (Los 
Angeles  Unified  School  District  v.  Commission  on  Professional  Competence,  et  al.  (Super. 
Ct.  L.A.  County,  2016,  BS  161753.) 

On  July  10,  2017,  the  Honorable  Mary  H.  Strobel,  Judge  of  the  Superior  Court,  issued 
a  Writ  of  Mandate  to  the  Commission,  ordering  it  to  make  additional  findings  concerning  the 
Commission’s  Legal  Conclusion  number  10  relating  to  immoral  conduct,  in  conformity  with 
Topanga  Assn.  for  a  Scenic  Community  v.  County  of Los  Angeles  (1974)  11  Cal.3d  506,  514- 
515. 

On  August  7,  2017,  the  Commission  met  and  deliberated  further,  in  compliance  with 
the  writ  of  mandate.  The  Commission  hereby  makes  its  factual  findings,  legal  conclusions, 
and  order  following  the  remand.  This  includes  a  new  Factual  Finding  20,  and  new  Legal 
Conclusion  10. 

INTRODUCTION  AND  STATEMENT  OF  THE  CASE 

In  this  proceeding  the  District  took  steps  to  terminate  Respondent,  and  she  demanded 

a  hearing  on  the  matter.  Four  statutory  grounds  were  asserted  as  justifying  termination: 
unprofessional  conduct  (Ed.  Code,  §  44932,  subd.  (a)(1));  immoral  conduct  (Ed.  Code,  §§ 
44932,  subd.  (a)(1)  &  44939);  evident  unfitness  for  service  (Ed.  Code  §  44932,  subd.  (a)(5)); 
and,  persistent  violation  of  state  laws  or  regulations,  or  the  district’s  regulations,  for  the 
governance  of  schools  (§44932,  subd.  (a)(7)).  | 

It  was  alleged  that  on  several  occasions  Respondent  treated  students  in  a  demeaning 

and  insulting  way.  It  was  also  alleged  that  Respondent  violated  her  school’s  cell  phone 
policy  on  more  than  one  occasion,  despite  written  warnings  to  comply. 

Respondent  provided  evidence  regarding  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  events 
referenced  in  the  FAA,  and  otherwise  provided  evidence  in  support  of  her  retention  by  the 
District.  However,  the  District  proved  the  vast  majority  of  the  allegations  against 
Respondent,  and  the  Commission  finds  and  concludes,  unanimously,  that  cause  for 
termination  has  been  established.

The  Parties  and  Jurisdiction 

FACTUAL  FINDINGS 

1. 

Complainant  Justo  H.  Avila  executed  the  Accusation  and  the  FAA  while 

acting  in  his  official  capacity  as  Chief  Human  Resources  Officer  of  the  District. 

2, 

The  District  commenced  this  proceeding  on  April  26,  2013,  when  Vivian  K. 
Ekchian  executed  a  Statement  of  Charges  against  Respondent.  That  Statement  of  Charges 
was  filed  with  the  District's  governing  board,  which  thereafter  voted  to  terminate 
Respondent. 

Be 

On  May  14,  2013,  the  District  gave  Respondent  written  notice  of  its  intent  to 
terminate  her,  and  served  Respondent  with  a  copy  of  the  Statement  of  Charges.  Respondent 
made  a  timely  request  for  hearing,  which  led  to  the  issuance  of  the  Accusation.  She  then 
filed  a  Notice  of  Defense,  and  this  proceeding  ensued.  On  October  23,  2015,  ALJ  Michael 
Scarlett  granted  the  District’s  motion  to  file  an  amended  accusation.  By  operation of law, 
Respondent  is  deemed  to  have  denied  the  allegations  of  the  FAA.  All  jurisdictional 
requirements  have  been  met. 

4. 

Respondent  is  a  certificated  teacher  employed  by  the  District,  and  at  the  times 

relevant  to  this  decision  was  teaching  history  and  anthropology  to  high  school  students. 
Respondent  holds  a  clear  single  subject  teaching  credential,  with  a  social  studies 
authorization.  She  also  holds  a  Cross-cultural,  Language  and  Academic  Development 
credential  (CLAD).  During  the  time  relevant  to  this  proceeding—May  14,  2009,  to  October 
25,  2012—Respondent  was  assigned  to  teach  at  Eagle  Rock  High  School. 

Findings  on the  Allegations of the  FAA? 

5. 

(A)  It  was  established  that  during  the  period  between  May  14,  2009,  and  May 

28,  2009,  Respondent  treated  her  student,  CIB...  in  a  derogatory  manner  and  a 
demeaning  manner.  Respondent  referred  to  the  student  as  being  “dumb.”  Respondent  would 
mispronounce  the  student’s  name  and  when  the  student  would  explain  how  to  pronounce  her 
name  correctly,  Respondent  would  make  no  real  effort  to  get  the  name  right.  Instead,  she 
would  repeat  the  name,  improperly  in  two  or  three  ways,  and  then  say  “whatever.”  This 
showed  both  disrespect  to  the  student  and  an  unprofessional  attitude. 

(B)  Respondent’s  failure  to  make  a  real  attempt  to  learn  how  to  say  her 

student’s  name  properly  is  juxtaposed  to  her  efforts  to  teach  CH 
words  properly.  C 
primary  language  was  not  English,  but  Spanish.  When  the  student  would  give  presentations, 
she  would  mispronounce  some  words,  and  Respondent  would  correct  her  pronunciation  in 
The  Commission 
front  of  the  whole  class,  who  often  laughed,  to  the  discomfort  of  CH 

pronounce  certain 
as  an  ESL  (English  as  a  Second  Language)  student,  one  whose 

° 

As  amended  at  the  end  of  the  hearing

recognizes  that  Respondent  should  teach  her  students  in  a  way  that  expands  their  vocabulary, 
and  that  correcting  pronunciation  is  not  unprofessional  in  and  of  itself.  However,  the 
evidence  indicates  that  Respondent  went  about  the  task  in  an  insensitive  way  that  exposed 
Cio  ridicule,  while  she  herself  was  not  exposed  to  ridicule  for  mispronouncing  the 
student’s  name. 

6. 

During  the  period  after  May  14,  2009,  and  through  the  end  of  the  2009  school 

year,  Respondent  made  disparaging  remarks  about  people  who  speak  Spanish,  and  about 
Mexicans.  She  did  this  in  class,  and  her  classes  had  many  students  who  were  of  Mexican  or 
other  Hispanic  descent.  She  also  referred  to  a  neighborhood  where  some  of  the  students 
lived,  and  which  was  known  to  have  gang  elements,  in  a  way  that  painted  all  of  her  students 
as  involved  in  gangs. 

7. 

(A)  On  or  about  October  12,  2012,  Respondent  confiscated  a  cell  phone  from 
one  of  her  students,  AlNO.,  because  he  was  violating  the  Eagle  Rock  High  School  Cell 
Phone  Policy  (Phone  Policy).  The  Phone  Policy  essentially  forbade  students  from  using  cell 
phones  during  the  school  day. 

(B)  Teachers  who  confiscated  cell  phones  were,  required  to  turn  the  devices 
over  to  the  Dean  before  the  end  of  the  day,  because  the  students  were  authorized  to  retrieve 
their  confiscated  cell  phones  at  the  end  of  the  day,  if  they  were  accompanied  by a  parent.  If 
the  Dean  was  unavailable,  the  phone  could  be  left  at  the  administration  office,  as  it  was  open 
until  4:30,  and  there  was  a  place  to  secure  the  phone  at  that  office. 

(D)  On  three  occasions  between  November  20,  2009  and  June  6,  2012, 
Respondent  had  been  reminded,  in  writing,  that  confiscated  phones  or  other  electronic 
devices  had  to  be  turned  in  the  day  they  were  confiscated. 

(D)  Respondent  did  not  turn  the  phone  over  to  the  Dean,  or  the  administration 
office,  on  October  12,  2012.  Instead,  she  took  it  home;  despite  knowledge  of  her  obligations, 
thereby  failing  to  follow  policy  and  directives  previously  given  to  her.  Her  excuse  was  that 
she  could  not  find  the  Dean  in  his  office,  and  that  her  work  day  was  over  at  3:07  p.m.,  and 
that  she  was  entitled,  under  the  union  contract  to  go  straight  home,  and  she  was  not 
obligated,  after  school,  to  locate  the  Dean,  or  otherwise  take  steps  to  turn  the  phone  in.  This 
ignores  the  fact  that  she  could  have  taken  the  phone  to  the  administration  office  on  her  way 
out  of  school,  which  would  have  secured  the  phone  but  left  it  accessible  to  the  Dean  or 
another  administrator  if  the  student  and  their  parent  came  to  retrieve  the  phone. 

8. 

(A)  In  approximately  September  2012,  Respondent  directed  a  student  named 

©  tape  a  picture  of  a  creature  that  looked  Jike  a  monkey  or  an  ape  onto  the  chest  of 
another  student,  Mil  Respondent  then  told Mio  come  to  the  front  of  the  room,  which 
he  refused  to  do. 

Hf

(B)  The  picture  in  question  was,  according  to  Respondent,  an  artist’s  likeness 

of  “Lucy,”  considered  to  be  the  oldest  hominid,  and  precursor  in  the  evolutionary  chain,  to 
humans.  However,  to  a  casual  observer,  it  would  appear  to  be  a  picture  of  some  sort  of  ape. 

was  a  picture  of 

(C)  Atsome  point  during  the  interaction,  Respondent  stated  that  the  picture 
Mid  other  students  took  this  to  be  Respondent  making  fun  of 
who  is  somewhat  hairy,  with  heavy  eyebrows,  and  who,  as  a  child,  was  sensitive  to 

being  “hairy.” 

(D)  By  telling Mao  come  to  the  front  of  the  room,  Respondent  intended  to 

make  him  the  butt  of  some  joke  she  had  in  mind.  That  he  would  not  go  to  the  front  of  the 
room  indicates  he  perceived  he  was  to  be  made  the  butt  of  her  joke.  Respondent’s  conduct 
was  demeaning  to Mina  was  perceived  that  way  by  other  students.” 

9. 

(A)  On  October  25,2012,  Respondent  discussed  confidential  information 

pertaining  to  her  student ABBE  with  the  another  student,  and  the  other  student’s  mother. 
It  was  improper  for  her  to  do  so. 

(B)  The  discussion  took  place  during  a  student-led  parent  teacher  conference 
that  took  place  in  Respondent’s  classroom  on  the  evening  of  October  25,  2012.  Respondent 
was  meeting  with  her  student,  K.S.,  and  the  student’s  mother  (Mom).  At  some  point  during 
the  conference,  Mom  told  Respondent  that  her  daughter’s  grades  had  been  declining,  and  she 
asked  Respondent  if  she  could  explain  the  drop  in  performance.  Respondent  replied  that  the 
daughter,  K.S.,  was  hanging  around  with  the  wrong  friends,  and  then  named  As 
the  negative  influence  on  K.S.  Respondent  told  Mom  that ARE  us:  wanted  to  fool 
around,  and  that  she  had  demonstrated  behavioral  issues  around  school. 

(C)  At  some  point  during  this  conversation,  Respondent  discussed 

ARE  ;  grades  with  K.S.  and  Mom.  Mom  and  her  daughter  both  testified  in  a  credible 
;  grades  in  Respondent’s  history  class, 

manner,  that  Respondent  told  them  about  AR 
and  Respondent  told  them  about  A:  Spanish  class.

KS.  told  Aj 

Mom  told  K.S. 

of  her  mother’s

10. 

(A)  On  October  24,  2012,  Respondent  engaged  in  assaultive  and  abusive 

behavior  toward  a  student,  known  as 
teacher.  The  facts  and  circumstances  follow. 

“7  when  7a  was  sent  to  her  classroom  by  another 

(B)  On  the  day  in  question,  Zona AB 

(:cferenced  in  Factual  Finding 
9),  were  brought  to  Respondent’s  classroom  by  Mr.  Dominguez,  who  taught  the  two  students 
Spanish  in  a  nearby  classroom.  Dominguez  asked  Respondent  if  the  two  students  could  be 
placed  in  her  room  for  awhile,  as  they  were  acting  up  in  the  Spanish  class.  Mr.  Dominguez 
said  he  had  some  work  that  the  two  students  could  do.  Respondent  agreed  with  Dominguez’s 
request. 

(C)  While  discussing  the  matter,  Dominguez  said  of  Zina  the  student  was 
up,  and  that  he  had  the  devil  in  him,  or  words  to  that  effect.  Respondent  told  Aina 

acting 
A  kee  to  sit,  which  was  in  desks  near  the  back  right  section  of  the  classroom. 

(D)  Respondent  went  to  the  back  of  the  room  near  7nd  splashed  or  poured 
some  water  on  him,  and  sprayed  him  with  a  spray  bottle  labeled  as  whiteboard  cleaner.  She 
said  words  to  the  effect  that  the  water  was  to  get  the  devil  out  of  him,  implying  some  sort  of 
exorcism  needed  to  take  place. 

(E)  Zs  surprised  and  shocked  by  Respondent’s  conduct.  An  exchange 

followed,  and  during  the  course  of  that  exchange  Respondent  told Zito  get  his  finger  out  of 
his  ass.° 

(F)  At  another  point  during  the  exchange,  Respondent  held  a  metal  rod,  at 

times  during  the  proceeding  described  as  a  dipstick  for  an  automobile  engine,  and  said  it  was 
for  checking  Zs  oil,  and  moved  the  stick  up  and  down  in  a  gesture  perceived  as  obscene 
by Zi 

(G)  7a  who  is  openly  gay,  perceived  that  Respondent  was  attacking  him  on 

that  point.  He  made  a  complaint  to  the  school  administration  before  the  day  was  out. 

(H)_The  interchange  was  witnessed  by  several  students.  One  of  them,  S| 
later  described  Zffas  “that  poor  guy”  who  “looked  like  he  was  in  shock.”  He  went  on  to  say 
“that  poor  guy  [ZJ  just  looked  freaked  by  the  time  he  left  the  class.”  (Ex.  41,  pp.  2-3.) 

“  The  student’s  first  and  middle  name  was  im  and  he  went  by  the  name 

|  Some  of  the  students  knew  him  as Ri  (See  ex.  41,  p.  3.) 

5  Respondent  told  a  police  officer,  when  interviewed  by  him  the  next  day,  that  she 

told Zito  get  his  head  out  of  his  ass  and  to  get  some  work  done.  That  version  of  the  event  is 
not  credited  by  the  Commission,  but  is  a  tacit  admission  of  improper  conduct.  She  also 
attacked  “7m:  credibility,  claiming  he  had  a  chip  on  his  shoulder.  (Ex.  41,  p.  3.) 

6

11. 

The  District  established  that  Respondent  had,  during  the  relevant  time  period, 
received  direction  and  counseling  regarding  her  behaviors.  The  District  has  had  policies  in 
place  that  governed  the  actions  of  permanent  teachers  such  as  Respondent,  and  Respondent 
had  notice  of  those  policies.  Those  policies  proscribed  Respondent’s  misconduct. 

12. 

(A)  On  May  29,  2009,  following  the  events  involving  ei  Respondent 

had  a  conference  with  an  assistant  principal  that  dealt,  in  part,  with  the  events  regarding  that 
student.  Respondent  received  a  memo  regarding  the  conference.  That  memo  cited 
provisions  of  the  California  Standards  for  the  Teaching  Profession  (Cal.  Standards),  the 
LAUSD  Code  of  Conduct  (Conduct  Code),  LAUSD  Code  of  Ethics  (Ethics  Code),  and  the 
LAUSD  Respectful  Treatment  of  All  Others  Policy  (Respect  Policy). 

(B)  According  to  the  memo,  Cal.  Standards  sections  2.2,  2.3,  and  2.4  were 
discussed  with  Respondent.  Also  discussed  was  the  Conduct  Code,  numbers  3  and  5,  the 
Ethics  Code,  wherein  it  is  stated  teachers  must  treat  students  with  respect,  as  well  as  similar 
provisions  of  the  Respect  Policy. 

(C)  Copies  of  the  Conduct  Code,  Cal.  Standards,  Ethics  Code,  and Respect 
Policy  were  transmitted  to  Respondent  along  with  a  copy  of  the  memo  issued  after  the  May 
28,  2009  meeting. 

13. 

(A)  At  the  beginning  of  every  school  year,  all  the  teachers  at  Eagle  Rock  High 

School  received  a  number  of  documents  that  set  out  District  policies  and  procedures.  In  the 
school  years  2010-2011,  2011-2012,  and  2012-2013,  Respondent  received  copies  of  such 
documents  at  the  beginning  of  each  school  year. 

(B)  The  documents  received  by  Respondent  at  the  beginning  of  each  school 

year  included  the  District’s  Code  of  Conduct  with  Students,  Conduct  Code,  Ethics  Code,  Cal. 
Standards,  and  the  School  Board’s  Resolution  pertaining  to  the  respectful  treatment  of  all 
persons. 

(C)  The  aforementioned  documents  put  Respondent  on  notice  of  what  she 

should  know  in  any  event:  that  conduct  tending  to  insult  or  demean  students  was  improper. 

14. 

During  the  hearing  Respondent  stated  she  had  never  read  the  Ethics  Code.  It 
is  inferred  she  had  not  read  the  other  policy  materials  that  had  been  transmitted  to  her  on  a 
yearly  basis. 

Other  Matters 

15. 

(A)  Zfdid  not  testify  at  the  hearing  because  he  now  resides  in  Arizona, 

beyond  the  reach  of  a  subpoena.  He  was  deposed  by  both  parties  in  June  2015.  Respondent 
argued  that  the  credibility  of  his  testimony  should  be  scrutinized  in  light  of  the  many  times 
he  claimed,  while  being  examined  by  Respondent’s  counsel,  not  to  recall  something.

(B)  As  noted  in  the  Legal  Conclusions  below,  discerning  a  witness’s 

credibility  from  a  cold  transcript  is  problematic.  4s  nearly  complete  refusal  to  answer 
questions  put  to  him  by  Respondent’s  counsel,  following  a  barrage  of  objections  by  District’s 
counsel  has  harmed,  but  not  destroyed,  Zs  credibility  regarding  the  incident  in  October 
2012.  However,  the  bulk  of  his  claims  were  corroborated  by  other  witnesses  and 
contemporaneous  statements.  In  this  regard,  the  statements  by  Sto  the  police  the  next 
day,  memorialized  in  exhibit  41,  supported  the  findings  made  on  the  incident  with  7 

16. 

Respondent’s  credibility  suffered  during  her  testimony,  in  that  she  herself  had 
memory  lapses,  and  sometimes  had  a  truculent  demeanor  during  cross  examination.  Further, 
testimony  she  gave  in  a  deposition  taken  in  connection  with  this  proceeding,  a  deposition 
taken  in  connection  with  her  workers’  compensation  claim  against  the  District,  and  testimony 
during  a  workers’  compensation  hearing,  provided  inconsistent  positions  on  some  of  the  key 
events.  And,  Respondent  had  made  some  damning  admissions.  As  noted  above,  when 
questioned  by  police  the  day  after  the  incident  with  ZJJ  she  denied  telling  him  to  get  a  digit 
out  of  his  ass,  instead  saying  she  told  Ao  get  his  head  out  of  his  ass.  During  the 
conference  in  May  2009,  where  her  attitude  toward  Hispanic  students  was  questioned,  she 
said  “you  get  called  a  racist  all  the  time.  Doesn’t  everyone?”  (Ex.  32,  p.  105.) 

17. 

Respondent  attempted  to  make  these  issues  of  her  conduct  into  a  case  against 
the  way  the  District  is  administered,  and  not  about  her  behavior.  At  times  she  claimed  that 
she  was  being  let  go  because  the  District  wants  to  fire  its  higher-paid  teachers.  There  was  no 
evidence  she  is  among  the  highest  paid  teachers,  nor  was  there  a  hint  of  such  a  motive  on  the 
District’s  part.  When  she  received  the  Notice  of  Unsatisfactory  Acts  and  Notice  of 
Suspension  in  January  2013,  she  stated  that  the  principal  and  other  administrators  in  the 
District  were  acting  like  Nazis, 
been  doing  when  they  were  brought  to  justice  at  Nuremberg  after  the  Second  World  War. 
Such  pernicious  insults  had  no  justification. 
retaliation  that  went  unsupported. 

“just  following  orders”  like  the  senior  Nazis  claimed  they  had 

She  has  made  claims  of  sexual  harassment  and 

  

  

18. 

The  record  establishes  that  Respondent  was  counseled,  informally  and 

formally,  that  she  had  to  watch  her  behavior  and  guard  against  making  hurtful  statements. 
The  former  principal  at  Eagle  Rock  High  School  testified  that  Respondent  made  hurtful 
comments  about  his  accent,  and  he  tried  to  get  her  to  understand  that  she  was  being 
inappropriate.  Other  supervisors  testified  to  hearing  occasional  complaints  from  students 
that  Respondent  was  saying  inappropriate  things  in  class,  often  with  racial  overtones  or 
making  statements  that  were  demeaning  of  some  of  the  students.  Those  supervisors 
counseled  Respondent  to  take  care  not  to  act  in  an  offensive  manner.  Respondent  failed  to 
heed  those  warnings. 

19. 

While  trying  to  shift  the  focus  in  this  case  to  the  conduct  of  the  students  and 

District  administrators,  Respondent  has  failed  to  take  any  responsibility  for  her  failure  to 
abide  by  State  and  District  standards  of  conduct,  and  her  failure  to  abide  by  what  most  would 
consider  good  manners.  She  has  been  unapologetic.

  

  

20. 

(A)  As  indicated  by  Factual  Findings  5,  6,  8,  9,  and  10,  Respondent’s  conduct 

was  willful,  and  in  the  incidents  described  in  those  findings,  she  showed  indifference  to  the 
feelings  of  her  students.  She  also  showed  that  indifference  during  the  May  2009  conference 
(Factual  Finding  16,  citing  ex.  32,  p.  105).  She  exhibited  that  indifference  by  her  response  to 
counseling  provided  by  supervisors  over  a  period  of  time,  as  indicated  in  Factual  Finding  18. 

(B)  Respondent  showed  a  studied  indifference  to,  and  disregard  of,  the  Ethics 

Code,  and  other  standards  of  conduct  promulgated  by  the  District  and  by  the  State,  as 
indicated  by  Factual  Findings  11,  12,  13,  and  14. 

(C)  Respondent’s  disregard  of  the  standards  of  conduct  and  Ethics  Code  was 
willful  and  shameless,  as  indicated  by  her  admission  that  she  had  not  read  the  Ethics  Code. 
(Factual  Finding  14.)  As  noted  in  Factual  Finding  19,  she  has  been  unapologetic. 

The  Morrison  Factors 

21. 

(A)  Where  there  is  conduct  that  might  justify  termination  of  a  teacher,  an 

examination  must  still  be  made  of  whether  or  not  that  conduct  indicates  that  the  Respondent 
in  question  is  unfit  to  teach.  The  misconduct  must  be  shown  to  have  some  rational 
connection,  some  nexus,  to  the  teacher’s  ability  to  teach  in  the  District. 

(B)  This  requirement  was  first  set  forth  in  Morrison  v.  State  Board  of 

Education  (1969)  1  Cal.3d  214,  229  (Morrison).  In  that  case  a  teacher  had  been  discovered 
to  be  homosexual,  though  there  had  been  no  inkling  of  that  fact  within  the  school.  The 
California  Supreme  Court  held  that  such  alone  was  not  enough  to  discipline  his  teaching 
credential,  requiring  that  some  connection  of  his  private  conduct  be  made  to  his  job  duties 
and  performance  had  to  be  shown.  The  court  listed  a  number  of  factors  that  might  be 
considered  in  determining  whether  or  not  unfitness  to  teach  had  been  established. 

22. 

(A)  The  first  factor  to  consider  is  the  likelihood  that  the  conduct  may  have 

adversely  affected  students  or  fellow  teachers.  In  this  case,  the  record  establishes  an  adverse 
effect  upon  students,  especially  CE  7  S|  K.S.,  and  her  former  friend 

(B)  Another  factor  is  the  proximity  or  remoteness  in  time  of  the  conduct.  In 

this  case  the  misconduct  occurred  over  a  four  year  period  between  2009  and  2012.  The 
conduct  is  relatively  recent. 

(C)  Another  factor  is  the  type  of  certificate  held  by  the  teacher,  which  in  this 

case  is  a  single  subject  credential  allowing  Respondent  to  teach  high  school  students. 

(D)  Extenuating  or  aggravating  circumstances  is  another  factor  under  the 

Morrison  case.  In  this  case  there  are  no  extenuating  circumstances.  In  aggravation, 
Respondent  had  notice  of  District  policies.  However,  she  kept  herself  in  ignorance  of  the 
District’s  Ethics  Code  and,  inferentially,  other  policies.  (Factual  Findings  11-14.)  She  had 

9

been  counseled  on  a  formal  and  informal  basis  to  watch  her  behavior  and  language.  She  did 
not. 

(E)  The  praiseworthiness  or  blameworthiness  of  the  motives  resulting  in  the 

conduct  should  be  considered.  There  is  no  praiseworthiness  to  the  Respondent’s  conduct.  It 
was  blameworthy  to  act  in  a  manner  that  would  tend  to  cause  hurt.  Further,  to  disclose 
ARIE  grades  to  another  student  and  parent  was  wholly  inappropriate,  and  cannot  be 
justified  on  the  grounds  that  the  parent  of  K.S.  wanted  to  know  why  her  daughter’s 
performance  was  slipping. 

(F)  Another  factor  is  the  likelihood  that  the  conduct  in  question  will  recur. 

The  Commission  believes,  based  on  all  the  evidence  that  there  is  a  very  high  likelihood  that 
Respondent’s  misconduct  will  recur.  This  is  evidenced,  in  part,  by  her  attitude  toward  the 
District  and  its  administrators.  [tis 
statements  to  the  police  about  aa  and  as  described  in  Factual  Findings  14  and  16  through

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

Legal  Conclusions  of  General  Application: 

1. 

The  Commission  has  jurisdiction  to  proceed  in  this  matter,  pursuant  to  section 

44944,  and  Factual  Findings  1  through  4. 

2. 

“Unprofessional  conduct”  as  used  in  section  44932,  subdivision  (a)(1),  may  be 
defined  as  conduct  which  violates  the  rules  or  ethical  code  of  a  profession  or  is  such  conduct 
that  is  unbecoming  of  a  member  of  a  profession  in  good  standing.  (Board  of Education  v. 
Swan  (1953)  41  Cal.2d  546,  553.)  However,  the  conduct  in  question,  to  amount  to 
unprofessional  conduct,  must  indicate  unfitness  to  teach.  (Perez  v.  Commission  on 
Professional  Competence  (1983)  149  Cal.App.3d  1167,  1174.) 

3. 

“Evident  unfitness  for  service”  as  used  in  section  44932,  subdivision  (a)(5), 

properly  means  “clearly  not  fit,  not  adapted  to  or  unsuitable  for  teaching,  ordinarily  by 
reason  of  temperamental  defects  or  inadequacies.”  Unlike  “unprofessional  conduct,” 
“evident  unfitness  for  service”  connotes  a  fixed  character  trait,  presumably  not  remediable 
merely  on  receipt  of  notice  that  one's  conduct  fails  to  meet  the  expectations  of  the  employing 
school  district.  (Woodland  Joint  Unified  School  Dist.  v.  Commission  on  Professional 
Competence  (1992)  2  Cal.App.4th  1429,  at  1444.) 

4. 

“Immoral  conduct,”  of  which  Respondent  has  been  accused,  is  not  confined  to 
sexual  matters.  It  has  been  defined  to  mean  that  which  is  hostile  to  the  welfare  of  the  general 
public  and  contrary  to  good  morals.  It  includes  conduct  inconsistent  with  rectitude,  or 
indicative  of  corruption,  indecency,  depravity,  and  dissoluteness.  Or,  it  can  be  conduct  that 
is  willful,  flagrant,  or  shameless,  conduct  showing  moral  indifference  to  the  opinions  of 

10

respectable  members  of  the  community,  and  as  an  inconsiderate  attitude  toward  good  order 
and  the  public  welfare.  (Board  of Education  of  the  San  Francisco  Unified  School  District  v. 
Weiland  (1960)  179  Cal.  App.2d  808,  811  (Weiland);  San  Diego  Unified  School  Dist.  v. 
Commission  on  Professional  Competence  (2011)  194  Cal.App.4th  1454,  1466.) 

5. 

In  order  for  a  teacher  to  be  terminated  under  section  44932,  subdivision  (a)(7), 

for  persistent  disobedience  of  applicable  rules  and  regulations,  it  must  be  established  that 
there  has  been  continuous  and  constant  refusal  to  obey,  or  behavior  motivated  by  an  attitude 
of  continuing  insubordination;  a  single  instance  of  disobedience  is  insufficient.  (Governing 
Bad.  of  the  Oakdale  Union  School  Dist.  v.  Seaman  (1972)  28  Cal.App.3d  77,  81-82.) 

6. 

Even  where  unprofessional  conduct,  immoral  conduct,  evident  unfitness  for 

service,  or  refusal  to  follow  rules  and  regulations  is  or  are  established,  it  must  also  be 
established  that  such  conduct  renders  the  Respondent  unfit  to  teach.  (Morrison,  supra; 
Fontana  Unified  School  Dist.  v.  Burman  (1988)  45  Cal.3d  208;  Woodland  Joint  Unified 
School  District  v.  Commission  on  Professional  Competence  (1992)  2  Cal.App.4th  1429, 
1444-1445;  See  Bourland  v.  Commission  on  Professional  Competence  (1985)  174 
Cal.App.3d  317,  321.) 

7. 

(A)  It  is  settled  that  the  trier  of  fact  may  “accept  part  of  the  testimony  of  a 

witness  and  reject  another  part  even  though  the  latter  contradicts  the  part  accepted.”  (Stevens 
v.  Parke  Davis  &  Co.  (1973)  9  Cal.3d  51,  67.)  The  trier  of  fact  may  also  “reject  part  of  the 
testimony  of  a  witness,  though  not  directly  contradicted,  and  combine  the  accepted  portions 
with  bits  of  testimony  or  inferences  from  the  testimony  of  other  witnesses  thus  weaving  a 
cloth of truth  out  of  selected  material.”  (/d.,  at  67-68,  quoting  from  Neverov  v.  Caldwell 
(1958)  161  Cal.App.2d  762,  767.)  Further,  the  fact  finder  may  reject  the  testimony  of  a 
witness,  even  an  expert,  although  not  contradicted.  (Foreman  &  Clark  Corp.  v.  Fallon 
(1971)  3  Cal.3d  875,  890.)  And,  the  testimony of  “one  credible  witness  may  constitute 
substantial  evidence,”  including  a  single  expert  witness.  (Kearl  v.  Board  of  Medical  Quality 
Assurance  (1986)  189  Cal.App.3d  1040,  1052.) 

(B)  The  rejection  of  testimony  does  not  create  evidence  contrary  to  that  which 

is  deemed  untrustworthy.  That  is,  disbelief  does  not  create  affirmative  evidence  to  the 
contrary  of  that  which  is  discarded.  That  the  trier  of  fact  may  disbelieve  the  testimony  of  a 
witness  who  testifies  to  the  negative  of  an  issue  does  not  of  itself  furnish  any  evidence  in 
support  of  the  affirmative  of  that  issue,  and  does  not  warrant  a  finding  in  the  affirmative 
thereof  unless  there  is  other  evidence  in  the  case  to  support  such  affirmative.  (Hutchinson  v. 
Contractors’  State  License  Bd.  (1956)  143  Cal.App.2d  628,  632-633,  quoting  Marovich  v. 
Central  California  Traction  Co.  (1923)  191  Cal.295,  304.) 

(C)  “On  the  cold  record  a  witness  may  be  clear,  concise,  direct,  unimpeached, 

uncontradicted—but  on  a  face  to  face  evaluation,  so  exude  insincerity  as  to  render  his 
credibility  factor  nil.  Another  witness  may  fumble,  bumble,  be  unsure,  uncertain,  contradict 
himself,  and  on  the  basis  of  a  written  transcript  be  hardly  worthy  of  belief.  But  one  who  sees, 

11

hears  and  observes  him  may  be  convinced  of  his  honesty,  his  integrity,  his  reliability.” 
(Wilson  v.  State  Personnel  Board  (1976)  58  Cal.App.3d  865,  at  877-878,  quoting  Meiner  v. 
Ford  Motor  Co.  (1971)  17  Cal.App.3d  127,  140.) 

Legal  Conclusions  Pertaining  to  the  Specific  Allegations  of  the  FAA: 

8. 

Respondent’s  conduct  can  be  deemed  unprofessional  conduct.  However, 

Respondent  may  not  be  terminated  for  unprofessional  conduct.  This  is  because  complainant 
has  not  established  that  Respondent  was  served  with  a  Notice  of  Unprofessional  Conduct  and 
then  provided  with  an  opportunity  to  cure  her  unprofessional  conduct  after  receiving  such  a 
notice.  The  record  indicates  that  Respondent  was  served  with  a  Notice  of  Unprofessional 
Conduct  on  January  23,  2013.  (FAA,  ex.  21,  p.  3,  I.  13;  ex.  46..)  The  record  indicates  that 
Respondent  had  been  removed  from  the  classroom  thereafter,  and  not  returned  to  the 
classroom.  This  is  fatal  to  the  unprofessional  conduct  claim  because  she  was  not  given  the 
opportunity  to  cure  her  unprofessional  conduct;  a  jurisdictional  defect. 
Commission  on  Professional  Competence  (1978)  84  Cal.App.3d  251;  Woodland  Joint 
Unified  School  Dist.  v.  Commission  on  Professional  Competence  (1992)  2  Cal.App.4th  1429, 
1446.)  Further,  there  is  no  evidence  of  unprofessional  conduct  occurring  after  January  23, 
2013. 

(Tarquin  v. 

9. 

It  was  established  that  Respondent  is  evidently  unfit  for  service  within  the 
meaning  of  section  44932,  subdivision  (a)(5),  as  further  defined  in  Legal  Conclusion  3. 
was  established  that  she  has  fixed  character  traits  that  make  her  unsuitable  for  teaching  in  the 
District. 
While  there  is  evidence  of  positive  attributes—her  development  of  an  anthropology 
course  is  to  be  credited—her  temperament  is  such  that  she  will  invariably  say  hurtful  and 
negative  things  to  her  students,  and  then  attempt  to  fob  off  her  maladroit  statements  as  a  joke 
gone  awry.  Despite  counseling  and  advice,  she  did  not  change  her  ways.  In  the  course  of 
this  process,  which  began  with  the  service  of  the  Notice  of  Unsatisfactory  Performance, 
Respondent  has  been  defiant  and  unapologetic. 

It 

10. 

(A)  In  considering  the  totality  of  Respondent’s  conduct,  the  Commission 

concludes  that  Respondent  did  engage  in  immoral  conduct  within  the  meaning  of  sections 
44932,  subdivision  (a)(1),  and  44939,  and  the  cases  cited  in  Legal  Conclusion  4.  This 
Conclusion  is  based  on  Factual  Findings  5,  6,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12,  13,  14,  16,  18,  19,  and  20. 

(B)  The  District’s  Code  of  Conduct  with  Students,  Conduct  Code,  Ethics 
Code,  California  Standards,  and  the  School  Board’s  Resolution  pertaining  to  respectful 
treatment  of  others  (Factual  Finding  13(B))  set  forth  what  are  fairly  seen  as  a  distillation  of 
standards  for  “good  order  and  the  public  welfare”  within  the  public  schools.  At  the  same 

it

// 

12

time,  the  opinions  of  school  administrators  as  to  how  Respondent  should  behave  towards 
students  may  be  deemed  the  opinions  of  respectable  members  of  the  community.° 

(C)  Respondent’s  conduct  toward  her  students,  and  at  times  toward  her 

supervisors  (Factual  Finding  18)  showed  substantial  indifference  toward  the  opinions  of 
others.  Her  conduct  toward  her  students,  coupled  with  her  failure  to  read  the  Ethics  Code 
and  other  standards  of  conduct,  shows  to  a  substantial  degree  an  inconsiderate  attitude 
toward  good  order  and  the  public  welfare.  Her  failure  to  accept  any  responsibility  for  her 
actions  indicates  that  her  inconsiderate  and  indifferent  behavior  has  been  willful  and 
shameless. 

11. 

It  was  established  that  Respondent  has  engaged  in  persistent  disobedience  of 
applicable  rules  and  regulations,  because  it  was  established  that  Respondent’s  behavior  was 
motivated  by  an  attitude  of  disregard  for  applicable  rules  and  policies.  That  she  kept  herself 
ignorant  of  those  rules  speaks  volumes.  There  has  been a  consistent  refusal  to  follow  rules 
and  regulations.  Her  attitude  toward  her  supervisors  during  office  conferences,  and  during 
the  hearing,  indicates  that  Respondent  has  an  insubordinate  attitude.

BEFORE THE
COMMISSION ON PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA

In the Matter of the Accusation Against:

ARLENE SCHERY, 

Respondent.

OAH Case No. 2014100674

DECISION

The Commission on Professional Competence (Commission) heard the above-

captioned matter in Los Angeles on November 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 12, 2015.  The 
Commission members were John Davis, Andrea Adauto, and Joseph D. Montoya,
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH).  Complainant 
was represented by Michelle M. Goldsmith, Bergman Dacey Goldsmith, and Susan E. 
Hyman, Assistant General Counsel, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD or 
District).  Respondent Arlene Schery appeared with her attorney, Ronald C. Lapekis.

At the end of the hearing Complainant moved to amend the First Amended 
Accusation (FAA), which motion was granted.  The amendments, described below, were 
interlineated into the FAA, exhibit 21, as follows:

At page 2, line 6, paragraph 1, the words “on or about May 14, 2009,” were inserted 

in place of the words “in or about the 2008-2009 school year.”

At page 2, line 9, paragraph 2, the words “on or about May 14, 2009,” were inserted 

in place of the words “in or about the 2008-2009 school year.”

At page 2, line 20, paragraph 5, the word “Alexandria” was changed to “Alexandra,” 

and on that same line the word “Summer” was changed to “Sommer.”

At page 2, line 25, the paragraph was designated as paragraph 6c, and the first words 

were changed to read “Said, ‘Need an oil change?’.”

At page 2, line 27, the subparagraph designation was changed from “c” to “d.”

The matter was submitted for decision on November 12, 2015.  The Commission 

hereby makes its factual findings, legal conclusions, and order.

INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF THE CASE

In this proceeding the District took steps to terminate Respondent, and she demanded 

a hearing on the matter.  Four statutory grounds were asserted as justifying termination:
unprofessional conduct (Ed. Code, § 44932, subd. (a)(1)); immoral conduct (Ed. Code, §§ 
44932, subd. (a)(1) & 44939); evident unfitness for service (Ed. Code § 44932, subd. (a)(5)); 
and, persistent violation of state laws or regulations, or the district’s regulations, for the 
governance of schools (§44932, subd. (a)(7)). 1

It was alleged that on several occasions Respondent treated students in a demeaning 

and insulting way.  It was also alleged that Respondent violated her school’s cell phone
policy on more than one occasion, despite written warnings to comply.

Respondent provided evidence regarding the facts and circumstances of the events 
referenced in the FAA, and otherwise provided evidence in support of her retention by the
District. However, the District proved the vast majority of the allegations against 
Respondent, and the Commission finds and concludes, unanimously, that cause for 
termination has been established.

The Parties and Jurisdiction

FACTUAL FINDINGS

1.

Complainant Justo H. Avila executed the Accusation and the FAA while

acting in his official capacity as Chief Human Resources Officer of the District.

2.

The District commenced this proceeding on April 26, 2013, when Vivian K. 
Ekchian executed a Statement of Charges against Respondent.  That Statement of Charges 
was filed with the District's governing board, which thereafter voted to terminate 
Respondent.

3.

On May 14, 2013, the District gave Respondent written notice of its intent to 
terminate her, and served Respondent with a copy of the Statement of Charges.  Respondent 
made a timely request for hearing, which led to the issuance of the Accusation.  She then 
filed a Notice of Defense, and this proceeding ensued.  On October 23, 2015, ALJ Michael 
Scarlett granted the District’s motion to file an amended accusation.  By operation of law, 
Respondent is deemed to have denied the allegations of the FAA.  All jurisdictional 
requirements have been met.

4.

Respondent is a certificated teacher employed by the District, and at the times 

relevant to this decision was teaching history and anthropology to high school students.
Respondent holds a clear single subject teaching credential, with a social studies

authorization.  She also holds a Cross-cultural, Language and Academic Development 
credential (CLAD).  During the time relevant to this proceeding—May 14, 2009, to October 
25, 2012—Respondent was assigned to teach at Eagle Rock High School.

Findings on the Allegations of the FAA 2

5.

(A)  It was established that during the period between May 14, 2009, and May

28, 2009, Respondent treated her student, C
demeaning manner.  Respondent referred to the student as being “dumb.”  Respondent would 
mispronounce the student’s name and when the student would explain how to pronounce her 
name correctly, Respondent would make no real effort to get the name right.  Instead, she 
would repeat the name, improperly in two or three ways, and then say “whatever.”  This 
showed both disrespect to the student and an unprofessional attitude.

 S., in a derogatory manner and a

(B)  Respondent’s failure to make a real attempt to learn how to say her 

 to pronounce certain 
 was an ESL (English as a Second Language) student, one whose 

student’s name properly is juxtaposed to her efforts to teach C
words properly.  C
primary language was not English, but Spanish.  When the student would give presentations, 
she would mispronounce some words, and Respondent would correct her pronunciation in 
front of the whole class, who often laughed, to the discomfort of C
.  The Commission 
recognizes that Respondent should teach her students in a way that expands their vocabulary, 
and that correcting pronunciation is not unprofessional in and of itself.  However, the 
evidence indicates that Respondent went about the task in an insensitive way that exposed 
C
student’s name.

 to ridicule, while she herself was not exposed to ridicule for mispronouncing the 

6.

During the period after May 14, 2009, and through the end of the 2009 school 

year, Respondent made disparaging remarks about people who speak Spanish, and about 
Mexicans.  She did this in class, and her classes had many students who were of Mexican or 
other Hispanic descent. She also referred to a neighborhood where some of the students 
lived, and which was known to have gang elements, in a way that painted all of her students 
as involved in gangs.  

7.

(A)  On or about October 12, 2012, Respondent confiscated a cell phone from 
one of her students, A
 O., because he was violating the Eagle Rock High School Cell 
Phone Policy (Phone Policy).  The Phone Policy essentially forbade students from using cell 
phones during the school day.

(B)  Teachers who confiscated cell phones were, required to turn the devices 
over to the Dean before the end of the day, because the students were authorized to retrieve 
their confiscated cell phones at the end of the day, if they were accompanied by a parent. If 
the Dean was unavailable, the phone could be left at the administration office, as it was open 
until 4:30, and there was a place to secure the phone at that office.

2 As amended at the end of the hearing

 

 

3

(D)  On three occasions between November 20, 2009 and June 6, 2012, 
Respondent had been reminded, in writing, that confiscated phones or other electronic 
devices had to be turned in the day they were confiscated.

(D)  Respondent did not turn the phone over to the Dean, or the administration 
office, on October 12, 2012.  Instead, she took it home, despite knowledge of her obligations, 
thereby failing to follow policy and directives previously given to her.  Her excuse was that 
she could not find the Dean in his office, and that her work day was over at 3:07 p.m., and 
that she was entitled, under the union contract to go straight home, and she was not 
obligated, after school, to locate the Dean, or otherwise take steps to turn the phone in.  This 
ignores the fact that she could have taken the phone to the administration office on her way
out of school, which would have secured the phone but left it accessible to the Dean or 
another administrator if the student and their parent came to retrieve the phone.

(A)  In approximately September 2012, Respondent directed a student named 

8.
E
 to tape a picture of a creature that looked like a monkey or an ape onto the chest of 
another student, M .  Respondent then told M  to come to the front of the room, which 
he refused to do.

(B)  The picture in question was, according to Respondent, an artist’s likeness 

of “Lucy,” considered to be the oldest hominid, and precursor in the evolutionary chain, to 
humans.  However, to a casual observer, it would appear to be a picture of some sort of ape.

(C)  At some point during the interaction, Respondent stated that the picture 
was a picture of M .  M  and other students took this to be Respondent making fun of 
M , who is somewhat hairy, with heavy eyebrows, and who, as a child, was sensitive to 
being “hairy.”

(D)  By telling M  to come to the front of the room, Respondent intended to 

make him the butt of some joke she had in mind.  That he would not go to the front of the 
room indicates he perceived he was to be made the butt of her joke.  Respondent’s conduct 
was demeaning to M  and was perceived that way by other students.3    

9.

(A)  On October 25, 2012, Respondent discussed confidential information 

 with the another student, and the other student’s mother.

pertaining to her student A
It was improper for her to do so.

(B) The discussion took place during a student-led parent teacher conference 
that took place in Respondent’s classroom on the evening of October 25, 2012.  Respondent 
was meeting with her student, K.S., and the student’s mother (Mom).  At some point during 
the conference, Mom told Respondent that her daughter’s grades had been declining, and she

investigator.

daughter, K.S., was hanging around with the wrong friends, and then named A

10.

(A)  On October 24, 2012, Respondent engaged in assaultive and abusive 

behavior toward a student, known as Z , when Z 4 was sent to her classroom by another 
teacher.  The facts and circumstances follow.

(B)  On the day in question, Z and A

(referenced in Factual Finding 
9), were brought to Respondent’s classroom by Mr. Dominguez, who taught the two students 
Spanish in a nearby classroom.  Dominguez asked Respondent if the two students could be 
placed in her room for awhile, as they were acting up in the Spanish class.  Mr. Dominguez 
said he had some work that the two students could do. Respondent agreed with Dominguez’s 
request.

(C)  While discussing the matter, Dominguez said of Z that the student was 
acting up, and that he had the devil in him, or words to that effect.  Respondent told Z and
A

where to sit, which was in desks near the back right section of the classroom.

(D)  Respondent went to the back of the room near Z and splashed or poured 

some water on him, and sprayed him with a spray bottle labeled as whiteboard cleaner.  She 
said words to the effect that the water was to get the devil out of him, implying some sort of 
exorcism needed to take place.

(E) Z was surprised and shocked by Respondent’s conduct.  An exchange 

followed, and during the course of that exchange Respondent told Z to get his finger out of 
his ass.5

 
4 The student’s first and middle name was R

 

Z .  Some of the students knew him as R

 Z
.  (See ex. 41, p. 3.)  

, and he went by the name 

5 Respondent told a police officer, when interviewed by him the next day, that she 

told Z to get his head out of his ass and to get some work done. That version of the event is 

5

(F)  At another point during the exchange, Respondent held a metal rod, at 

times during the proceeding described as a dipstick for an automobile engine, and said it was 
for checking Z ’s oil, and moved the stick up and down in a gesture perceived as obscene 
by Z .

(G) Z , who is openly gay, perceived that Respondent was attacking him on 

that point.  He made a complaint to the school administration before the day was out.

(H)  The interchange was witnessed by several students.  One of them, S

, 
later described Z as “that poor guy” who “looked like he was in shock.”  He went on to say
“that poor guy [Z ] just looked freaked by the time he left the class.”  (Ex. 41, pp. 2-3.)

11.

The District established that Respondent had, during the relevant time period, 
received direction and counseling regarding her behaviors.  The District has had policies in 
place that governed the actions of permanent teachers such as Respondent, and Respondent 
had notice of those policies.  Those policies proscribed Respondent’s misconduct.

12.

(A)  On May 29, 2009, following the events involving C

, Respondent 

had a conference with an assistant principal that dealt, in part, with the events regarding that 
student.  Respondent received a memo regarding the conference.  That memo cited 
provisions of the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (Cal. Standards), the 
LAUSD Code of Conduct (Conduct Code), LAUSD Code of Ethics (Ethics Code), and the
LAUSD Respectful Treatment of All Others Policy (Respect Policy).

(B)  According to the memo, Cal. Standards sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 were 
discussed with Respondent.  Also discussed was the Conduct Code, numbers 3 and 5, the 
Ethics Code, wherein it is stated teachers must treat students with respect, as well as similar 
provisions of the Respect Policy.

(C)  Copies of the Conduct Code, Cal. Standards, Ethics Code, and Respect 
Policy were transmitted to Respondent along with a copy of the memo issued after the May
28, 2009 meeting.

13.

(A)  At the beginning of every school year, all the teachers at Eagle Rock High 

School received a number of documents that set out District policies and procedures.  In the 
school years 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2012-2013, Respondent received copies of such 
documents at the beginning of each school year.

(B)  The documents received by Respondent at the beginning of each school 

year included the District’s Code of Conduct with Students, Conduct Code, Ethics Code, Cal. 

not credited by the Commission, but is a tacit admission of improper conduct.  She also 
attacked Z ’s credibility, claiming he had a chip on his shoulder.  (Ex. 41, p. 3.)

6

Standards, and the School Board’s Resolution pertaining to the respectful treatment of all 
persons.

(C)  The aforementioned documents put Respondent on notice of what she 

should know in any event:  that conduct tending to insult or demean students was improper.

14.

During the hearing Respondent stated she had never read the Ethics Code.  It 
is inferred she had not read the other policy materials that had been transmitted to her on a 
yearly basis.

Other Matters

15.

(A) Z did not testify at the hearing because he now resides in Arizona, 

beyond the reach of a subpoena.  He was deposed by both parties in June 2015.  Respondent 
argued that the credibility of his testimony should be scrutinized in light of the many times
he claimed, while being examined by Respondent’s counsel, not to recall something. 

(B)  As noted in the Legal Conclusions below, discerning a witness’s 

credibility from a cold transcript is problematic.  Z ’s nearly complete refusal to answer 
questions put to him by Respondent’s counsel, following a barrage of objections by District’s
counsel has harmed, but not destroyed, Z ’s credibility regarding the incident in October 
2012.  However, the bulk of his claims were corroborated by other witnesses and 
contemporaneous statements.  In this regard, the statements by S
day, memorialized in exhibit 41, supported the findings made on the incident with Z .

 to the police the next 

16.

Respondent’s credibility suffered during her testimony, in that she herself had 
memory lapses, and sometimes had a truculent demeanor during cross examination.  Further, 
testimony she gave in a deposition taken in connection with this proceeding, a deposition 
taken in connection with her workers’ compensation claim against the District, and testimony
during a workers’ compensation hearing, provided inconsistent positions on some of the key
events.  And, Respondent had made some damning admissions. As noted above, when
questioned by police the day after the incident with Z , she denied telling him to get a digit 
out of his ass, instead saying she told Z  to get his head out of his ass.  During the 
conference in May 2009, where her attitude toward Hispanic students was questioned, she 
said “you get called a racist all the time.  Doesn’t everyone?”  (Ex. 32, p. 105.)

17.

Respondent attempted to make these issues of her conduct into a case against 
the way the District is administered, and not about her behavior.  At times she claimed that 
she was being let go because the District wants to fire its higher-paid teachers.  There was no 
evidence she is among the highest paid teachers, nor was there a hint of such a motive on the 
District’s part.  When she received the Notice of Unsatisfactory Acts and Notice of 
Suspension in January 2013, she stated that the principal and other administrators in the 
District were acting like Nazis, “just following orders” like the senior Nazis claimed they had
been doing when they were brought to justice at Nuremberg after the Second World War.

7

Such pernicious insults had no justification. She has made claims of sexual harassment and 
retaliation that went unsupported.

18.

The record establishes that Respondent was counseled, informally and

formally, that she had to watch her behavior and guard against making hurtful statements.
The former principal at Eagle Rock High School testified that Respondent made hurtful 
comments about his accent, and he tried to get her to understand that she was being 
inappropriate.  Other supervisors testified to hearing occasional complaints from students 
that Respondent was saying inappropriate things in class, often with racial overtones or 
making statements that were demeaning of some of the students. Those supervisors 
counseled Respondent to take care not to act in an offensive manner.  Respondent failed to 
heed those warnings.

19. While trying to shift the focus in this case to the conduct of the students and 

District administrators, Respondent has failed to take any responsibility for her failure to 
abide by State and District standards of conduct, and her failure to abide by what most would 
consider good manners.  She has been unapologetic.

The Morrison Factors

20.

(A) Where there is conduct that might justify termination of a teacher, an 

examination must still be made of whether or not that conduct indicates that the Respondent 
in question is unfit to teach.  The misconduct must be shown to have some rational
connection, some nexus, to the teacher’s ability to teach in the District.

(B) This requirement was first set forth in Morrison v. State Board of 

Education (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 229 (Morrison). In that case a teacher had been discovered 
to be homosexual, though there had been no inkling of that fact within the school.  The
California Supreme Court held that such alone was not enough to discipline his teaching 
credential, requiring that some connection of his private conduct be made to his job duties 
and performance had to be shown. The court listed a number of factors that might be 
considered in determining whether or not unfitness to teach had been established.

21.

(A)  The first factor to consider is the likelihood that the conduct may have

adversely affected students or fellow teachers.  In this case, the record establishes an adverse 
.
effect upon students, especially C

, K.S., and her former friend A

, Z , S

(B)  Another factor is the proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct. In

this case the misconduct occurred over a four year period between 2009 and 2012.  The 
conduct is relatively recent.

(C)  Another factor is the type of certificate held by the teacher, which in this 

case is a single subject credential allowing Respondent to teach high school students.

8

(D)  Extenuating or aggravating circumstances is another factor under the 

Morrison case.  In this case there are no extenuating circumstances.  In aggravation,
Respondent had notice of District policies.  However, she kept herself in ignorance of the 
District’s Ethics Code and, inferentially, other policies.  (Factual Findings 11-14.)  She had 
been counseled on a formal and informal basis to watch her behavior and language.  She did 
not.

(E) The praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the motives resulting in the 

conduct should be considered.  There is no praiseworthiness to the Respondent’s conduct.  It 
was blameworthy to act in a manner that would tend to cause hurt.  Further, to disclose 
A
justified on the grounds that the parent of K.S. wanted to know why her daughter’s 
performance was slipping.

’s grades to another student and parent was wholly inappropriate, and cannot be 

(F)  Another factor is the likelihood that the conduct in question will recur.

The Commission believes, based on all the evidence that there is a very high likelihood that 
Respondent’s misconduct will recur.  This is evidenced, in part, by her attitude toward the 
District and its administrators.  It is also shown by her attitude generally, as illustrated in her 
statements to the police about Z , and as described in Factual Findings 14 and 16 through 
19.

Legal Conclusions of General Application:

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS

1.

The Commission has jurisdiction to proceed in this matter, pursuant to section

44944, and Factual Findings 1 through 4.

2.

“Unprofessional conduct” as used in section 44932, subdivision (a)(1), may be
defined as conduct which violates the rules or ethical code of a profession or is such conduct 
that is unbecoming of a member of a profession in good standing.  (Board of Education v. 
Swan (1953) 41 Cal.2d 546, 553.)  However, the conduct in question, to amount to 
unprofessional conduct, must indicate unfitness to teach.  (Perez v. Commission on 
Professional Competence (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1167, 1174.)

3.

“Evident unfitness for service” as used in section 44932, subdivision (a)(5), 

properly means “clearly not fit, not adapted to or unsuitable for teaching, ordinarily by
reason of temperamental defects or inadequacies.” Unlike “unprofessional conduct,” 
“evident unfitness for service” connotes a fixed character trait, presumably not remediable 
merely on receipt of notice that one's conduct fails to meet the expectations of the employing
school district.  (Woodland Joint Unified School Dist. v. Commission on Professional 
Competence (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1429, at 1444.)

9

4.

“Immoral conduct,” of which Respondent has been accused, is not confined to 
sexual matters.  It has been defined to mean that which is hostile to the welfare of the general 
public and contrary to good morals.  It includes conduct inconsistent with rectitude, or 
indicative of corruption, indecency, depravity, and dissoluteness.  Or, it can be conduct that 
is willful, flagrant, or shameless, conduct showing moral indifference to the opinions of 
respectable members of the community, and as an inconsiderate attitude toward good order 
and the public welfare.  (Board of Education of the San Francisco Unified School District v. 
Weiland (1960) 179 Cal. App.2d 808, 811 (Weiland); San Diego Unified School Dist. v. 
Commission on Professional Competence (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1466.)

5.

In order for a teacher to be terminated under section 44932, subdivision (a)(7), 

for persistent disobedience of applicable rules and regulations, it must be established that 
there has been continuous and constant refusal to obey, or behavior motivated by an attitude 
of continuing insubordination; a single instance of disobedience is insufficient.  (Governing
Bd. of the Oakdale Union School Dist. v. Seaman (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 77, 81-82.)

6.

Even where unprofessional conduct, immoral conduct, evident unfitness for 

service, or refusal to follow rules and regulations is or are established, it must also be 
established that such conduct renders the Respondent unfit to teach.  (Morrison,supra;
Fontana Unified School Dist. v. Burman (1988) 45 Cal.3d 208; Woodland Joint Unified 
School District v. Commission on Professional Competence (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1429, 
1444-1445; See Bourland v. Commission on Professional Competence (1985) 174 
Cal.App.3d 317, 321.)

7.

(A) It is settled that the trier of fact may “accept part of the testimony of a 

witness and reject another part even though the latter contradicts the part accepted.”  (Stevens
v. Parke Davis & Co. (1973) 9 Cal.3d 51, 67.)  The trier of fact may also “reject part of the 
testimony of a witness, though not directly contradicted, and combine the accepted portions 
with bits of testimony or inferences from the testimony of other witnesses thus weaving a 
cloth of truth out of selected material.”  (Id., at 67-68, quoting from Neverov v. Caldwell
(1958) 161 Cal.App.2d 762, 767.)  Further, the fact finder may reject the testimony of a 
witness, even an expert, although not contradicted.  (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon
(1971) 3 Cal.3d  875, 890.)  And, the testimony of “one credible witness may constitute
substantial evidence,” including a single expert witness.  (Kearl v. Board of Medical Quality 
Assurance (1986) 189 Cal.App.3d 1040, 1052.)

(B)  The rejection of testimony does not create evidence contrary to that which 

is deemed untrustworthy.  That is, disbelief does not create affirmative evidence to the 
contrary of that which is discarded.  That the trier of fact may disbelieve the testimony of a 
witness who testifies to the negative of an issue does not of itself furnish any evidence in 
support of the affirmative of that issue, and does not warrant a finding in the affirmative 
thereof unless there is other evidence in the case to support such affirmative.  (Hutchinson v. 
Contractors’ State License Bd. (1956) 143 Cal.App.2d 628, 632-633, quoting Marovich v. 
Central California Traction Co. (1923) 191 Cal.295, 304.)

10

(C)  “On the cold record a witness may be clear, concise, direct, unimpeached,

uncontradicted—but on a face to face evaluation, so exude insincerity as to render his 
credibility factor nil. Another witness may fumble, bumble, be unsure, uncertain, contradict 
himself, and on the basis of a written transcript be hardly worthy of belief. But one who sees,

hears and observes him may be convinced of his honesty, his integrity, his reliability.”
(Wilson v. State Personnel Board (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 865, at 877-878, quoting Meiner v.
Ford Motor Co. (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 127, 140.)

Legal Conclusions Pertaining to the Specific Allegations of the FAA:

8.

Respondent’s conduct can be deemed unprofessional conduct.  However, 

Respondent may not be terminated for unprofessional conduct.  This is because complainant 
has not established that Respondent was served with a Notice of Unprofessional Conduct and 
then provided with an opportunity to cure her unprofessional conduct after receiving such a 
notice.  The record indicates that Respondent was served with a Notice of Unprofessional 
Conduct on January 23, 2013.  (FAA, ex. 21, p. 3, l. 13; ex. 46..)  The record indicates that 
Respondent had been removed from the classroom thereafter, and not returned to the 
classroom.  This is fatal to the unprofessional conduct claim because she was not given the 
opportunity to cure her unprofessional conduct; a jurisdictional defect.
Commission on Professional Competence (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 251; Woodland Joint 
Unified School Dist. v. Commission on Professional Competence (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1429, 
1446.)  Further, there is no evidence of unprofessional conduct occurring after January 23,
2013.

 (Tarquin v. 

9.

It was established that Respondent is evidently unfit for service within the 

meaning of section 44932, subdivision (a)(5), as further defined in Legal Conclusion 3.  It 
was established that she has fixed character traits that make her unsuitable for teaching in the 
District.   While there is evidence of positive attributes—her development of an anthropology
course is to be credited—her temperament is such that she will invariably say hurtful and 
negative things to her students, and then attempt to fob off her maladroit statements as a joke 
gone awry.  Despite counseling and advice, she did not change her ways.  In the course of 
this process, which began with the service of the Notice of Unsatisfactory Performance,
Respondent has been defiant and unapologetic.

10.

It was not established that Respondent engaged in immoral conduct within the 

meaning of sections 44932, subdivision (a)(1) and 44939, and the cases cited in Legal 
Conclusion 4.  Even the most serious incident—the incident involving Z —did not quite 
cross the line to immoral conduct.

11.

It was established that Respondent has engaged in persistent disobedience of 
applicable rules and regulations, because it was established that Respondent’s behavior was 
motivated by an attitude of disregard for applicable rules and policies.  That she kept herself 
ignorant of those rules speaks volumes.  There has been a consistent refusal to follow rules 

11

and regulations.  Her attitude toward her supervisors during office conferences, and during 
the hearing, indicates that Respondent has an insubordinate attitude.

12.

The Commission agrees unanimously that grounds for termination have been 

established; this includes consideration of the Morrison factors as set forth in Factual 
Findings 20 and 21.

ORDER

Respondent Arlene Schery shall be terminated as a certificated employee of the Los

Angeles Unified School District, forthwith.
