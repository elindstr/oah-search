(with the exception of the 2021/22 school year). Kolb reports that there were more 
than five complaints about respondent from students and employees prior to the 
2022/23 school year, but several complaints during the 2022/23 school year, including 
the five complaints alleged in the statement of charges relating to that year. Kolb 
reports that many students refused to provide written statements, but would tell him

84. Kolb authenticated 11 written statements submitted by Pinole students 
during the 2022/23 school year, each alleging unprofessional conduct by respondent.

RESPONDENT S EVIDENCE REGARDING THE STUDENT COMPLAINTS AT PINOLE 
91. Respondent reports that he was never interviewed regarding student 
complaints at Pinole. 
92. Respondent is familiar with each of the students who submitted the 
written statements described in Factual Findings 85 through 90. 
93. Respondent denies ever using a racial slur to describe any student. He 
reports teaching lessons about the use of language, including racial slurs. He 
submitted -
addressing her experiences with the 
- and how that experience varied depending on the context of its use. He also 
. Respondent 
explained that a student had complained that he felt pressured to use the n-word 
during class (this complaint is not an allegation in this matter). In the email chain, 
respondent denied pressuring any student to use this term and also provided a 28 lengthy explanation of his teaching on this subject, which appears appropriately 
academic (there is no allegation in this matter that were 
inappropriate). 
94. Respondent admits that he routinely confiscated phones from students 
using them in class, but denies ever talking a phone from  Respondent 
 Respondent opined 
that GPC, S, and TG made these allegations because they were disappointed their 
phones were taken away. 
95. Surprisingly, respondent repeatedly testified that he never has 
conversations with students; he only delivers instructions and responds to inquiries, 
and that he gets to know students through their writing. However, when asked about 
espondent admitted her. Then 
he testified that he did not make with her, but he 
in reference to her doing her own makeup, which he describes as 
skill that she was de and not a joke: 
No, wed talk about observations. I ll make an observation. 
Either she d laugh or she wouldn t, orit wasnt meant as a 
joke. It was an observation of a skill or talent being 
developed by a student, on their own. 
Respondent testified that [y]
he does not know if TG was offended by that statement. 
Later respondent whether she 
 that this is 29 mother would have 
complained to him if TG had been offended. 
96. 
 
97. Respondent denies complimenting students  appearances. Respondent 
, but admits calling her

her asking him to stop using those terms. Respondent reports that he used these 
terms when a student was in a bad or desperate position, to let the student know the 
 Respondent testified that he remembers this day 
and JS was in tears before he made the comments. 
She was crying. Tears were literally coming out of her eyes. 
She had an incident while walking into my classroom. I 
in tears. I know when students are in emotional turmoil, 
because I know my students. 
And with this student, with whom I share a community of 
practice, this is an inspirational thing been told to me 
and other sisters and brothers that I have spoken with, 
working with, lived with my entire life, within my 
community, which you are not a member, and I shared this 
because she was in a moment of turmoil and crying and in 30 desperation, and it was a source of inspiration. She cleaned 
it up that day. She walked off feeling a whole lot better. 
Respondent testified that this incident occurred in December 2022, and that he was 
not at school on February 6, 2023, the date of most of the written statements at issue. 
98.  
99. Respondent denies any recollection of DA asking to go to a meeting in 
the library, but testified that DA was not on the list of students excused to leave class. 
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
100. In  written response, he described Pierce as 
he described 
being as faulty as his commitment to his nuptials.  At hearing, when 
asked if he thought these statements were appropriate, respondent denied that these 
statements were unprofessional and testified they were appropriate because they 
showed that Pierce  lie  
101. At hearing, respondent testified that there is no truth to any of the 
 to anyone. 
Additional Evidence 
102. Owen G. DeVance testified in support of respondent. DeVance has been 
a teacher for approximately 15 years, 10 in the District. Prior to that he was a human 
resources consultant for a large public utility for 30 years. He is a social studies teacher 
and familiar with respondent from their work together at Pinole and De Anza, 
including judging speech contests together. 31 103. DeVance reports that he considers respondent both a colleague and a 
friend. He regards respondent as a dedicated educator who loves his family. DeVance 
did not observe respondent in the classroom, but reports that he observed respondent 
interact with students one night 
that night were all positive. DeVance is not aware of any complaints about respondent, 
but reports that he does not hear students complain about any teachers because his 
students know that gossip about other teachers or students is . 
Ultimate Findings 
104. it was sometimes 
contradictory and implausible.  witnesses appeared sincere and testified 
in a straightforward manner, consistent with other evidence. In each instance where 
 
testimony was less credible.  
202122 SCHOOL YEAR AT DE ANZA HIGH SCHOOL 
105. The evidence shows that it is more likely than not that respondent: 
 threatened student KN with his shoe or sandal (second alleged incident); 
 threw his glasses at student KD (third alleged incident); 
 referred to student DYR as  (fourth 
alleged incident), compared her to a picture of a black water bug, told her 
and also called 
another student (who was of Mexican heritage) ; 32 made a threatening gesture towards George Jackson (finger guns) (sixth 
alleged incident); 
 made unprofessional statements to students (implying that they were dirty) 
ninth alleged incident);  
 wore a De Anza sweatshirt at school, that he had altered with a violent 
image that faculty and staff reasonably interpreted as a threat of violence or 
a statement of hatred for the school, students, or faculty. 
106. The evidence was insufficient to show that respondent: 
 inappropriately touched the head and stroked the hair of student JJF (first 
alleged incident); 
 
Morato from the [class]room for performing her job duties  (fifth alleged 
incident); 
 ngr
related to a payroll issue (seventh alleged incident); 
 hugged and patted the side of student JB about five or six times, causing AB 
to ask him to stop (eighth alleged incident); 
 grabbed a tablet and charger out of student

early 2023: 
 made an inappropriate joke about the cosmetic makeup of student TG 
(seventeenth alleged incident); and 
 called

and in her written 
statement TG characterized

observation of a skill that she was developing Respondent also 
 testimony that he used those terms with the intention of being 
supportive was credible, even though JS apparently did not welcome these statements. 
108. The evidence was insufficient to show that respondent: 
 used racial slurs in the classroom outside an appropriate educational context 
(thirteenth and sixteenth alleged incidents); 
 g
(thirteenth and fourteenth alleged incidents); 
 made inappropriate comments to student DA, implying DA was not smart 
enough to be part of a Pinole special project (fifteenth alleged incident); or 
 made inappropriate comments to student ELW (eighteenth alleged incident). 34 present any 
students were not available for cross-examination. It is also possible that one or more 
students may have viewed an educationally appropriate discussion of racial slurs in the 
classroom as inappropriate.

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 
Burden and Standard of Proof 
1. The District bears the burden to prove cause to dismiss respondent. The 
standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence. (
 (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 1035, 1038-1039.) The Commission 
credibility, in making the factual findings above. These findings reflect a 
preponderance of the evidence. 35 Respondent Received Sufficient Due Process Prior to 
Move to Dismiss Him 
2. Respondent asserts that he should not be terminated because the 
District failed to provide him due process prior to moving for dismissal, based on his 
own testimony that no one from human resources sat down with [him] prior to the 
issuance of the Statement of Charges to discuss their concerns and allegations.  
However, the evidence established that the District secured a third-party investigation 
into the De Anza allegations prior to suspending respondent for 45 days in November 
2021 and provided respondent the right to a hearing in spring 2023. 
Respondent received sufficient due process prior  
First Cause for Dismissal (Immoral Conduct) 
3. Pursuant to Education Code section 44932, subdivision (a)(1), a school 
district may dismiss a permanent certificated employee for immoral conduct. Courts

5. Respondent threatened to and did throw objects at students; made 
numerous demeaning, or racially or sexually harassing statements to students; 
threatened a staff member; and wore a sweatshirt at school altered with a violent 
image which faculty and staff reasonably interpreted as a threat of violence or a 
statement of hatred for the school, students, or faculty. (Factual Findings 105 & 107.)

section 44932, subdivision (a)(1). 
Second Cause for Dismissal (Unprofessional Conduct) 
6. Pursuant to section 44932, subdivision (a)(2), a school district may 
dismiss a permanent certificated employee for unprofessional conduct. The term 
, but the California 
Supreme Court has held the term may be construed consistent with common usage as 
conduct that 
is unbecoming a member of a profession in good standing.  (  (1953) 41 
Cal.2d 546, 553 [overruled on other grounds].) 37 unprofessional under section 44932, subdivision (a)(2). (Factual Findings 105 & 107, 
see Legal Conclusion 5.) 
Third Alleged Cause for Dismissal (Unsatisfactory Performance) 
7. Pursuant to section 44932, subdivision (a)(5), a school district may 
dismiss a permanent certificated employee for unsatisfactory performance. 
8. Sections 44660 through 44665 set forth the requirements for evaluating 
certificated employees. Section 44662, in relevant part, provides: 
(b) The governing board of each school district shall 
evaluate and assess certificated employee performance as it 
reasonably relates to: 
(1) The progress of pupils toward the standards established 
pursuant to subdivision (a) and, if applicable, the state 
adopted academic content standards as measured by state 
adopted criterion referenced assessments. 
(2) The instructional techniques and strategies used by the 
employee. 
(3)  
(4) The establishment and maintenance of a suitable 
responsibilities. 38 9. Section 44664, in relevant part, provides:
(b) The evaluation shall include recommendations, if 
necessary, as to areas of improvement in the performance 
of the employee. If an employee is not performing his or 
her duties in a satisfactory manner according to the 
standards prescribed by the governing board, the 
employing authority shall notify the employee in writing of 
that fact and describe the unsatisfactory performance. The 
employing authority shall thereafter confer with the 
employee making specific recommendations as to areas of 
to assist the employee in his or her performance. If any 
permanent certificated employee has received an 
unsatisfactory evaluation, the employing authority shall 
annually evaluate the employee until the employee achieves 
a positive evaluation or is separated from the district. 
10. Before a school district may dismiss a permanent certificated employee 
for unsatisfactory performance, it must comply with section 44938, subdivision (b), 
which, in relevant part, provides: 
(1) At least 90 calendar days prior to the date of the filing, 
the board or its authorized representative has given the 
employee against whom the charge is filed, written notice 
of the unsatisfactory performance, specifying the nature 
thereof with such specific instances of behavior and with 
such particularity as to furnish the employee an opportunity 39 to correct his or her faults and overcome the grounds for 
the charge. The written notice shall include the evaluation 
made pursuant to Article 11 (commencing with Section 
44660) of Chapter 3, if applicable to the employee. 
11. The District did not provide evidence of unsatisfactory performance 
evaluations (Factual Finding 109) and does not argue or point to any evidence to show 
that it proved cause to dismiss respondent on this basis. Cause does not exist to 
dismiss respondent from employment for unsatisfactory performance under section 
44932, subdivision (a)(5). 
Fourth Cause for Dismissal (Evident Unfitness for Service) 
12. A school district may dismiss a permanent certificated employee for 
Evident unfitness for service 
 ( ) (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1429, 
presumably not 
at p. 1444 ) Such evident unfitness 
may exist, for example, when a teacher is repeatedly and incurably insubordinate, or is 
incapable of maintaining cordial, cooperative, and professional relationships with 
colleagues. ( ., at pp. 1436-1440.)  
Unprofessional conduct  is, as it were, often a lesser 
included form of proscribed behavior within evident 
unfitness for service.  Thus, conduct constituting evident 40 unfitness for service will often constitute unprofessional 
conduct.  But the converse is not true. Evident unfitness for 
service requires that unfitness for service be attributable to 
a defect in temperament a requirement not necessary for 
a finding of unprofessional conduct.  
( at p. 1445.) 
13. As discussed in Legal Conclusions 5, respondent committed numerous 
acts of unprofessional conduct, even after formal counseling to cease. At hearing, 
even a single instance 
of wrongdoing. He appears to be incapable of maintaining cordial, cooperative, and 
professional relationships with colleagues or many of his students. Respondent is 
evidently unfit for service as a teacher under section 44932, subdivision (a)(6). (See 
2 Cal.App.4th at 1429, 1444.) 
Fifth Cause for Termination (Persistent Violation of or Refusal to 
Obey Applicable Laws or Regulations) 
14. A school district may dismiss a teacher who engages in a persistent 
violation of or refusal to obey the school laws of the state or reasonable regulations 
prescribed for the government of the public schools by the State Board of Education 
or by the governing board of the school district. (§ 44932, subd. (a)(8).) Such violations 
by 
 (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1183.) 
The willful refusal of a teacher to obey the reasonable rules and regulations of the 
employing board of education is insubordination. (
 (1953) 41 Cal.2d 546, 552, overruled on other grounds by 41 (1972) 6 Cal.3d 575.) However, a contentious debate between a 
teacher and principal about teaching objectives, even where the teacher repeatedly 
process, is not cause to dismiss a teacher for persistent violation. (
 (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 317, 321.) Nor is a 
single violation of a school board s rules, by itself, cause for dismissal under this 
section. (  (1972) 104 Cal.Rptr. 64.) 
15. Without further specificity or explanation, respondent cites  
() (2009) 177 
Cal.App.4th 1379, and argues that show willful refusal the District must show direct 
insubordination. No such rule is apparent in the statute, , or any of the cases 
cited in Legal Conclusion 14. 
16. misconduct was a detriment to the integrity and goals of 
the District, demonstrated disrespect to students and staff members, and the Altered 
Sweatshirt , and 
professional standards, positive 
school climate, and dress and grooming policies set forth in Factual Findings 10 
through 12. Respondent engaged in a persistent violation of or refusal to obey District 
policies under section 44932, subdivision (a)(8). 
Analysis of the  Factors 
17. The ultimate question is whether respondent is unfit to teach under the 
factors established by the California Supreme Court in 
 (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 229-230. The  factors are: (1) the likelihood 
that the conduct in question may have adversely affected students or fellow teachers, 42 and the degree of such adversity anticipated; (2) the proximity or remoteness in time 
of the conduct; (3) the type of teaching certificate held by the teacher; (4) the 
extenuating or aggravating circumstances, if any, surrounding the conduct; (5) the 
praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the motives resulting in the conduct; (6) the 
likelihood of the recurrence of the questioned conduct; and (7) the extent to which 
disciplinary action may inflict an adverse impact or chilling effect upon the 
constitutional rights of the teacher involved or other teachers. Only the pertinent 
factors must be addressed. (
 (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1766, 1777.) The factors may be applied to all of the 
proven conduct in the aggregate. ( , 2 
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1456-1457.) 
18. In this case, application of the pertinent Morrison factors demonstrates 
that respondent is unfit to teach. 
 severe adverse effect on several students, 
teachers, and staff members, as reported under oath by students DYR and KD, 
administrators Pierce and White, staff members Jackson and Fletcher, and teachers 
Marlene and Kathleen Trempy. 
 . 
 Aggravating factors include the large number of acts of wrongdoing, the 
continued misconduct after receiving oral and written counseling to cease, and 
respondent  refusal to admit he committed almost all of these acts or acknowledge 
any wrongfulness of the acts. A mitigating factor is 
years of teaching without adverse action. 43 is nothing 
plausibly praiseworthy about his motives for the various wrongful acts, each of which 
involved hurtful words or behavior to a student, teacher, or staff member. 
 Because respondent refuses to acknowledge any wrongdoing, he 
demonstrated no remorse or rehabilitation and the likelihood that he would repeat the 
same or similar misconduct is very high. 
 No constitutional rights are implicated by this disciplinary action. 
Disposition 
19. The Commission on Professional Competence concludes that cause exists 
to dismiss respondent based on immoral conduct, unprofessional conduct, evident 
unfitness for service, and persistent violation of or refusal to obey school policies 
under section 44932, subdivisions (a)(1), (2), (6), and (8). Cause was not established to 
dismiss respondent for unsatisfactory performance under section 44932, subdivision 
(a)(5). The Commission reached this decision on a unanimous vote. Each ground for 
dismissal provides a .
