BEFORE THE 
OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 

In the Matter of the Accusation Against: 

CATHERINE MADSON (EN 800866), a 
Permanent Certificated Employee

Respondent. 

OAH No.  2014100514 

DECISION

Administrative Law Judge Angela Villegas (ALJ), State of California, Office of 

 
Administrative Hearings, heard this matter on September 1, 2015, in Los Angeles, 
California.1

Mampre R. Pomakian, Associate General Counsel for the Los Angeles Unified 

 
School District (LAUSD), represented complainant. 

Respondent and her attorney of record, Ronald C. Lapekas, declined to appear at the 

hearing.

Evidence was received, and the matter was submitted on September 1, 2015. 

INTRODUCTION; SUMMARY OF ISSUES 

Complainant seeks the dismissal of a tenured teacher, respondent Catherine Madson, 

 
on the following grounds:  

(1)  unprofessional conduct (Ed. Code,2 § 44932, subd. (a)(1));  
(2)  immoral conduct (§§ 44932, subd. (a)(1), and 44939);  

1 Ordinarily, a three-member commission on professional competence (commission) 

would preside over this proceeding involving teacher dismissal.  The parties, however, 
mutually waived their right to a commission, and the case was heard and decided by the ALJ 
alone.  (See Factual Finding 6.) 

2 All further statutory references are to the Education Code, unless otherwise 

indicated. 

1

(3)  evident unfitness for service (§ 44932, subd. (a)(5)); and 
(4)  persistent violation of state laws or regulations for the governance of 

schools (§ 44932, subd. (a)(7)). 

DENIAL OF PREHEARING MOTION TO DISMISS ACCUSATION 

On August 17, 2015, respondent filed a motion to dismiss the Accusation; on August 
21, 2015, complainant filed an opposition to the motion.  On August 24, 2015, the ALJ heard 
oral argument on the motion, and on August 28, 2015, issued an order denying the motion.  
Rather than reproduce that order in its entirety in this decision, after the hearing, the ALJ 
marked the order as exhibit 104, and hereby includes it in the record of these proceedings.  

MOTION TO AMEND TO CONFORM TO PROOF 

At the close of the hearing, complainant moved to amend certain factual allegations of 

 
the Accusation to conform to proof.  The motion was denied pursuant to section 44934, 
subdivision (d), and because of respondent’s absence from the hearing.  The ruling on the 
motion to amend did not affect the outcome of this proceeding. 

Parties and Jurisdiction 

FACTUAL FINDINGS 

1.  

Complainant Justo H. Avila, LAUSD’s Chief Human Resources Officer,

 
brought the Accusation in his official capacity.  Respondent filed a Notice of Defense.  This 
proceeding followed. 

2.   

Respondent is a certificated employee of LAUSD, and worked as a history 

 
teacher at Washington Preparatory High School (School) from November 2005 to January 
31, 2013, when she was removed from the classroom.  At the times relevant to this case, the 
School’s principal was Dr. Athaur Rahman “Todd” Ullah, and the assistant principals 
included Danny Kindle. 

3.  

On August 12, 2014, complainant executed a Statement of Charges against 

 
respondent and presented it to LAUSD’s governing board, which voted on August 26, 2014 
to terminate respondent’s employment.  

4.  

On September 16, 2014, LAUSD gave respondent written notice of its intent 

 
to dismiss her, and served her with a copy of the Statement of Charges.  On October 10, 
2014, respondent timely demanded a hearing, which led to the issuance of the Accusation. 

2

5.  

On November 8 and 10, 2014, by stipulation, the parties waived the “60-day 
 
rule” set forth in former section 44944, subdivision (a)(1),3 for commencing the hearing.   

6.  

In a subsequent stipulation dated August 19, 2015, the parties waived the right 

to convene a commission (§ 44944, subd. (c)(1); former § 44944, subd. (b)(1)), agreed to 
have the matter heard by an ALJ alone, and set forth respondent’s withdrawal of her Notice 
of Defense, and her intention not to appear or present a defense at the administrative 
hearing.4  In the August 19, 2015 stipulation, the parties also agreed that LAUSD could 
present evidence at the hearing by way of affidavit or declaration without regard to the prior-
notice requirements of Government Code section 11514. 

Findings on the Allegations Against Respondent 

7.  

The allegations of the Accusation/Statement of Charges5 concern events in 

respondent’s 10th-grade history classes on March 20, 2012; April 18, 2012; from the 
beginning of the 2012-2013 school year through October 26, 2012; and on January 31, 2013.   

 

 

MARCH 20, 2012 INCIDENTS AND AFTERMATH

8.    On March 20, 2012, the following events occurred. 

 

(a)   As alleged in paragraph 1(a) of the Accusation, respondent accused 

 
African-American students of failing to pay attention to a video, because the video’s subject 
matter was unrelated to African-American history, particularly slavery.   

 

(b)   Respondent stated, “This always happens to me in this course every 
 
year,” and went on to explain that “Hispanics begin to fail this [class] because they don’t 
want to listen to the truth,” or words to that effect, as alleged in paragraph 1(b) of the 
Accusation.  

 

 
students, approximately half of whom were African-American and half of whom were 

(c)   As alleged in paragraph 1(c) of the Accusation, respondent told her 

3 Effective January 1, 2015, the provisions of the Education Code governing teacher 
dismissal underwent a major revision, and many provisions were renumbered.  Because this 
case was brought under the former statutory scheme, this decision will, when necessary, refer 
to the former sections. 

4 The withdrawal of respondent’s Notice of Defense does not vitiate jurisdiction to 

proceed with the hearing.  Under Government Code section 11506, subdivision (c), failure to 
file a notice of defense (or, by extension, the withdrawal of same) waives the respondent’s 
right to a hearing, “but the agency in its discretion may nevertheless grant a hearing.”

5 Further references will be to the Accusation only, but such references also 

encompass the Statement of Charges. 

3

Latino, that “Hispanics” (Karina Rosa declaration (dec.) ¶ 9) did not know anything, and that 
the students were not going anywhere in life, would turn out to be “nobody” (id.), and would 
not go to college. 

 

(d)   Respondent told her students they would not be able to pass the 

 
California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE), as alleged in paragraph 1(d) of the 
Accusation. 

9.  

The evidence did not establish that on March 20, 2012, respondent “caused a 
 
student to leave her class in tears and refuse to return . . . because [respondent] always made 
the student feel bad with her racial comments about Mexicans and telling students that they 
would not succeed in life[,]” as alleged in paragraph 2 of the Accusation.  The evidence did 
suggest that a student from respondent’s class cried in March 2012, but did not establish that 
it was because of respondent’s racially-charged or discouraging remarks.   

10.   On March 26, 2012, Dr. Ullah “conferenced” (testimony of Dr. Ullah) with 
 
respondent concerning the March 20, 2012 incidents.6  During the conference, respondent 
denied making racial remarks, and complained that, although her purse had been stolen 
twice, the administration had done nothing to “back [her] up[.]”  (Ex. 18.)  She also stated, 
“Students push me and curse me every day and I just take it” (id.), and voiced her belief that 
the students were trying to get her fired. 

11.   Dr. Ullah instructed respondent to “[p]rovide a climate that promotes fairness, 

 
caring, equity, and respect in your classroom and toward your students”; “always be 
respectful in your treatment of others”; “cease and desist from discriminatory remarks in 
your classroom”; refrain from suggesting “that students are not capable of achieving their 
goals and dreams”; and follow LAUSD’s policies, including the Code of Ethics, Code of 
Conduct with Students, and a resolution calling for the respectful treatment of all persons.  
(Ex. 18.) 

 

APRIL 18, 2012 INCIDENT AND AFTERMATH

12.   On April 18, 2012, five to eight students from respondent’s class left the 

 
classroom eight to nine minutes prior to the end of class.  These facts, as established by the 
evidence, did not exactly correspond to the allegation of paragraph 3 of the Accusation that 
respondent “left five to eight students unsupervised in her classroom.”  Nevertheless, 
respondent’s conduct as established by the evidence had the same result as the conduct 
alleged: namely, five to eight students whom respondent was responsible for supervising 
were without her supervision. 
//
//
//

6 This instance of conferencing was not pled in the Accusation. 

4

13.   After this incident, Dr. Ullah conferenced with respondent regarding her 

instructional performance and concerns over student safety.7  During the conference, 
respondent again complained that her purse had been stolen twice, and that the 
administration could not “offer [her] physical safety[,]” and stated her belief that the students 
were dangerous.  (Ex. 21.) 

14.   Dr. Ullah provided respondent with the Stull Performance Indicators, on which  

 
her performance would be evaluated, and the California Standards for the Teaching 
Profession, along with materials to support her instructional performance.  Dr. Ullah likewise 
gave respondent instructional directives, and warned her, “You are never to allow students to 
leave before the school dismissal bell as it jeopardizes safety of the student and the campus 
instructional program.”  (Ex. 21.) 

INCIDENTS DURING THE 2012-2013 SCHOOL YEAR, INCLUDING OCTOBER 26, 2012,
AND AFTERMATH

 
15.   On unspecified dates from the beginning of the 2012-2013 school year through 
October 26, 2012, respondent told students they would fail her class; they were “crazy”; and 
she felt sorry for their parents, as alleged in paragraph 4 of the Accusation.  (Exs. 48, 49, 50, 
and 51.)8

 

16.   On October 26, 2012, the following events occurred. 

 

 
(a)   At the beginning of class, respondent chanted in a sing-song voice that 
she was “giving out referrals[,]”9 as alleged in paragraph 5 of the Accusation.  (Testimony of 
Drelin Lester; exs. 46 and 68.) 

 

(b)   After the chant, respondent used the word “fuck” in front of the class, 

 
stating, “What the fuck are they going to do?” or words to that effect, as alleged in paragraph 
6 of the Accusation.  (Testimony of Drelin Lester; exs. 45, 47, 68, and 69.) 
//
//

7 This instance of conferencing is not pled in the Accusation. 

8 The cited exhibits are unsworn student statements, which might have been 
vulnerable to a hearsay objection, but because respondent was not present, no objection was 
asserted.  Under Government Code section 11513, subdivision (d), “[h]earsay evidence may 
be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence, but over timely 
objection shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible 
over objection in civil actions.”  (Emphasis supplied.)  Since there was no objection, and no 
indication the students’ statements were unreliable, they formed the basis for this finding. 

9 “Referral” means a referral to the Dean of Students for purposes of student 

discipline.  (Testimony of Dr. Ullah.) 

5

 

(c)   Respondent ejected student S

 
from her physically, as alleged in paragraph 5 of the Accusation.  (Testimony of Drelin 
Lester; exs. 46-51, 54, and 68.) 

 R. from the class, pushing him away 

17.   On January 11, 2013, Dr. Ullah again conferenced with Respondent as a result 

 
of the October 26, 2012 incidents.  (Ex. 24.)  At the conference, respondent denied pushing 
S
 R. and denied using the word “fuck.”  Dr. Ullah warned respondent that it was 
inappropriate to “[p]ut your hands on a student and to push a student”; “use demeaning or 
derogatory language with students such as ‘fuck’”; and/or “call a student ‘crazy’ or any other 
demeaning term(s).”  (Id.)

18.   Dr. Ullah also provided respondent with copies of state and LAUSD 

regulations and policies on which all teachers, including respondent, had repeatedly received 
training.  These were the California Standards for the Teaching Profession, and LAUSD’s 
resolution regarding respectful treatment of all persons; Code of Conduct with Students; 
Employee Code of Ethics; and Discipline Foundation Policy.  Dr. Ullah also referred 
respondent to LAUSD’s Employee Assistance Program, in case she desired counseling.   

19.  

In addition, Dr. Ullah directed respondent not to push students out of class; not 

to use demeaning or derogatory language, such as the word “fuck,” with them; to use 
appropriate discipline techniques; and to follow the LAUSD policies noted above, as well as 
the policy abolishing corporal punishment. 

JANUARY 31, 2013 INCIDENT AND AFTERMATH  

20.   On January 31, 2013, after student T

 
believing he had stolen her keys or phone, chased him and tackled or grabbed him, and 
engaged in mutual pushing and shoving with him in the hallway and stairwell outside her 
classroom, as alleged in paragraph 8 of the Accusation.  As a result of the altercation, T
P. sustained scratches to both of his arms, and another student, K
intervene, sustained scratches to her chest, as alleged in paragraph 8 of the Accusation. 

 P. left the classroom, respondent, 

 
 M., who had tried to 

21.   The evidence did not establish the antecedents to the January 31, 2013 

 
altercation.   

(a)  

The evidence did not establish that respondent “snatched a paper from 

the hands of student T
evidence, in the form of unsworn student statements, that respondent snatched a paper away 
from another student, likely K

 P.[,]” as alleged in paragraph 7 of the Accusation.  There was 

 M.  (Exs. 58, 61, and 63.) 

(b)   The evidence did not establish that respondent more likely than not 
 
 
“told [T
 P.] to get out of the classroom,” as alleged in paragraph 7 of the Accusation.
Three unsworn student statements (exs. 55, 56 and 63,10 and 58) indicated that respondent 

10 Exhibits 56 and 63 are duplicates. 

6

did so, but the testimony of Drelin Lester, and the declaration (¶ 5) and statement (exs. 44 
and 64)11 of Tiyesha Watts, along with four other student statements (exs. 52, 61, 62, 64), 
indicated that T

 P. simply “walked out” of the room. 

(c)  

 
 P.] into the hallway” outside the classroom, as alleged in paragraph 7 of the 

Likewise, the evidence did not establish that respondent “pushed 

 
[T
Accusation .   

22.  

Following the January 31, 2013 incident, respondent was removed from the 

 
classroom and did not return.  A police report was taken, but no criminal repercussions 
followed.  On February 27, 2013, Dr. Ullah conferenced with respondent again.  This time, 
respondent remained silent. 

23.   Dr. Ullah informed respondent again that “[i]t is inappropriate [to] put your 
 
hands on a student and to push a student[,]” and directed her not to do so.  He also directed 
her not to push students out of class, not to use demeaning or derogatory language with 
students, to seek administrative assistance if the situation recurred, and to follow LAUSD 
policies with regard to the treatment of others, including students.  (Ex. 26.) 

 

OTHER MATTERS CONCERNING RESPONDENT’S CONDUCT

24.  

In addition to the matters alleged in the Accusation, the evidence also 

 
indicated respondent’s teaching methods were ineffective and failed to engage students, and 
that she frequently talked to herself during class, used profanity, and evicted students from 
the classroom. 

25.   Dr. Ullah perceived respondent, during his conferences with her, to be 

 
defensive, argumentative, and at times irrational.  Dr. Ullah’s view, supported by 
respondent’s statements as recounted in conference memoranda (exs. 18, 21, and 24), was 
that respondent largely blamed the students for the things that went wrong in her classroom. 

RESPONDENT’S VIOLATION OF LAUSD RULES AND REGULATIONS; IMPACT OF 
RESPONDENT’S BEHAVIOR

(a)  

26.  

 
The LAUSD faculty handbook in effect at the times relevant to this 
case (ex. 27) was provided to all teachers, including respondent, at the beginning of each 
school year.   

(b)  

It directed teachers to help students develop respect for their own 

cultural heritage and that of others, “a sense of ethics and moral character in their decision-
making process[,]” and “appropriate techniques for conflict resolution.”  (Id. at p. 3.)
Among the professional duties specified for teachers was “[s]upervising pupils both within 
and outside the classroom[.]”  (Id. at p. 11.) Moreover, teachers were made “responsible for 

11 Exhibits 44 and 64 are duplicates. 

7

the general conduct of pupils both inside the classroom and on the grounds.  Discipline cases 
needing special attention should be referred to the dean’s office.”  (Id. at p. 12.)  Finally, 
teachers’ roles and responsibilities included “model[ing] respectful communication, mature 
decision-making and life-long learning skills along with teaching the course content.”  (Id. at 
p. 46.) 

(c)

Respondent’s conduct from March 2012 through January 2013, as 

described in Factual Findings 7 through 23, contravened these provisions of the handbook.  
In particular, respondent’s attribution of poor classroom conduct or academic performance to 
students’ ethnicities was disrespectful and showed poor judgment; her failure to keep 
students from leaving class exposed them and others to danger, as did her physical 
aggression toward students as a means of discipline.  The impression created by respondent’s 
conduct was one of disrespect, lawlessness, and immaturity in problem-solving. 

27.   The Stull Performance Indicators (ex. 29) are the criteria that guided 

performance evaluations of faculty at the School during the times relevant to this case.  
Those indicators included, under Classroom Performance, that the teacher “[m]odel[ ] and 
promote[ ] fairness, caring, equity and respect” (id., ¶ 3(c)), and “maintain[ ] a safe learning 
environment.”  (Id., ¶ 3(f).)   Respondent’s conduct did not accord with these Performance 
Indicators. 

28.  

(a)  

LAUSD’s Code of Conduct with Students (ex. 76), which had also 

been provided to respondent, prohibited “[m]aking statements, or comments, either directly 
or in the presence of student(s), which are not age-appropriate, professional, or which may be 
considered sexual in nature, harassing, or demeaning.”  (Id., ¶ 5.)  Respondent’s use of the 
word “fuck” in class was not age-appropriate or professional, and her attribution of poor 
classroom conduct or academic performance to students’ ethnicities was both harassing and 
demeaning. 

 

(b)   The Code of Conduct with Students likewise prohibited “[t]ouching or 

 
having physical contact with a student(s) that is not age-appropriate or within the scope of 
the employee’s/individual’s responsibilities and/or duties.”  (Id., ¶ 6.)  Respondent’s physical 
contact with S

 P. contravened this provision. 

 R. and T

29.   Effective October 15, 1984, LAUSD’s Board of Education abolished corporal 

 
punishment.  On July 5, 2012, LAUSD issued bulletin BUL-5747.0 reaffirming that 
abolition, and defining corporal punishment as “the intentional application of physical pain 
as a method of changing behavior.”  (Ex. 78.)  Teachers were made aware of this policy, 
which respondent’s physical confrontation with T

 P. violated. 

30.   The California Standards for the Teaching Profession, issued by the California 

 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing, required that teachers “[e]stablish a climate that 
promotes fairness and respect[.]”  (Ex. 81, Standard 4.)  Respondent was made aware of this 
standard, yet her conduct failed to meet it. 

8

31.   On October 10, 1988, the LAUSD Board of Education enacted a resolution 

 
mandating that all employees “treat all persons equally and respectfully and refrain from the 
willful or negligent use of slurs against any person on the basis of race, . . . color,  . . . 
national origin, [or] immigration status.”  (Ex. 82.)  Respondent was also made aware of this 
resolution.  Her attribution of poor classroom conduct or academic performance to students’ 
ethnicities violated it. 

32.   On March 27, 2007, LAUSD issued its Discipline Foundation Policy bulletin, 

 
no. BUL-3638.0, and respondent was made aware of it.  Teacher responsibilities under the 
Discipline Foundation Policy included “[a]cknowledging and reinforcing appropriate student 
behavior[,]” while “[p]roving corrective feedback and re-teaching the behavioral skill when 
misconduct occurs[,]” and “[r]eporting the behavior to the school administrator . . . for a 
student who engages in ongoing misconduct, despite appropriate interventions.”  (Ex. 84, pp. 
3-4.)  Respondent’s conduct, as found above, especially her physical contact with S
and T

 P., failed to fulfill these responsibilities. 

 R. 

33.   The LAUSD Employee Code of Ethics, of which respondent was also made 

 
aware, required teachers to “[c]reate an environment of trust, respect and non-
discrimination” (ex. 83, ¶ A(2)), follow LAUSD “policies, procedures and rules” (id., ¶ 
A(5)), and “[m]aintain appropriate relationships with students”: i.e., “relationships [that] are 
positive, professional and non-exploitive.”  (Id., ¶ B(11).)  Respondent’s conduct failed to 
create an environment of trust, respect, and non-discrimination; her physical contact with 
S
the LAUSD policies, procedures and rules previously discussed. 

 P. was neither positive nor professional; and her conduct also violated 

 R. and T

34.  

In connection with respondent’s conduct on March 20, 2012, October 26, 

 
2012, and January 31, 2013, administrators investigated by discussing the events with 
students, and having students write statements.  On occasion, students had to be pulled from 
classes, including respondent’s and other teachers’, for these investigative purposes.  As a 
result, students missed instructional time.  In addition, respondent’s conduct endangered 
students’ physical and emotional well-being.  The January 31, 2013 incident, which occurred 
outside respondent’s classroom, was also disruptive and required police involvement.  
Respondent’s behavior consistently alarmed, puzzled, dismayed, and confused her students.
(Testimony of Drelin Lester and Sky Rice.) 

35.  

Since respondent did not participate in the hearing, she did not present 
 
evidence of mitigating or extenuating circumstances, or of her rehabilitation since the 
incidents described above. 

LEGAL CONCLUSIONS 

1.  

 
in her Motion to Dismiss the Accusation.  (§§ 44934; 44934; and 44944, subd. (d)(2); former 

Jurisdiction exists to proceed, despite respondent’s contention to the contrary 

9

§§ 44934; 44939; and 44944, subd. (c)(2).)  The reasons for denying respondent’s Motion to 
Dismiss the Accusation are as stated in the ruling on that motion.  (Ex. 104.) 

2.  

Complainant had the burden to establish the matters alleged in the Accusation 

 
by a preponderance of the evidence.  (Gardner v. Com. on Prof. Competence (1985) 164 
Cal.App.3d 1035, 1038-1040.) 

3.  

Complainant established that respondent should be dismissed from her 

 
teaching position with LAUSD, on grounds that she engaged in immoral conduct, showed 
evident unfitness for service, and persistently violated school regulations.   

Unprofessional Conduct 

4. 

Complainant established that respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct (§ 

 
44932, subd. (a)(2); former § 44932, subd. (a)(1)), but did not establish that the 
unprofessional conduct constitutes cause for dismissal in this case. 

5.

“Unprofessional conduct” is that which violates the rules or ethical code of a 

profession, or is unbecoming of a member of a profession in good standing (Bd. of Education 
v. Swan (1953) 41 Cal.2d 546, 553 [overruled on other grounds, Bekiaris v. Bd. of Education
(1972) 6 Cal.3d 575, 588, fn. 7]), and indicates unfitness to teach.  (Perez v. Com. on Prof. 
Competence (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1167, 1174.)   

6.  

Respondent’s conduct on March 20, 2012, April 18, 2012, from the beginning 

 
of the 2012-2013 school year through October 26, 2012, and on January 31, 2013, was 
unbecoming of a teacher in good standing and violated school regulations, because it 
discouraged students, put them down, threatened them with arbitrary punishment, involved 
the use of profanity, and included inappropriate physical contact with students and the 
eviction of a student from class.  (Factual Findings 8-20 and 26-33.)  Moreover, since all of 
the conduct described above occurred during class and directly involved respondent’s 
interaction with students, it reflected on her fitness to teach.   

7.    Nevertheless, it was not established that respondent was given notice of her 

unsatisfactory conduct in time to give her a chance to cure it.  The Accusation and 
complainant’s exhibit list refer to a Notice of Unsatisfactory Acts dated March 27, 2014, but 
no such notice was actually presented at the hearing, and even if it had been, March 27, 2014 
was more than a year after respondent had been removed from the classroom.  (Factual 
Findings 2 and 22.) 

8.

LAUSD’s failure to provide respondent with timely notice of her 
unsatisfactory acts and an opportunity to cure is fatal to the unprofessional conduct claim.  (§ 
44938, subd. (a); former § 44938, subd. (a); Woodland Joint Unified School Dist. v. Com. on 
Prof. Competence (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1429 (Woodland), 1446; Tarquin v. Com. on Prof. 
Competence (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 251, 257-259.)   

10

Immoral Conduct 

9.  

 
44932, subd. (a)(1); 44939).   

Complainant established that respondent engaged in immoral conduct (§§ 

10.  

“Immoral conduct” includes conduct hostile to the welfare of the general 

 
public, conduct that is willful, flagrant, or shameless, and conduct showing moral 
indifference to the opinions of respectable members of the community, and an inconsiderate 
attitude toward good order and the public welfare.  (Bd. of Education of the San Francisco 
Unified School District v. Weiland (1960) 179 Cal. App.2d 808, 811.)   

11.   Respondent’s physical aggression toward S

 
 P., 
was immoral, because it was contrary to public welfare, demonstrated utter inconsideration 
of good order, and reflected indifference to the opinions of anyone else.  (Factual Finding 
20.) Again, respondent’s conduct occurred in class, in front of students, and involved 
students, leaving no doubt that it was related to her fitness to teach. 

 R., and especially T

Evident Unfitness for Service 

12.   Complainant established respondent’s evident unfitness for service (§ 44932, 

 
subd. (a)(6); former § 44932, subd. (a)(5)). 

13.  A teacher displaying “evident unfitness for service” is one who is “clearly not 
 
fit, not adapted to or unsuitable for teaching, ordinarily by reason of temperamental defects 
or inadequacies.  Unlike unprofessional conduct, evident unfitness for service connotes a 
fixed character trait, presumably not remediable merely on receipt of notice that one’s
conduct fails to meet the expectations of the employing school district.”  (Woodland, supra,
2 Cal.App.4th at p. 1444 [footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted].)   

14.   Respondent’s conduct on March 20, 2012, April 18, 2012, during the 
 
beginning of the 2012-2013 school year, on October 26, 2012, and on January 31, 2013, 
taken as a whole, reflects a persistent failure to modulate her behavior with students or 
employ appropriate means of motivation and discipline.  (Factual Findings 8, 12, 15, 16, and 
20.) Respondent’s inappropriate conduct, including the use of physical coercion, continued 
despite warnings to her that it must stop (Factual Findings 8 and 10-20), indicating that she 
was temperamentally unable or unwilling to correct her behavior.  Accordingly, respondent’s 
conduct indicates she is unfit to teach.   

15.   Moreover, although some of the conduct supporting this charge was verbal in 

nature, cause for discipline nevertheless exists despite respondent’s free-expression rights, 
because LAUSD may, at least to a degree, regulate respondent’s speech on the job.  (Garcetti
v. Ceballos (2006) 547 U.S. 410, 421 (Garcetti); Kaye v. Bd. of Trustees of San Diego 
County Public Law Library (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 48, 56-59 (Kaye).)

Persistent Violation of School Regulations 

16.   Complainant established respondent’s “[p]ersistent violation of or refusal to 

 
obey the school laws of the state or reasonable regulations prescribed for the government of 
the public schools by the state board or by the governing board of the school district 
employing him or her.”  (§ 44932, subd. (a)(8); former § 44932, subd. (a)(7).) 

17.   A teacher may be dismissed under this provision for continuous or repeated 

 
disobedience of applicable rules and regulations, or behavior motivated by an attitude of 
continuing insubordination; a single instance of disobedience is insufficient.  (Governing Bd. 
of the Oakdale Union School Dist. v. Seaman (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 77, 81-82.)   

18.   Respondent’s conduct on March 20, 2012, April 18, 2012, during the 
 
beginning of the 2012-2013 school year, on October 26, 2012, and on January 31, 2013, 
repeatedly violated state and LAUSD regulations, as set forth in Factual Findings 26 through 
33. Respondent’s violations endured over a period lasting almost two years, and occurred 
despite admonitions to desist.  (Factual Findings 8-34.)  Accordingly, respondent persistently 
violated, or refused to obey, school regulations. 

Respondent’s Conduct Constituting Cause for Dismissal Was Substantially Related to Her 
Fitness to Teach 

19.   Respondent’s immoral conduct, evident unfitness to teach, and persistent 

 
violations of school regulations are substantially related to the qualifications, functions, and 
duties of a teacher.  (Morrison v. State Board of Education (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214 (Morrison),
229-230.)

20.  

(a)   Respondent’s conduct adversely affected her students and fellow 

teachers to a serious degree.  (Morrison, supra, at p. 229.)   

(b)

Respondent’s negative remarks about her students’ potential for 

success and their ethnic backgrounds were discouraging and demeaning.  (Factual Finding 8 
and 15.)  Respondent’s failure to stop students from leaving her class early endangered them 
and others.  (Factual Finding 12.)  It also undermined good order and respect, as did her use 
of profanity in class and her threat of arbitrary punishment.  (Factual Finding 16.)  
Respondent’s displays of physical aggression toward students endangered them physically 
and alarmed them.  (Factual Findings 16, 20, and 34.)  The need for investigation into 
respondent’s conduct disrupted instructional time, and respondent’s students were left 
bewildered by her conduct.  (Factual Finding 34.) 

21.   Respondent’s conduct occurred recently, during 2012 and 2013, which was 

 
less than seven years into her teaching career at the School.  (Factual Findings 2 and 8-23.)  
(Morrison, supra, at p. 229.)  Moreover, her displays of physical aggression escalated over 
that time period.  (Factual Findings 16 and 20.)   

12

22.   Respondent’s conduct was aggravated by its persistent and repeated nature, 

 
and by the cruelty embodied in much of it.  (Factual Findings 8-23.)  (Morrison, supra, at p. 
229.) Some extenuating circumstances appeared: for example, respondent’s claim that her 
purse had been stolen twice, and that she had been physically threatened and bullied by 
students.  (Factual Findings 10 and 13.)  Nevertheless, respondent’s response to those 
circumstances was immature and made the situation worse rather than better.  Moreover, it 
was not clear that the bad things that had happened to respondent in the past involved the 
same group, or groups, of students on whom she visited her uncalled-for behavior.   

(a)  

23.  

The motivations for respondent’s conduct were not always clear.  (See 
 
Morrison, supra, at p. 229 [identifying as a factor to be considered “the praiseworthiness or 
blameworthiness of the motives resulting in the conduct”].)  

(b)

It was possible that some of respondent’s conduct could have had a 

praiseworthy motive, but even if it did, her behavior still showed insensitivity and poor 
judgment, and it was not understood as positive.  (Factual Findings 8-20 and 34.) 

 

(c)   Moreover, there could have been no praiseworthy motive for 

 P. on January 31, 2013.  (Factual Findings 16 and 20.)  Respondent’s 

 
respondent’s use of profanity in class on October 26, 2012, or for her physical aggression 
toward T
motivation in the latter instance was her belief that T
Finding 20.)  But especially in a school setting, it was wholly inappropriate for respondent to 
resort to self-help and physical violence, particularly considering that she was not being 
physically threatened.  (Factual Findings 20 and 21.)  On the contrary, respondent was the 
aggressor.  (Id.)

 P. had stolen her keys.  (Factual 

24.   Given the repeated nature of respondent’s conduct (Factual Findings 8-20) and 

 
the absence of any showing of rehabilitation (Factual Finding 35), the likelihood of 
recurrence is high.  (Morrison, supra, at p. 229.) 

25.   Although some of the conduct constituting cause for dismissal was verbal 

 
(Factual Findings 8 and 15), there is little concern that imposing discipline will “inflict an 
adverse impact or chilling effect upon the constitutional rights of the teacher involved or 
other teachers.”  (Morrison, supra, at p. 229.)  As already noted, Garcetti and Kaye, supra,
both decided after Morrison, indicate that some “chilling” is permissible in public 
employment, and in the public schools, it is important that teachers recognize their students’ 
sensitivity and avoid hurtful and profane language. 

26.   All of these factors, considered together, strongly indicate that respondent is 

 
no longer fit for her position as an LAUSD teacher. 

Dismissal Is Appropriate

27.  

 
(c)(1), provide that the only options available to a commission (or in this case, to the ALJ), 

Section 44944, subdivision (d)(1), and former section 44944, subdivision 

13

are dismissal or non-dismissal.12  The commission (or here, the ALJ) has no power to impose 
probation or other lesser sanctions.  (§ 44944, subd. (d)(3); former § 44944, subd. (c)(3).) 

28.  

In this case, the Accusation seeks to have respondent “dismissed from her 

 
employment as a permanent certificated employee” of LAUSD.  (Accusation, prayer ¶ 2.)  
Suspension is not sought.  Hence, the only available options are either to dismiss respondent 
or retain her.

29.   Given complainant’s establishment of three causes for dismissal, and the 

 
absence of any showing of rehabilitation or other countervailing considerations, the 
appropriate consequence for respondent’s conduct is dismissal from her teaching position.
