On  August  22,  2017,  the  Assistant  Chief  Human  Resources  Officer,  Jose  R. 

Canto,  Ed.D,  signed  the  Statement  of  Charges  in  his  official  capacity.  The  Statement  of

unsatisfactory  performance,  evident  unfitness  for  service,  persistent  violation  or  refusal  to 
obey  school  and/or  district  rules,  and  willful  refusal  to  perform  regular  assignments  without

Respondent  tumely  served  a  Notice  of  Defense,  which  Respondent  amended  on 

Chavez  Social  Justice  Humanitas  Academy 

4A. 

Humanitas  is  a  pilot  school  m  the  LAUSD  system.  Pursuant  to  the 

Memorandum  of  Understandmg  (MOU}  between  LAUSD  and  the  United  Teachers  Los 
Angeles  CUTLA),  the  working  conditions  m  pilot  schools  must  comply  with  all  state  and 
federal  law  and  regulations  but  are  generally  exempt  from  Board  Rules,  District  policies  and 
the  provisions  of  the  LAUSD-UTLA  collective  bargaming  agreement  (CBA). 

5. 

The  provisions  of  the  CBA  which  expressly  apply  to  pilot  schools  include 
provisions  related  to  the  status  of  LAUSD  employees  who  work  tm  pilot  schools,  leaves 
(Article  ALD,  reduction  m  force  (Article  XUD,  evaluations  and  disciplme  (Article  X  and 
Article  XX VU,  Section  3.2),  peer  assistance  and  review  (Article  X-A),  dues  deduction 
(Article  [1V-A),  safety  (Article  XA  VIL),  holidays  (Article  XVID),  and  UTLA  rights  (selected 
provisions  of  Article  PV). 

6. 

Article  EX  outlines  the  hours,  determines  the  hours,  duties,  and  work  year, 

including  the  mimimum  on-site  obligations  of  teachers.  Pursuant  to  the  MOU,  Article  TX  is 
superseded  by  a  pilot  school’s  Elect-to-Work  Agreement  (EWA).  Employees  sign  the 
agreement  as  a  condition  of  working  at  a  Pilot  School. 

7. 

When  Respondent  was  hired,  Humanitas  was  developing  a  full  inclusion 

model  of  special  education  where  students  with  disabilities  receive  their  education  within  the 
regular  classroom  assisted  by  RSP  teachers  who  would  enter  the  classroom  and  provide 
support  as  needed. 

8. 

During  the  2015/2016  school  year,  Respondent  was  not  formally  assigned  to  a 
class  but  she  had  a  caseload  of  students.  During  the  2016/2017,  Respondent  was  assigned  an 
advisory  class. 

9, 

For  each  of  the  students  in  her  caseload,  Respondent  was  required  to  obtain 
information  and  data  in  preparation  for  a  team  meeting  to  discuss  and  prepare  the  student’s 
Individualized  Education  Program  (LEP)  pursuant  to  state  and  federal  laws  and  in  accordance 
with  school  district  policies  and  procedures.  Respondent  was  responsible  for  obtaming, 
collating,  and  reviewing  mformation  regarding  the  current  services  and  supports  bemg 
provided  to  the  students,  assessments,  their  levels  of  educational  performance,  and  progress 
towards  the  goals  and  objectives  under  ther  LEPs.  Completion  of  these  special  education 
tasks  required  Respondent  to  confer  with  the  student's  general  education  teachers  and  service 
providers.  She  was  also  required  to  notify  school  staff)  service  providers,  the  student’s 
parents,  and  other  mandatory  participants  of  the  date  and  location  of  the  LEP  team  meeting 
where  participants  could  discuss  the  pupil’s  special  education  program,  determime  necessary 
services  and  supports,  and  prepare  and  sign  the  LEP  document.  After  or  during  the  TEP  team

employee  is  paid  for  a  leave  of  absence  due  to  illness.  According  to  Section  12.7,  “[w]hen 
an  employee  is  absent  under  this  section  and  such  absence  is  properly  verified,  the  employee 
will  receive  full  normal  pay  up  to  the  total  of  the  employee’s  full-pay  illness.”  Section  12.7 
requires  employees  to  certify  the  reason  for  the  absence  and  authorizes  the  District  to  use 
whatever  means  reasonably  necessary  to  verify  any  claimed  illness  before  authorizing  any 
compensation.  Additionally,  Section  12.7,  requires  employees  who  are  absent  from  duty  for 
more  than  five  consecutive  working  days  to  submit  a  signed  Certification/Request  of 
Absence  for  Illness,  Family  Illness,  New  Child  (Form  60.ILL)  (Certification  of  Absence)

Article  XII,  sections  14.0-14.1,  outlines  the  circumstances  when  an  employee 

is  paid  for  a  leave  of  absence  due  to  personal  necessity.  Employees  are  required  to  “notify 
the  immediate  administrator  at  least  five  working  days  prior  to  the  absence”  (Section  14.0, 
subdivision  (m)),  to  verify  the  nature  of  the  necessity,  and  not  to  take  more  than  six  personal 
necessity  absences  a  year.”  (Article  XII,  section  14.1.)

which  outlines  the  length  of  the  instructional  and  work  day,  the  amount  of  time  or 
responsibilities  an  employee  is  required  to  render  beyond  the  instructional  day,  and  any 
additional  required  duty  time  outside  the  school  year.

after  the  instructional  start  time,  it  1s  considered  to  be  a  partial  absence.  SAA  Jimenez  is 
charged  with  monitoring  the  sign-in  book  and  logs.  The  sign-in  book  is  kept  in  the  main 
office.  After  the  8:00  a.m.  start  time,  the  sign-in  book  is  removed  and  replaced  with  the  late

On  March  16,  2016,  Assistant  Principal  Marike  Aguilar  (nee  Marike  Anderson 

Dam)  (AP  Aguilar)  had  an  informal  meeting  with  Respondent  to  address  certain  concerns, 
including  Respondent’s  attendance.  A  conference  was  scheduled  the  following  day  to 
discuss  these  concerns  in  detail. 

19. 

Respondent  requested  that  it  be  rescheduled  as  Respondent’s  UTLA 

representative  would  not  be  available  on  the  day  of  the  conference.  AP  Aguilar  rescheduled 
the  conference  to  accommodate  Respondent's  request  to  March  29,  2016  at  4:30  pam.  On  the 
day  of  the  conference,  however,  AP  Aguilar  had  a  confrontation  with  Respondent  regarding 
the  conference  where  Respondent  came  “really  close”  to  AP  Aguilar  and  told  her  that  she 
needed  to  change  the  time  of  the  conference.  When  AP  Aguilar  advised  Respondent  that  she 
would  not  be  changimg  the  time  of  the  conference,  Respondent  stated  that  it  would  become  a 
union  matter.  AP  Aguilar  acknowledged  Respondent’s  statement  and  walked  away,  shaken 
by  the  encounter. 

20. 

When  Respondent  did  not  attend  the  conference  at  the  scheduled  time,  the 

conference  was  held  in  in  her  absence  and  a  summary  of  the  administration’s  concerns  (April 
2016  Memorandum)  was  provided  to  Respondent.  Details  regarding  Respondent's  absences

been  absent  on  12  occasions  and  had  arrived  late  to  work  30  times.  AP  Aguilar  noted  that 
her  “frequent  absences  have  a  negative  impact  on  parents,  students  and  staff  who  have 
meetings  scheduled  with  [her]  on  these  days;  students  [she  is]  scheduled  to  support  in  class 
on  these  days;  [and]  students  who  would  otherwise  make  use  of  the  Learning  Center”  and 
directed  Respondent  to  “report  to  work  on  time,  every  day,  and  work  for  the  duration  of  [her] 
contract  hours.”  (Exhibit  7D,  LAUSD  138  and  139).  AP  Aguilar  provided  Respondent  with

Respondent  that  absences  due  to  illness  or  personal  necessity  are  not  protected  unless  they 
are  covered  by  the  Family  Medical  Leave  Act  (FMLA),  and  that,  “if  applicable,  [Respondent 
was]  to  return  the  completed  forms  to  [her]  no  later  than  Friday,  April  8,  2016.°  CExhibit  7D,

23. 

Respondent  prepared  and  submitted  a  response  to  the  April  2016 
Memorandum  (Apri  2016  Response)  and  addressed  its  many  concerns.  With  respect  to  her 
attendance,  Respondent  admitted  to  the  absences,  stating  that  her  absences  had  been  due  to 
either  her  or  her  children  being  ill.  With  respect  to  the  late  arrivals,  Respondent  stated  that 
“over  two-thirds  of  those  tardies”  was  due  to  the  LAUSD  bus  transportation  running  behind 
schedule.  (Exhibit  7D,  LAUSD  144  and  Exhibit  562,  JSC  202.)  Respondent  concluded  by 
agreeing  to  follow  the  directives  related  to  attendance,  including,  submitting  verifications  for

May  26-27,  2016;  June  8-9,  2016;  and  June  13,  2016.  Respondent’s  absences  following  the 
April  2016  Memorandum  constituted  a  violation  of  administrative  directives  that  Respondent 
report  to  work  on  time,  every  day,  and  work  for  the  duration  of  her  contract  hours  and 
constitutes  a  willful  refusal  to  perform  a  regular  assignment  without  reasonable  cause.

Based  on  Findings  16-17,  23-24,  26-27,  29-30  above,  it  was  established  that 

Respondent  was  either  tardy  or  partially  absent  on  41  occasions.  Parties  stipulated  that 
Respondent  was  either  tardy  or  partially  absent  on  14  occasions.  In  addition  to  the  stipulated 
dates,  the  District  established  that  Respondent  was  either  tardy  or  partially  absent  on  27 
additional  occasions:  September  1-2,  2015;  September  10,  2015;  September  25,  2105; 
October  23,  2015;  October  27,  2015;  November  13,  2015;  November  15,  2015;  November

June  1,  2016;  June  6-7,  2016;  and  June  10,  2016.  Respondent’s  tardiness  and  partial 
absences  during  the  2015/2016  school  year  constituted  a  violation  of  the  EWA  provision 
governing  working  hours.  Respondent’s  continued  tardiness  and  partial  absences  following 
the  April  2016  Memorandum  constituted  a  violation  of  administrative  directives  that 
Respondent  report  to  work  on  time,  every  day,  and  work  for  the  duration  of  her  contract 
hours  and  constitutes  a  willful  refusal  to  perform  a  regular  assignment  without  reasonable 
cause.

CERTIFICATIONS  AND  VERIFICATIONS 

33. 

Article  XH,  Section  12.7  provides  that  when  an  employee  is  absent  due  to 

iliness  and  “such  absence  is  properly  verified,  the  employee  will  receive  full  normal  pay  up 
to  the  total  of  the  employee’s  full-pay  ness  benefits.” 

34. 

Pursuant  Section  12.8  of  Article  XU  of  the  CBA,  “An  employee  who  ts  absent 

shall  be  required  to  certify  the  reason  for  absence.” 

38. 

Article  XU,  Section  14.1,  subsection  (d),  requires  that  the  employee  “... 

verify  the  nature  of  such  necesstty.  Such  statement  shall  be  filed  with  the  appropriate 
administrator  no  less  than  five  working  days  in  advance  of a  religious  holiday,  court 
appearance  or  school  visitation...” 

36. 

Humanitas  requires  that  certifications  be  submitted  the  next  day  the  employee 

is  back  at  work.  Verifications,  when  required,  are  to  be  submitted  along  with  the 
certification. 

37. 

 UTLA  area  representative  Rim  McLaughlin  testified  credibly  at  hearing.  Ms. 
McLaughlin  has  been  with  UTLA  for  approximately  eight  years.  As  an  area  representative, 
Ms.  McLaughlin  works  to  enforce  the  contract,  advise  members  on  questions  about  the 
contract,  organize  at  the  schools,  and  represent  members  in  contract  disputes  and 
conferences. 

38. 

Ms.  McLaughlin  has  represented  Respondent  at  Humanitas,  attending  several 

conferences  at  the  school  with  her,  and  filing  two  suspension  appeals  and  a  payroll  grievance 
on  her  behalf. 

39. 

According  to  Ms.  McLaughlin,  teachers  are  required  to  certify  absences  but 

there  is  no  time  period  specified  in  the  CBA  as  to  when  a  teacher  is  to  provide  such 
certification.  There  is  also  no  prohibition  in  the  contract  which  would  prevent  a  teacher  from 
providing  such  certifications  by  facsimile  or  e-mail  but  Ms.  McLaughiim  did  acknowledge 
that  some  schools  do  require  original  signatures.  Physician  certifications  are  required  by  the 
CBA  when  an  employee  has  been  absent  for  five  days, 

40. 

Ms.  MclLaughin  also  testified  that,  although  the  CBA  does  not  require 

certification  forms  for  tardies,  she  is  aware  of  occasions  when  employees  have  been  required 
to  submit  such  certifications  when  there  have  been  issues  related  to  attendance. 

41. 

twas  not  established  that  Respondent  failed  to  submit  a  Certification  and/or 

Request  for  Absence  for  Non-fliness  (orm  No.  60,  NON-LLL}  or  a  Certification/Request  for 
Absence  for  Uness  (Form  No.  60.  ILL)  (certification  forms)  for  absences  which  took  place 
between  the  period  beginning  with  October  21,  2015  and  endimg  on  May  17,  2016.  Though 
section  12.8  of  Article  XII  of  the  CBA  requires  employees  to  certify  the  reason  for  the 
absence,  the  Districtdid  not  present  any  evidence  of  Respondent's  fatlure  to  submit  the

proper  certification  forms  for  her  absences  during  this  period.  None  of  the  memoranda 
issued  to  Respondent  during  the  2015/2016  school  indicate  that  Respondent  failed  to  submit 
certifications  for  her  absences  or  the  dates  on  which  those  certifications  were  missing.  The 
District  also  did  not  submit  any  testimonial  evidence  that  Respondent  was  missing 
certification  forms  for  her  absences  during  the  2015/2016  school  year  and  the  days  for  which 
those  certifications  forms  were  missing.  Though  the  October  2016  Notice  of Satisfactory 
Act  (October  2016  Notice)  does  allege  the  dates  on  which  Respondent  purportedly  failed  to 
subnit  certification  forms  for  her  absences,  there  was  no  testimony  or  evidence  to  establish 
how  the  dates  were  determined  and  cannot  be  used  to  establish  these  violations.  Therefore, 
no  probative  evidence  was  presented  on  this  allegation. 

42. 

Absences  due  to  illness  and  personal  necessity  need  to  be  verified  pursuant  to 

In  addition,  Respondent  was  directed  to  verify  her 

Article  XH,  Section  12.7  and  14.1. 
absences  in  each  of  the  memoranda  issued  to  Respondent  during  the  2015/2016  school  vear 
by  the  Humanitas’  administration.  Respondent  agreed  to  follow  the  directive  to  verify  her 
absences,  her  April  2016  Response,  May  2016  Response  and  fine  2016  Response.  Despite 
this  obligation  to  verify  her  absences,  Respondent  failed  to  provide  Humanitas’ 
administration  with  acceptable  verifications  for  her  absences  of  April  5-6,  2016;  April  11, 
2016;  April  26-28,  2016:  May  5-6,  2016;  May  16-17,  2016;  May  26-27,  2016;  June  8-9, 
2016;  and  June  13,2016.  Respondent’s  failure  to  provide  verifications  of  her  absences  was  a 
violation  of  her  duties  under  CBA.  Respondent's  continued  failure  to  submit  acceptable 
verifications  after  being  issued  the  April  2016  Memorandum  constituted  a  violation  of 
administrative  directives  provided  to  Respondent  that  she  properly  verify  her  absences  tn 
order  to  be  paid. 

43. 

The  District  alleged  that,  during  the  period  between  May  2,  2016,  and  June  6, 

2016,  Respondent  failed  to  submit  valid  verifications  for  her  partial  absences  of  May  2, 
2016,  May  20,  2016,  May  25,  2016  and  June  6,  2016.  Though  it  was  established  Respondent 
failed  to  submit  valid  verifications  for  her  absences  on  May  2,  2016,  and  May  20,  2016,  there 
was  no  probative  evidence  that  would  establish  that  Respondent  failed  to  submit  valid 
verifications  for  her  partial  absences  of  May  25,  2016,  and  June  6,  2016.  Respondent’s 
failure  to  submit  acceptable  verifications  after  being  issued  the  April  2016  Memorandum 
constituted  a  violation  of  administrative  directives  that  Respondent  properly  verify  her 
absences  in  order  to  be  paid. 

44, 

No  probative  evidence  was  submitted  which  would  prove  that  Respondent 

failed  to  submit  acceptable  verification  and  a  certification  form  on  the  days  she  arrived  late 
to  work  during  the  period  between  August  17,  2015,  and  Jume  13,  2016,  or  that  such 
documentation  was  required  for  her  late  arrivals  during  this  time  period.  The  CBA  and  the 
EWA  do  not  require  certifications  for  tardies  and  the  memoranda  issued  to  Respondent 
during  the  2015/2016  did  not  have  any  administrative  directives  requiring  her  to  submit 
documentation.

CHAPERONE  HOURS 

AS. 

Teachers  in  the  2015/2016  school  year  would  be  required  to  report  their  own 

chaperone  hours  on  a  Google  sheet.  Lead  teacher  Samantha  Siegeler  was  responsible  for 
monitoring  the  hours. 

46. 

Ata  date  not  established  by  the  record,  Ms.  Siegeler  scheduled  a  meeting  with 

Respondent  for  February  26,  2016,  to  discuss  the  chaperone  requirement.  The  morning  of 
the  meeting,  Respondent  emailed  administration  to  advise  them  that  she  would  be  taking  a 
personal  necessity  day  as  she  needed  to  go  to  court  that  morning.  (Exhibit  562,  JSC  201.) 
Respondent,  however,  did  not  notify  Ms.  Siegeler  that  she  would  not  be  present  for  the 
meeting.  Upon  her  return,  Respondent  did  not  make  any  attempt  to  reschedule  the  meeting 
until  after  Ms.  Seigeler  emailed  her  on  February  29,  2016.  (Exhibit  562,  JSC  204.) 

47. 

AP  Aguilar  emailed  Respondent  on  March  9,  2016,  regarding  her  chaperone 

hours,  reminding  her  that  though  she  was  aware  that  she  had  completed  chaperone  hours 
with  her  various  activities,  it  was  important  that  they  be  documented.  Respondent  responded 
the  same  day,  assuring  AP  Aguilar  that  she  would  update  her  form  that  weekend  but  did  not 
do  so.  (Exhibit  562,  JSC  203.) 

48. 

AP  Aguilar  again  addressed  the  30  hour  chaperone  requirement  with 

Respondent  in  her  April  1,  2016,  memorandum,  noting  that  Respondent  had  not  documented 
her  chaperone  hours,  demonstrating  no  progress  towards  meeting  the  30  hour  chaperone 
requirement.  AP  Aguilar  also  noted  that  Respondent  had  failed  to  notify  Ms.  Siegeler  that 
she  would  not  be  attending  a  September  26,  2016  meeting  and  incorrectly  stated  that 
Respondent  had  not  responded  to  Ms.  Siegeler’s  February  29,  2016  email.  Respondent  was 
directed  to  provide  AP  Aguilar  with  her  plan  to  complete  the  30-hour  requirement  by  April  8, 
2016. 

49. 

—_  Inher  April  2016  Response,  Respondent  agreed  she  had  not  documented  her 
chaperone  hours  but  noted  that  AP  Aguilar  was  aware  and  had  acknowledged  Respondent’s 
work  with  Girls  Build  LA.  Respondent  also  incorrectly  stated  that  she  had  been  absent  the 
day  of  her  scheduled  meeting  due  to  illness’  and  provided  evidence  that  she  had  responded 
promptly  to  Ms.  Siegeler’s  February  29,  2016,  email.  Respondent  notified  AP  Aguilar  that 
she  had  updated  the  Google  sheet  and  agreed  to  follow  AP  Aguilar’s  directive  and  provide 
her  with  a  plan  to  complete  the  30-hour  requirement  by  April  8,  2016.  (Exhibit  562,  JSC  203, 
JSC  216.) 

  

*  Pursuant  to  Article  XII,  Section  14.1,  subdivision  (d),  an  employee  utilizing  a 
personal  necessity  day  is  required  to  verify  the  necessity  and  file  the  statement  with  the 
appropriate  administrator  at  least  five  working  days  in  advance  of  the  court  appearance. 

>  Respondent  submitted  evidence  of  an  email  she  had  sent  to  administration  on 

February  26,  2016,  that  she  would  taking  a  PN  as  she  needed  to  go  to  court.  (Exhibit  562,

50. 

Concerns  regarding  Respondent’s  chaperone  hours  were  agam  raised  im  the 

May  2016  memorandum.  AP  Aguilar  noted  that  though  Respondent  had  updated  the  Google 
sheet  to  show  she  bad  completed  12  hours  and  projected  completing  an  additional  seven 
hours,  Respondent  had  not  complied  with  the  directive  to  provide  her  with  a  plan  on  how  she 
intended  on  completing  the  remaming  chaperone  hour  requirement.  Respondent  was  again 
directed  to  provide  AP  Aguilar  with  a  list  of  chaperone  hours  and  her  plan  to  complete  the 
30-hour  requirement. 

Si. 

Inher  May  2016  response,  Respondent  did  not  provide  the  requested  plan  or 
explain  her  failure  to  follow  the  earlier  directive.  Respondent  simply  stated  instead,  “I  have 
documented  chaperone  hours  on  the  google  form  and  will  continue  to  do  so  m  anticipation  of 
completing  30  hours.”  (exhibit  564,  p.  ISC  235.) 

52. 

 Primeral  Navarro  again  raised  concerns  regarding  Respondent’s  chaperone 

hours  in  his  June  3,  2016,  memorandum,  noting  she  had  failed  to  follow  a  previous  directive 
in  which“...  you  were  directed  to  provide  Marike  Aguilar,  Assistant  Principal  with  a  list  of 
chaperone  hours  you  have  completed  so  far  and  your  plan  to  complete  the  30-hour 
requirement....  As  of  May  27,  2017,  you  have  only  posted  12  hour  completed  on  the 
Google  doc.  You  failed  to  submit  a  plan  to  complete  30  chaperone  hours  to  Ms.  Aguilar.” 
(Exhibit  7B,  LAUSD  101.)  Principal  Navarro  directed  Respondent  to  provide  him  with  a  list 
of  the  chaperone  hours  that  she  had  completed  so  far  and  her  plan  to  complete  the  30-hour 
requirement  by  June  6,  2016. 

53. 

In  Respondent’s  June  2016  Response,  Respondent  stated,  “You  wrote  that  I 
failed  to  follow  a  previous  directive  provided  to  me...  in  which  [  was  directed  to  provide 
your  chosen  AP  with  a  list  of  chaperone  hours  I  planned  to  complete  which  is  a  30  hour 
EWA  requirement....  I  saw  no  reason  to  provide  a  list  ...  Ifthe  AP  was  interested  in  the 
information,  she  could  have  opened  the  document  and  read  the  list...”  (Exhibit  569,  TSC 
276-277.)  In  response  to  the  directive,  Respondent  stated  “I  have  completed  the  30  required 
chaperone  hours  and  stated  that  I  had  no  knowledge  who  on  staff  would  pro-rate  mecting 
hours.  To  date  I  have  projected  34  hours  on  the  online  google  form  with  those  hours  having 
been  listed  prior  to  this  meeting  date.”  (Exhibit  569,  TSC  282.) 

54. 

Respondent  ultimately  did  not  complete  her  required  chaperone  requirement 

for  the  2015/2016  school  year. 

55. 

Principal  Navarro  conducted  a  conference  during  the  new  school  year  on 

August  31,  2016,  to  address  Respondent's  unchanged  conduct  during  the  2016/2017  school 
year  and  to  document  the  administration’s  concerns  with  Respondent's  conduct  during  the 
2015/2016  school  year. 
A  memorandum  was  issued  summarizing  the  issues  addressed  and 
the  directives  issucd  during  the  meeting  (August  2016  Memorandum). 

56. 

Ht  was  noted  in  the  August  2016  Memorandum  that  Respondent  failed  to 
complete  the  chaperone  requirement,  stating  that  she  was  misleadimg  when  she  did  the 
folowmg:  (1)  Respondent  clanmed  five  chaperone  hours  fora  GBLA  event  on  September  29,

2016,  that  she  did  not  attend.  Christi Ann  Marron  had  attended  this  event.  Additionally,  the 
event  had  been  held  during  school  hours  and  was  not  an  eligible  event  for  chaperone  hours. 
(2)  Respondent  claimed  six  chaperone  hours  for  a  GBLA  event  on  October  27,  2016.  The 
event  took  place  on  a  school  day  and  was  not  cligible  to  count  towards  chaperone  hours.  (3) 
Respondent  claimed  seven  chaperone  hours  fora  GBLA  event  on  May  14,  2016.  As 
Respondent  had  not  timely  submitted  paperwork  for  the  event,  it  did  not  receive  Principal 
Navarro’s  approval  and  the  event  had  been  cancelled.

At  the  hearing,  Respondent  admitted  that  she  read  the  EWA  provision 

regarding  chaperone  activities  but  testified  that  she  “overlooked”  the  provision  which  states 
that  chaperone  activities  need  to  take  place  during  non-paid  time.  Respondent,  however, 
failed  to  take  responsibility  for  her  failure  to  complete  her  chaperone  hours.  Instead, 
Respondent  blamed  AP  Aguilar  for  her  misunderstanding  of  chaperone  hours,  claiming  that 
AP  Aguilar’s  March  email  caused  her  to  believe  that  field  trips  would  be  counted  towards 
her  chaperone  hour  requirements,  which  eventually  resulted  in  her  not  completing  her 
chaperone  hours  i  the  2015/2016  school  year. 

59, 

In  addition,  Respondent  explained  that  she  included  the  September  29,  2016 

field  trip  on  the  Google  sheet  which  had  been  attended  by  Ms.  Marron  because  she  had 
organized  the  field  trip  from  start  to  finish.  According  to  Respondent,  she  ended  up  not 
gomp  onthe  field  trip  because  AP  Aguilar  requested  her  to  stay  for  an  emergency  IEP  and 
she  documented  it  properly  in  the  Google  sheet.  Respondent  provided  no  explanation  as  to 
why  she  inchided  the  cancelled  May  14,  2016  event. 

60. 

In  the  present  instance,  the  EWA  explicitly  states,  “[tleachers  will  chaperone 

activities  beyond  the  school  day  (non-paid).”  Contrary  to  Respondent's  contention,  AP 

i3

Aguilar  attempted  to  bring  Respondent  into  compliance  long  before  the  end  of  the  school 
year.  Though  Respondent  initially  agreed  to  provide  AP  Aguilar  with  a  plan  regarding  her 
chaperone  hours,  she  eventually  refused  to  comply  with  the  directive  because  she  “saw  no 
reason  to  provide  the  list.”  (Exhibit  569,  JSC  276-277.) 

61. 

Based  on  Findings  45  through  60,  Respondent  failed  to  complete  30-hours  of 

chaperone  activities  as  required  by  the  EWA.  Additionally,  Respondent  attempted  to  take 
credit  for  unauthorized  chaperone  hours  by  documenting  hours  which  took  place  during 
school  hours,  hours  for  an  event  she  did  not  attend,  and  hours  for  an  event  which  had  been 
canceled.  Respondent’s  conduct  constituted  a  willful  refusal  to  follow  administrative 
directives  and  perform  her  work  obligations. 

OTHER  ALLEGATIONS  OF  MISCONDUCT 

62. 

The  District  did  not  establish  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  the 
interaction  between  Physical  Education  Ms.  Saravia  and  AP  Aguilar  on  May  24,  2016, 
constitutes  grounds  for  discipline.  In  the  June  2016  Memorandum,  the  incident  involving 
Ms.  Saravia  and  AP  Aguilar  was  discussed  and  described  as  occurring  at  approximately  8:30 
a.m.  that  morning.  According  to  Respondent,  Respondent  did  not  have  a  conversation  with 
Ms.  Saravia  on  that  day  as  she  had  arrived  late  that  day  and  reported  directly  to  her 
classroom.  Respondent  further  noted  that  she  had  had  a  similar  conversation  with  Ms. 
Saravia  earlier  in  the  school  year  but  that  1t  was  in  response  to  the  complimentary  statements 
made  to  her  by  Ms.  Saravia.  As  Ms.  Saravia  did  not  testify  regarding  the  meeting,  there  was 
insufficient  evidence  to  establish  that  Respondent’s  conduct  warranted  discipline. 

63. 

The  District  did  not  establish  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that 

Respondent’s  conduct  in  altering  the  schedule  of  Steven  Acevedo,  Special  Education 
assistant,  constitutes  grounds  for  discipline.  Though  Respondent  admitted  to  making  the 
change,  Respondent  testified  that  she  made  the  change  in  order  to  accommodate  an  at-risk 
student  and  to  encourage  the  student  to  remain  in  school.  The  District  failed  to  present  any 
evidence  which  would  explain  why  making  such  a  change  was  inappropriate. 

64. 

The  District  did  not  establish  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that 

Respondent  failed  to  communicate  the  change  to  RSP  ChristiAnn  Marron,  the  classroom 
teacher  and  SAA  Jimenez.  Neither  SAA  Jimenez  nor  the  classroom  teacher  testified 
regarding  the  change.  Further,  Respondent  testified  that  RSP  Marron  had  been  aware  of  the 
change  and  that  the  change  was  reflected  in  Welligent,  the  District-wide  web-based  software 
system  used  for  online  IEPs  and  tracking  of  related  services,  the  day  of  the  reassignment.  As 
the  District  failed  to  submit  the  Welligent  documents  which  could  contradict  Respondent’s 
testimony,  the  District  failed  to  establish  Respondent  failed  to  communicate  the  changes  to 
all  parties. 

65. 

The  District  did  not  establish  by  that  during  the  period  commencing  on  April 

19,  2016,  and  ending  on  April  20,  2016,  Respondent  scheduled  IEP  meetings  for  student 
R.C.,  student  G.G.  and  G.  C.  but  failed  to  inform  an  administrator,  parents  and  IEP  team 

14

members  within  10  days  of  the  meeting.  The  District  did  not  present  any  probative  evidence 
regarding  either  G.G.  or  G.C.  Testimony  regarding  R.C.  was  confused  and  was  not  sufficient 
to  establish  by  a  preponderance  of  evidence  that  Respondent  did  not  timely  notify  IEP  team 
members  if  the  IEP  meeting. 

66. 

he  District  did  not  establish  by  a  preponderance  of  that  the  interaction 

between  Respondent  and  general  education  teacher  Kaitlm  Smith  on  April  15,  2016, 
constitutes  grounds  for  discipline.  According  to  Ms.  Smith,  she  had  been  working  with 
student  J_A.  on  an  assessment  for  her  class  and  had  taken  the  assessment  to  work  on  with  the 
student  later  during  her  office  hours.  Respondent  approached  Ms.  Smith  and  asked  her  to 
return  the  assessment  in  a  manner  which  left  her  shaken.  Respondent  testified  that  she  had 
also  been  working  on  the  assessment  with  the  student  and  had  simply  asked  Ms.  Smith  for 
the  assessment  so  they  could  continue  working  on  it.  Testimony  from  both  Ms.  Smuth  and 
Respondent  were  equally  credible  and  therefore,  it  was  not  established  by  a  preponderance  of 
the  evidence  that  Respondent’s  interaction  with  Ms.  Smith  was  inappropriate. 

67. 

The  District  did  not  establish  that  on  or  about  April  15,  2016,  Respondent 

failed  to  follow  the  regular  service  schedule  for  RT,  an  Lith  grade  student,  by  pulling  her 
from  her  general  education  classroom  and  that  Respondent  failed  to  imform  RT’s  teacher,  Mr. 
Jacobs,  of  the  purpose  of  her  pulling  the  student  from  his  classroom.  No  probative  evidence 
was  presented  regarding  this  allegation. 

68. 

Though  the  District  established  that  Respondent  sent  an  email  to  the  English 
teacher  Samantha  Siegeler  and  History  teacher  Sasha  Guzman  stating  that  student  E.F.  was 
recovering  from  the  flu,  the  District  did  not  establish  that  her  actions  in  sending  the  email 
warranted  discipline.  In  her  May  2016  Response,  Respondent  advised  administration  that 
she  had  sent  the  email  in  response  to  teacher  complaints  the  student  had  been  sleeping  in 
class  and  that  believed  E.F.  had  been  operating  under  “great  strain”  and  should  be  given  a 
chance  to  rest.  (Exhibit  564,  JSC  230-231.)  At  hearing,  Respondent  further  clarified  that  the 
student  had  come  to  her  and  told  her  that  he  had  not  been  able  to  sleep  properly  at  night 
because  his  family  became  homeless,  and  that  she  provided  him  with  a  space  to  rest.  The 
District  failed  to  establish  that  Respondent’s  conduct  in  sending  the  email  was  mmappropriate 
and  grounds  for  discipline. 

69, 

lt  was  established  that  between  January  13,  2016,  and  February  19,  2016, 
Respondent  failed  to  complete  the  required  Northwest  Evaluation  Association  (NWEA) 
online  training.  Respondent  had  been  notified  to  register  for  an  NWEA  account  in  order  to 
begin  training  on  January  15,  2016,  after  which  time,  she  would  have  27  school  days  to 
complete  the  trang.  Respondent  admutted  that  she  failed  to  compiecte  this  traiming  im  both 
her  April  2016  Response  (Exhibit  7D,  LAUSD  146  and  Exhibit  562,  JSC  204)  and  her 
response  to  the  Below  Standard  Evaluation  dated  May  4,  2016.  Neither  response,  however, 
provided  any  explanation  for  her  failure  to  complete  the  onlme  training.  Respondent's 
failure  to  complete  the  NWEA  trainmg  constituted  a  willful  failure  to  perform  her  work 
obligations. 

15

70. 

The  District  did  not  establish  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that 

Respondent  failed  to  attend  the  required  9th  and  12th  grade  level  meetings  during  the  period 
between  February  1,  2016,  and  February  22,  2016.  Teachers  at  Humanitas  were  required  by 
the  EWA  to  attend  one  grade  level  meeting  a  week.  As  Respondent  was  not  assigned  to  a 
grade  level,  she  was  given  the  option  of  attending  every  week  of  attending  either  the  9th 
grade  level  meeting  or  the  12th  grade  level  meeting.  There  was  no  evidence  that  Respondent 
would  be  required  to  attend  both  the  9th  and  the  12th  grade  level  meetings  in  February  2016. 
Further,  though  Respondent  missed  the  grade  level  meetings  on  February  1,  2016,,  February 
8,  2016,,  and  February  22,  2016,,  there  was  no  evidence  presented  that  Respondent  missed  a 
grade  level  meeting  during  the  week  of  February  15,  2016. 

71. 

The  District  established  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  Respondent’s 

conduct  on  March  14,  2016,  at  a  9th  grade  level  team  meeting  constituted  grounds  for 
discipline.  Respondent’s  behavior  during  the  meeting  was  witnessed  by  AP  Aguilar  who 
documented  her  observations  in  the  April  2016  Memorandum.  According  to  AP  Aguilar,  she 
witnessed  Respondent  arrive  at  approximately  4:15  p.m.  for  the  9th  grade  level  team  meeting 
that  began  at  3:50  p.m.  When  Respondent  arrived,  she  sat  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  room, 
did  not  participate  in  the  team  discussion  and  left  before  the  meeting  had  concluded. 

72. 

According  to  Respondent,  her  reason  for  arriving  late  to  the  meeting  was  that  a 

student  had  rushed  in  needing  to  print  SAT  scores  to  submit  to  colleges.  Respondent 
permitted  to  the  student  to  print  her  scores  and  then  went  to  the  meeting  when  she  was 
finished.  Respondent  testified  that  when  she  arrived  at  the  meeting,  she  sat  opposite  the 
teachers  because  she  had  the  flu,  and  she  did  not  want  to  infect  anyone.  Respondent 
admitted  that  she  did  not  participate  in  the  discussion  because  of  her  condition,  “I  was  there 
but  I  was  obviously  checked  out.”  Additionally,  during  this  time,  Respondent  felt  that  the 
9th  grade  level  team  was  not  receptive  to  her  ideas  and  that  she  was  being  silenced.  The  9th 
grade  level  team  would  not  implement  changes  that  did  not  come  from  administration. 
Respondent  subsequently  left  the  9th  grade  level  meeting  at  4:45  p.m.  which  she  contends 
was  the  time  she  was  told  by  Lead  Teacher  Lourdes  Lizzaraga  that  the  meeting  ended. 

73. 

Though  Respondent  testified  that  she  had  been  recently  ill,  Respondent  had 

not  taken  any  absences  for  her  own  illness  for  the  entire  month  preceding  this  meeting.° 
Additionally,  AP  Aguilar’s  observation  of  Respondent’s  conduct  at  the  meeting  was  similar 
to  what  was  described  by  a  number  of  other  teachers,  including  Assistant  Principal  Jeff 
Austin,  Ms.  Smith  and  Ms.  Sasha  Guzman,  in  their  testimony  regarding  their  observations  of 
her  behavior.  Respondent’s  conduct  at  the  meeting  constituted  a  willful  refusal  to  perform 
work  obligations  without  reasonable  cause. 

  

°  Additionally,  though  she  had  been  tardy  the  day  of  the  meeting,  her  reason  for  the 
tardiness  was  due  to  a  combination  of  traffic  and  the  LAUSD  bus  being  nine  minutes  late. 
The  following  day,  Respondent  took  absence,  however,  her  stated  reason  for  the  absence  was 
due  to  the  illness  of  her  daughter. 

16

74. 

‘Phe  District  has  aleged  that  Respondent’s  failure  to  bold  an  IEP  meeting  for 

R.C.,  a  student  in  her  caseload,  on  March  10,  2016  constitutes  a  ground  for  discipline. 
According  to  the  evidence  presented,  Respondent  received  an  email  from  AP  Aguilar  on 
March  10,  2016,  wherem  AP  Aguilar  advised  her  that  the  parent  had  consented  to  hold  the 
LEP  in  his  absence.  Though  the  April  2016  Memorandum  suggests  that  the  TEP  had  not  been 
held  for  at  least  seven  days  following  this  communication,  Respondent  testified  that  the  team 
was  assembled  for  the  LEP  meeting  five  days  after  the  email.  There  was  no  evidence  that 
would  suggest  that  this  was  an  undue  delay.  Based  on  the  forgoing,  the  District  has  tailed  to 
establish  that  Respondent’s  failure  to  hold  the  LEP  meeting  for  the  student  on  March  10, 
2016,  constitutes  grounds  for  discipline. 

SJHA  Annual  Retreat  Training 

78. 

The  Humanitas  EWA’s  provision  regardmg  Working  Hours  states,  “All 

teachers  shall  attend  our  SJHA  annual  retreat.”  (@xhibit  4.) 

76. 

According  to  Respondent,  she  did  not  attend  the  retreat  as  her  uncle  passed 

away  suddenly  on  May  29,  2016,  and  was  buried  on  June  11,  2016.  Respondent  opted 
imstead  to  stay  with  her  family. 

77. 

Principal  Navarro  testified  that  he  first  received  notification  that  Respondent 

would  not  be  attending  on  the  second  day  of  the  retreat. 

78. 

Respondent  admitted  at  hearing  that  though  the  Certificate  of  Absence  was 
purportedly  signed  on  June  10,  2016,  but  that  the  date  was  in  error  and  she  submitted  the 
document  sometime  after  she  took  leave.  Respondent  had  used  a  preprinted  Certificate  of 
Absence  and  neglected  to  change  to  date  on  the  Certificate. 

79. 

Respondent  felt  that  tt  was  not  necessary  to  submut  a  Certification  of  Absence 

as  the  school  was  not  in  session.  According  to  Respondent,  she  felt  that  her  absence  was  a 
“moot  pomt”  because  the  District  was  not  in  session.  In  her  mind,  annual  retreat  was  a 
“three  day  vacation.” 

80. 

Under  Article  XU,  section  9.0,  “Lain  employee  is  entitled  to  paid  leave/absence 

from  the  District  not  to  exceed  three  days,  on  account  of  the  death  of a  member  of  the 
employee's  immediate  family  if  acceptable  proof  of  the  death  and  relationship  is  provided 
and  leave/absence  commences  within  ten  calendar  days  of  the  death.”  The  immediate  family 
is  defined  as  “the  employee's:  (a)  Spouse  or  ...  cohabitant  who  ts  the  equivalent  of  4  spouse 
(b)  Parent...  (c})  Grandparent  ...  (d)  Child  ...  (¢)  Grandchild  ... 
Any  relatrve  living  in  the  employee’s  immediate  household.” 

(2)  Brother  (2)  Sister  (G) 

8l. 

Article  XT,  Section  14.0,  subsection  (a),  however,  permits  an  emplovee  to  use 

the 
personal  necessity  leaves  due  to  the  “[djeath  of  a  close  friend  or  relative  not  included  im 
definition  of  immediate  family.”  Section  14.1,  however,  requires  the  employee  to  verify  the 

i7

nature  of  the  necessity  and  generally  limits  the  mumber  of  personal  necessity  absences  in  one 
school  year  to  six  days. 

&2. 

Article  XE,  Section  17.0,  lmits  the  occasions  which  a  permanent  employee 

may  take  unpaid  personal  leave  for  a  specific  personal  reason  satisfactory  to  the  District. 

83. 

Inthe  present  mstance,  though  Respondent  considers  Humanitas’s  annual 
retreat  to  be  a  “three  day  vacation,”  it  is,  i  fact,  a  fimction  required  by  the  EWA,  which 
Respondent  signed  and  agreed  to  in  accepting  the  position  at  Humanitas. 

84. 

Additionally,  Respondent  was  not  entitled  to  claim  bereavement  leave  due  to 
the  death  of  her  uncle.  Respondent’s  uncle  was  not  an  immediate  family  member  as  defined 
under  Article  XTL,  section  9.0.  Article  XU  further  requires  that  bereavement  be  taken  within 
ten  calendar  days  of  the  death.  In  this  case,  Respondent  attermpted  to  take  bereavernent  leave 
from  June  13,2016,  until  June  £6,  2016.  As  her  uncle  passed  on  May  29,  2016,  her  leave 
commenced  more  than  ten  calendar  days  of  the  death  and  was  therefore  outside  the  time 
permitted  for  bereavement  leave. 

85. 

There  was  no  similar  conditions  attached  to  the  use  of  personal  necessity  leave 

(either  paid  or  unpaid)  for  the  death  of a  family  member. 

86. 

Respondent,  however,  provided  no  explanation  for  why  she  failed  to  either 

request  or  notify  Humanitas  administration  that  she  would  be  taking  such  leave  until  the 
second  day  of  the  retreat. 

87. 

Based  on  Findings  75  through  &6,  Respondent's  conduct  in  failing  to  attend 

the  required  SJHA  Summer  Retreat  traiming  was  in  violation  of  the  District’s  rules  and 
constituted  a  willful  refusal  to  perform  a  regular  assignment  without  reasonable  cause. 

Notice  of  Unsatisfactory  Act 

88. 

On  October  5,  2016,  a  Notice  of  Unsatisfactory  Act  was  approved  by  the 

District.  A  conference  regarding  the  notice  was  held  with  Respondent  on  October  18,  2016. 

89. 

The  Notice  recommended  that  Respondent  be  suspended  for  eight  days. 

2016/2017  School  Year 

90. 

Principal  Navarro  conducted  a  second  conference  during  the  new  school  year 
on  October  4,  2016  to  address  the  administration’s  concerns  regarding  Respondent  conduct 
im  the  2016/2017  school  year.  Present  at  the  conference  was  both  Principal  Dana  Neui  and 
UTLA  representative  Kim  McLaughtin. 

91. 

Included  among  the  items  discussed  was  the  concern  regarding  Respondent’s 
attendance.  Since  the  start  of  the  2016/2017  school  year,  1t  was  noted  that  Respondent  had 

is

been  absent  five  days,  partially  absent  nine  times,  and  tardy  on  12  occasions.  Respondent 
had  not  completed  and  submitted  anv  FMLA  forms  to  Humanitas  administration  during  this 
period. 

92. 

Also  addressed  was  Respondent’s  failure  to  attend  the  Back  to  School  Night 

on  September  1,  2016,  and  her  faulure  to  attend  the  Awards  Night  on  September  8,  2016. 

93. 

Respondent  was  provided  with  a  memorandum  that  day  (October  2016 
Memorandum)  which  provided  directives,  assistance  and  guidance  to  Respondent  m  a 
number  of  areas,  includimg  her  attendance.  During  the  conference,  Respondent  was 
“remided  ...  that  absences  duc  to  iliness  or  personal  necessity  are  not  protected  unless  they 
are  covered  by  the  Family  Medical  Leave  Act  (PMLA).  ..”  and  was  directed  to  “provide 
acceptable  verification  in  addition  to  the  Certification  of  Iliness/Non-HIness  forms  for  every 
absence  and/or  tardy...  Additionally  this  applies  to  the  times  you  arrive  late.”  Gixhibit  8&, 
LAUSD  74  and  LAUSD  75.)  Respondent  was  again  provided  with  FMLA  forms  and 
advised  to  return  the  completed  forms  to  Prmcipal  Navarro  by  October  9,  2016,  ifthey  were 
applicable. 

94. 

Respondent  subsequently  submitted  a  response  to  the  October  2016 

Memorandum  (October  2016  Response).  In  it,  Respondent  admitted  that  she  had  been 
absent  and  tardy  on  a  number  of  occasions  but  requested  that  she  be  provided  with  logs  and 
the  certification  and  verification  forms  she  provided  the  school. 

95. 

With  respect  to  her  failure  to  attend  the  Back  to  School  Night  and  Awards 
Night,  Respondent  responded  that  she  had  been  ill  and  unable  to  attend  both  the  events. 

96. 

Though  Respondent  emailed  Principal  Navarro  and  AP  Aguilar  shortly  before 

the  September  1,  2016  Back  to  School  event,  she  does  not  appear  to  have  submitted  any 
certification  or  verification  forms  submitted  for  her  absence  that  evening.  Further,  it  appears 
that  Respondent  was  able  to  return  to  work  the  following  day. 

97. 

With  respect  to  the  Awards  Night,  which  was  held  on  September  8,  2016, 

Respondent  did  not  notify  administration  that  she  would  not  be  present  that  night.  She  had 
been  at  work  that  same  morning.  Respondent  did  take  a  sick  day  the  following  day  on 
September  9,  2016,  however,  Respondent  did  not  send  an  email  to  administration  until  10:46 
am.  that  day.  (Exhibit  528.)  Respondent  had  apparently  drafted  the  emai  at  5:00  a.m.  that 
morning  but,  for  whatever  reason,  it  had  not  been  sent  to  Humanitas.  (Exhibit  529.) 
Respondent  did  not,  however,  provide  administration  with  cither  a  certification  or 
verification  of  that  absence. 

98. 

Respondent's  failure  to  attend  the  Back  to  School  Night  and  Awards  Night 

constitutes  a  willful  refusal  to  perform  regular  assignments  without  reasonable  cause. 

99, 

 Followimg  the  October  4,  2016  conference  until  the  next  conference  on 

November  15,  2016,  Respondent  was  absent  an  additional  five  days,  partially  absent  an 

ig

additional  five  times,  and  tardy  on  Li  additional  occasions.  Respondent  did  not  conrplete 
and  submit  any  FMLA  forms  to  Principal  Navarro  during  this  period. 

100. 

On  Novernber  15,  2016,  Principal  Navarro  conducted  a  conference  with 

Respondent  to  address  the  administration’s  continuing  concerns.  Among  those  concerns  was 
the  ongomg  concern  regarding  Respondent’s  attendance.  Respondent  was  provided  with  two 
memoranda  of  the  meeting.  The  first  (November  2016  Memorandum)  primarily  addressed 
the  administration’s  concerns  related  to  Respondent’s  attendance,  the  second  (November 
2016  Memorandum  of  Unprofessional  Conduct)  addressed  the  administration's  concerns 
regarding  Respondent’s  conduct  m  managing  the  LEPs  of  students  in  her  caseload  and  her 
interactions  with  other  staff.  Along  with  the  November  2016  Memorandum,  Respondent  was 
provided  with  the  FMLA  forms  and  advised  that,  if  applicable,  she  was  to  return  the 
completed  forms  to  Principal  Navarro  by  October  9,  2016,. 

LOL. 

Followimg  the  November  15,  2016  conference  until  the  January  31,2017 

conference,  Respondent  was  absent  an  additional  five  days,  partially  absent  an  additional 
four  times,  and  tardy  on  six  additional  occasions.  Respondent  did  not  complete  and  submit 
any  FMLA  forms  te  Principal  Navarro  during  this  period. 

102. 

On  January  31,  2017,  Principal  Navarre  scheduled  a  conference  with 

Respondent.  Due  to  Respondent’s  illness,  Respondent  requested  that  the  meeting  be  held  in 
her  absence.  The  items  addressed  included  the  ongoing  concern  regarding  Respondent’s 
attendance.  The  memorandum  of  the  meeting  (January  2017  Memorandum)  was  provided  to 
Respondent  with  directives,  assistance  and  guidance  to  Respondent  in  a  number  of  areas, 
including  her  attendance.  Along  with  the  memorandum,  Respondent  was  provided  with  the 
FMLA  forms  and  advised  that,  1f  applicable,  she  was  to  return  the  completed  forms  to 
Principal  Navarro  by  February  6,  2017. 

103. 

Followimg  the  January  31,  2017  conference  until  the  March  8,  2017 

conference,  Respondent  was  absent  an  additional  six  days,  partially  absent  an  additional  five 
times,  and  tardy  on  four  additional  occasions. 

104. 

On  March  8,  2017,  Principal  Navarro  scheduled  a  conference  with 

Respondent.  Due  to  Respondent’s  illness,  Respondent  requested  that  the  meeting  was  held 
ia  her  absence.  The  ttems  addressed  included  the  ongome  concern  regarding  Respondent’s 
attendance.  The  memorandum  ofthe  meeting  (March  2017  Memorandum)  was  provided  to 
the  Respondent  with  directives,  assistance  and  guidance  to  Respondent  im  a  number  of  areas, 
mcluding  ber  attendance.  The  memorandum  noted  that  Respondent  submitted  the  completed 
PMLA  forms  on  February  9,  2017. 

10S. 

Parties  stipulated  that  Respondent  was  absent  for  a  total  of  six  days  during  the 

period  between  August  15,  2016  and  ending  on  February  24,  2017  as  follows:  August  [5, 
2016;  September  9,  2016;  September  22,  2016;  January  18,  2017;  and  February  23-24,  2017. 

20

106. 

Respondent’s  certifications  and  emails  established  that  Respondent  was  absent 

an  additional  10  days  as  follows:  August  26,  2016;  September  19,  2016;’  October  10,  2016; 
January  23,  2017;  February  9,  2017;  February  17,  2017;  and  February  21-24,  2017. 
Respondent’s  Time  Cards  established  that  Respondent  was  absent  on  October  25,  2016; 
October  28,  2016;  November  2,  2016;  November  7,  2016;  December  12,  2016;  January  9, 
2017;  January  12,  2017;  January  17,  2017;  and  January  26,  2017. 

107. 

Respondent’s  time  cards  established  that  Respondent  was  also  absent  on  nine 

other  occasions  as  follows:  October  25,  2016;  October  28,  2016;  November  2,  2016; 
November  7,  2016;  December  12,  2016;  January  9,  2017;  January  12,  2017;  January  17, 
2017;  and  January  26,  2017. 

108. 

Based  on  the  forgoing,  Respondent  was  absent  25  days  in  the  2016/2017 

school  year  between  August  15,  2016,  and  March  7,  2017.  Respondent’s  continued  absences 
during  the  2016/2017  school  year  constituted  a  willful  refusal  to  perform  regular  assignments 
without  reasonable  cause. 

CERTIFICATIONS  AND  VERIFICATIONS 

109. 

Following  issuance  of  the  August  2016  Memorandum,  Respondent  was  given 
a  directive  to  “provide  acceptable  verification  in  addition  to  the  Certification  of  illness/non- 
.”  (Exhibit  7A,  LAUSD 
illness  forms  for  every  absence  and/or  tardy  in  order  to  be  paid  .. 
96.)  In  Respondent’s  response  to  the  August  2016  Memorandum  (August  2016  Response), 
Respondent  agreed  to  follow  the  directives.  (Exhibit  574,  JSC  753.) 

110. 

Ms.  McLaughlin’s  testimony  established  such  directives  were  not  onerous  or 

outside  what  could  be  expected  when  an  employee  has  been  counseled  regarding  attendance. 
As  this  directive  was  in  response  to  ongoing  concerns  regarding  Respondent’s  attendance, 
Respondent  could  appropriately  be  directed  to  submit  verifications  for  her  tardiness. 

111. 

This  directive  was  reiterated  in  the  October  2016  Memorandum,  which  listed 

the  dates  for  which  the  administration  had  not  received  verifications  and  certifications.  In 
the  October  2016  Response,  Respondent  claimed  that  she  had  “provided  verification  of  all 
illness,  and  personal  necessity  absences  when  applicable.”  (Exhibit  574,  JSC  751.)  No 
copies  of  these  verifications  were  submitted  at  hearing. 

112. 

The  October  2016  Memorandum,  November  2016  Memorandum,  January 
2017  Memorandum,  and  March  2017  Memorandum  list  the  dates  for  which  Respondent 
failed  to  submit  the  verifications  and  certifications.  These  dates  were  determined  with  the 
assistance  of  SAA  Jimenez,  utilizing  the  attendance  records  that  were  maintained  by  SAA 

  

7  Respondent  was  absent  on  September  19,  2016,  due  to  a  medical  appointment, 
missing  her  appointment  with  Principal  Navarro.  Respondent,  however,  did  not  notify 
Principal  Navarro  that  she  would  be  absent  on  that  date  until  8:28  p.m.  on  September  18, 
2016.  (Exhibit  531.) 

21

Jimenez  in  the  course  of  her  employment.  Each  of  these  memoranda  also  reiterated  the 
directive  that  Respondent  provide  verifications  and  certifications  for  all  her  tardies  and 
absences. 

113. 

Respondent  testified  that  she  became  aware  that  there  may  be  an  issue 

regarding  her  certification  forms  which  prompted  her  to  start  making  copies  of  these  forms 
before  they  were  submitted  to  Humanitas  after  June  10,  2016.  Further,  Respondent  was 
aware  that  there  was  an  issue  regarding  her  verifications  as  her  lack  of  verifications  were 
documented  in  the  August  2016  Memorandum.  The  dates  for  which  Respondent  failed  to 
submit  proper  verifications  are  listed  in  the  August  2016  Memorandum.  These  dates  were 
determined  by  Principal  Navarro,  with  the  assistance  of  SAA  Jimenez,  by  review  of  the 
documentation  submitted  by  Respondent  to  the  school  in  connection  with  her  absences. 
Despite  these  concerns,  Respondent  did  not  submit  any  of  the  verifications  for  many  tardies 
and  absences  during  the  2016/2017  school  year  at  hearing. 

114. 

Based  on  the  forgoing,  it  was  established  that,  during  the  period  between 

August  26,  2016,  and  ending  February  24,  2017,  Respondent  failed  to  submit  certifications 
forms  for  the  absences  on  September  9,  2016;  September  22,  2016;  October  10,  2016; 
October  30,  2016;  November  7,  2016;  January  9,  2017;  January  17,  2017;  and  January  26, 
2017.  Respondent’s  failure  to  submit  certifications  forms  for  these  dates  constitutes  a  willful 
refusal  to  perform  regular  assignments  without  reasonable  cause. 

115. 

There  was,  however,  no  probative  evidence  to  show  that  Respondent  failed  to 

submit  a  certification  for  her  absence  on  August  26,  2016. 

116. 

Additionally,  Respondent  established  that  she  submitted  certification  form  for 
her  absence  of  January  18,  2017,  on  January  24,  2017;  and  submitted  a  certification  form  for 
her  absences  of  February  23,  2017  and  February  24,  2017,  on  March  1,  2017.  (Exhibit  538 
and  547.) 

117. 

During  the  period  between  August  26,  2016,  and  ending  February  24,  2017,  ® 
Respondent  failed  to  provide  Humanitas  administration  with  acceptable  verifications  for  her 
absences  on  September  9,  2016;  September  22,  2016;  October  10,  2016;  October  25,  2016; 
October  30,  2016;  November  7,  2016;  November  30,  2016;  January  9,  2017;  January  12, 
2017;  January  17,  2017;  January  18,  2017;  and  January  26,  2017.  Respondent’s  failure  to 
submit  acceptable  verifications  for  these  dates  constitute  a  willful  refusal  to  perform  regular 
assignments  without  reasonable  cause. 

118. 

The  District  did  not  establish  that  Respondent  failed  to  provide  a  verification 

for  her  absence  on  August  26,  2016. 

  

Charges  were  not  considered.

1i9. 

Additionally,  though  Respondent  did  submit  verification  for  her  absence  on 

February  23,  2017  and  February  24,  2017,  the  verification  was  mconsistent  with  the 
certification  she  submitted  regarding  her  absences.  According  to  the  certification  submitted 
on  March  1,  2017,  Respondent  requested  two  days  leave  due  to  the  illness  of  her  daughter. 
However,  the  doctor’s  note  she  submitted  excusing  her  fron;  work  for  those  days,  lists 
Respondent  as  the  patient.  Absences  due  to  illnesses  are  categorized  differently  than 
personal  necessity  days  which  are  used  to  provide  care  for  family  members.  Respondent’s 
submission  of  these  documents  constituted  a  willful  failure  to  follow  the  administrative 
directive  to  complete  all  District  forms,  including  Certifications  of  absence  forms,  truthfully 
and  accurately  at  all  times. 

120. 

Durimg  the  period  between  August  26,  2016,  and  ending  February  24,  2017, 

Respondent  failed  to  provide  Humanitas  administration  with  acceptable  verifications  for  her 
partial  absences  on  August  16,  2016;  August  19,  2016:  August  25,  2016;  August  29,  2016; 
September  8,  2016;  September  23,  2016:  September  28,  2016;  October  4,  2016;  October  7, 
2016;  October  18,  2016;  November  4,  2016;  December  9,  2016;  December  14,  2016: 
December  16,  2016:  and  January  23,  2017.  Respondent's  failure  to  provide  acceptable 
verifications  for  her  partial  absences  on  these  dates  constituted  a  willful  failure  of 
Respondent  to  follow  the  administrative  directive  to  provide  acceptable  verifications  of  every 
absence. 

i121. 

The  District  did  not  establish  that  Respondent  failed  to  provide  verifications 

for  her  partial  absences  on  September  15,  2016,  and  September  29,  2016. 

122. 

During  the  period  between  August  26,  2016,  and  ending  February  24,  2017, 
Respondent  failed  to  provide  Humanitas  verification  for  her  tardies  on  the  following  dates: 
August  19,  2016;  August  31,  2016;  September  1,  2016,  September  7,  2016;  September  12- 
14,  2016;  September  16,  2016;  September  20,  2016;  September  21,  2016:  September  26,

November  17,  2016;  December  5,  2016;  December  7,  2016;  December  9,  2016;  January  19, 
2017;  fanuary  20,  2017;  January  25,  2017;  January  30,  2017,  February  1,  2017;  February  3,

2017  and  March  2,  2017.  Respondent’s  failure  to  provide  acceptable  verifications  for  her 
tardies  on  these  dates  constituted  a  willful  failure  of  Respondent  to  follow  the  administrative 
directive  to  provide  acceptable  verifications  of  every  absence. 

OTHER  ALLEGATIONS  OF  MISCONDUCE 

123. 

It  was  not  established  that  Respondent’s  conduct  on  September  12,  2016,  mm 

refusing  to  remove  an  accommodation  of  Total  Physical  Response  (TPR)  for  a  student  durimg 
bis  IEP  was  grounds  for  discipline.  The  student,  5.P.,  had  come  to  LAUSD  from  a  different 
school  district  with  an  TEP  which  mcluded  TPR  as  a  strategy.  LAUSD  policy  for  handling 
out  of  district  TEPs  is  to  simply  transfer  the  miormation  and  to  implement  it.  A  new  LEP  is 

23

not  to  be  designed  or  developed  unt  additional  information  is  obtained  about  the  student.  In 
the  present  instance,  the  District  did  not  present  any  evidence  that  TPR  was  an  mappropriate 
accommodation  which  would  deviate  from  District  policy. 

124. 

ft  was  not  established  that  on  September  26,  2016,  when  the  TEP  for  student 

S.P,  was  reconvened,  Respondent  was  disrespectful  to  Jeff  Austm,  a  member  of  the  IEP 
team.  At  hearing,  Mr.  Austin  was  not  able  to  recall  the  specific  details  of  the  meident. 
Additionally,  no  other  LEP  team  members  testified  to  observing  this  conduct. 

125. 

it  was  established  that  on  September  13,  2016  IEP  meeting  for  student  N.L., 

LEP  team  agreed  to  take  a  10  minute  recess  as  AP  Aguilar  had  to  confirm  some  information. 
Despite  the  fact  that  all  team  members  agreed  to  the  recess,  Respondent  either  reconvened  or 
attempted  to  reconvene  the  meeting  m  AP  Aguilar’s  absence. 

126. 

The  District  did  not  establish  that  Respondent  conducted  herself 
inappropriately  during  the  September  16,  2016,  Special  Education  department  meeting  where 
the  IEP  master  schedule  was  being  discussed.  There  was  no  probative  evidence  regarding 
this  allegation. 

127. 

The  evidence  did  not  establish  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  on 

September  16,  2016,  Respondent  acted  inappropriately  towards  SAA  Jimenez. 

128. 

The  evidence  did  not  establish  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  during 
the  August  31,  2016  conference  with  Principal  Navarro  and  SAA  Jimenez,  Respondent  acted 
inappropriately  towards  SAA  Jimenez. 

129. 

The  District  did  not  establish  that  Respondent  conducted  herself 

inappropriately  during  the  September  20,  2016,  1ith  grade  team  level  meeting.  There  was 
no  probative  evidence  presented  regarding  this  allegation. 

130. 

On  September  30,  2016,  during  a  meeting  with  Lead  Teacher  Siegeler  and 

Instructional  coach  Paul  Payne  to  discuss  co-teaching  models,  Respondent  failed  to 
participate  im  the  meeting,  pushing  back  documents  Mr.  Payne  provided  and  stating  that  she 
knew  the  models.  According  to  Respondent,  she  did  not  participate  in  the  meeting  because 
she  did  not  feel  that  Ms.  Siegeler’s  class  was  a  class  that  was  appropriate  for  co-teaching. 

i3i. 

The  District  did  not  establish  that  Respondent  acted  inappropriately  on 

September  30,  2016,  when  communicating  with  AP  Aguilar  about  rescheduling  an  IEP 
mecting  so  an  administrative  designee  would  be  available.  There  was  no  probative  evidence 
presented  regarding  this  allegation. 

132. 

The  District  established  that  durmg  the  period  commencing  on  October  10, 

2016,  and  ending  on  October  17,  2016,  Respondent  failed  to  submit  a  draft  IEP  prior  to 
M.C.’s  scheduled  meetmg.  Ms.  Siegeler  testified  that  due  to  the  lack  ofa  draft  IEP,  LEP 
mecting  took  considerably  longer  and  had  to  be  reconvened  multiple  times. 

24

133. 

The  District  did  not  establish  that  Respondent  failed  to  have  drafted  an  IEP 

with  math  goals  as  there  was  no  probative  evidence  regarding  the  lack  of  math  goals. 
Teacher  Siegeler  is  an  English  teacher  and  did  not  testify  that  the  delays  and  multiple 
meetings  were  due  to  a  lack  of  math  goals. 

134. 

The  District  has  alleged  that  on  October  14,  2016,  Respondent  failed  to 

provide  an  academic  assessment  result  to  school  psychologist  Maria  Yocum  so  that  she  could 
complete  a  comprehensive  assessment  in  time  for  an  PEP  for  student  H.F.  At  hearing,  Ms. 
Yocum  could  not  recall  if  there  had  been  a  delay  in  receiving  an  assessment  from 
Respondent  or  if  Respondent  had  even  attended  H.P.’s  IEP  meeting.  Ms.  Yocum  appeared  to 
be  disinclined  to  provide  any  mformation  regarding  her  interactions  with  Respondent.  What 
little  information  that  was  provided  was  extremely  cursory  and  lacked  any  substance.  As 
such,  no  probative  evidence  was  submitted  regarding  this  allegation. 

135. 

The  District  failed  to  prove  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  on 

October  17,  2016,  Respondent  failed  to  arrange  for  substitute  coverage  and  arrange  language 
translation  for  H.F.’s  LEP  meeting 

136. 

On  October  [1,  2016,  Respondent  failed  to  arrange  substitute  coverage  for 

teachers  attending  the  meeting.  Respondent  did  not  send  notifications  to  J.R.’s  teachers,  AP 
Aguilar  and  Principal  Navarro  of  the  need  for  coverage  until  the  day  before  the  IEP,  which 
resulted  in  one  teacher  of  J.R.’s  teachers  being  unable  to  attend.  Respondent  failed  to 
include  SAA  Jimenez  in  the  email  which  resulted  in  SAA  Jimenez  have  to  find  appropriate 
substitutes  the  day  of  the  TEP. 

137. 

Following  the  notification,  Ms.  Siegeler  emailed  Respondent  several  times  to 

propose  they  meet  or  to  provide  feedback.  Respondent  did  not  respond  and  provide  Ms. 
Siegeler  a  draft  LEP  until  7:25  p.m. 

138. 

Respondent  testified  that  Ms.  Sicgeler  recommended  one-on-one  support 

services  for  student  J.R.  One-on-one  support  services  are  also  referred  to  as  Behavior 
Intervention  Implementation  (BID  service.  Ms.  Siegeler,  however,  denied  that  she  had 
recommended  one-on-one  support  for  the  student.  She  credibly  testified  that  the  first  time 
she  heard  about  such  a  support  for  J.R.  was  during  the  meeting.  As  the  other  members  of  the 
IEP  team  disagreed  with  Respondent’s  recommendation  for  a  one-on-one,  the  meeting 
became  extremely  contentious,  resulting  in  an  LEP  that  took  3.5  hours.  Ms.  Siegeler’s 
testimony  at  hearing  is  consistent  with  what  was  documented  in  the  summary  of  the 
conference  of  unprofessional  conduct  held  with  Respondent  on  November  15,  2016. 

Notice  of  Unsatisfactory  Act 

139. 

On  March  13,  2017,  a  Notice  of  Unsatisfactory  Act  was  approved  by  the 
District.  A  conference  regarding  the  notice  was  held  with  Respondent  on  May  5,  2017. 

140. 

The  Notice  recommended  that  Respondent  be  dismissed  from  LAUSD. 

25

impact  of  Respondent’s  Attendance  on  Students 

141. 

The  evidence  established  that  Respondent  generally  keeps  abreast  of  and 

implements  research-based  techniques  proven  to  benefit  children  with  special  needs. 

142. 

However,  the  evidence  also  established  that  Respondent’s  poor  attendance 

record  hampered  her  ability  to  apply  those  techniques  for  the  benefits  of  her  students. 

143. 

As  stated  in  the  Humanitas  EWA,  the  workday  for  Humanitas  teachers  begins 
one  half  hour  before  the  mstructional  day.  This  half  hour  is  generally  intended  to  be  used  as 
a  conference  period.  By  failing  to  arrive  at  the  start  of  the  workday,  Respondent  was  not 
available  for  students  to  meet  with  her  prior  to  the  imstructional  day. 

144. 

Robert  Tostado  is  a  teacher  at  Humanitas.  Mr.  Tostada  testified  very  credibly 

regarding  his  experience  with  Respondent  during  the  2016/2017  School  Year.  That  year, 
Respondent  was  assigned  an  11th  grade  advisory  class.  Mr.  Tostado’s  role  was  to  provide 
support  for  the  class.  His  original  role,  however,  ended  up  expanding  and  he  ended  up  acting 
as  a  substitute  on  the  occasions  Respondent  was  not  present.  As  Respondent  was  routinely 
not  present,  which  required  others  to  cover  for  her,  the  children  in  her  advisory  class  did  not 
receive  the  same  experience  as  other  children  at  the  school. 

145. 

Witness  fra  Long,  a  resource  specialist  teacher  at  75th  Street  Elementary,  was 
highly  complimentary  of  Respondent’s  abilities,  but  noted  that  if'a 
resource  specialist  is  not 
present  for  the  child,  it  is  a  problem.  According  to  Mr.  Long,  “for  most  special  ed  students 
it’s  maintaining  routine”  that  is  key. 

interactions  with  Humanitas  Staff 

146. 

According  to  Principal  Navarro,  he  had  pulled  a  number  of  strings  to  be 

allowed  to  hire  Respondent  as  a  resource  specialist  as  she  had  a  previous  Below-Standards 
evaluation  at  75th  Elementary  School.  Humanitas  had  recently  lost  its  resource  specialist 
when  she  had  been  offered  a  promotion  at  another  location  and  Principal  Navarro  believed 
Respondent  to  be  the  perfect  fit  to  help  shape  the  special  education  department  at  Humanitas. 
Hired  at  the  same  time  with  Respondent  was  a  District  intern,  ChristiAnn  Marron. 

147. 

However,  despite  being  aware  that  most  of  the  teachers  at  Humanitas  had  a 
limited  understanding  of  the  special  education  system,  Respondent  did  little  to  educate  her 
peers  regardmg  the  process.  For  example,  AP  Aguilar  had  requested  Respondent  give  IEP 
team  members  a  10  day  notice  of  LEP  meetings.  Respondent  would  send  notifications  to 
partics  through  the  Welligent  system  despite  knowimg  that  AP  Aguilar  had  little  knowledge 
of  the  special  education  system  and  was  unfamiliar  with  the  system. 

148. 

Respondent  appears  to  have  had  particular  animosity  towards  AP  Aguilar. 

When  AP  Aguilar  would  attempt  to  counsel  Respondent  regarding  the  concerns  Humanitas 
had  regarding  her  conduct,  Respondent  failed  to  acknowledge  any  wrongdomeg.  Her 

26

responsive  memoranda,  in  particular,  would  focus  on  errors  she  perceived  AP  Aguiar  to  be 
making,  rather  than  following  admimistration’s  directives. 

LEGAL  CONCLUSIONS 

Jurisdiction 

1. 

The  Commission  has  jurisdiction  to  proceed  in  this  matter  under  Education 

Code  section  44944,  (Factual  Findings  1  through  3.) 

Burden  and  Standard  of  Proof 

2. 

In  this  case,  the  District  has  the  burden  of  proving  the  allegations  of  the 

Charges  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence.  (Gardner  v.  Commission  on  Professional 
Competence  (1983)  164  Cal  App.3d  1035,  1038-1039.)  Preponderance  of  the  evidence 
means  that  “the  evidence  on  [the  District’s]  side  outweighs,  preponderates  over,  is  more  than, 
the  evidence  on  the  other  side.”  (Glage  v.  Hawes  Firearms  Co,  (1990)  226  Cal  App.3d  314, 
325.) 

Statutory  Grounds  for  Dismissal 

3. 

The  governing  board  of  a  school  district  may  dismuss  a  permanent  certificated 

employee  if  one  or  more  of  the  causes  enumerated  in  Education  Cade  section  449372. 
subdivision  (a),  or  Education  Code  section  44939  is  established.  In  the  Statement  of  Charges, 
the  District  alleged  five  of  those  causes:  immoral  conduct,  dishonesty,  evident  unfitness  for 
service,  persistent  violation  of  school  laws  or  regulations,  and  willful  refusal  to  perform 
regular  assignments  without  reasonable  cause.  (Factual  Findmg  5.)  The  definitions  of  some 
of  those  causes  have  been  further  elucidated  by  the  courts  and  by  the  legislature. 

IMMORAL  CONDUCT 

4. 

“Immoral  conduct”  has  been  defined  to  mclude  conduct  inconsistent  with 

rectitude,  or  indicative  of  corruption,  indecency,  depravity,  dissoluteness,  or  as  willful, 
flagrant,  or  shameless  conduct  showing  moral  indifference  to  the  opmions  of  respectable 
members  of  the  community,  and  as  an  inconsiderate  attitude  toward  good  order  and  the 
public  welfare.  (Board  of  Ed.  of  San  Francisco  Unified  School  Dist.  v.  Weiland  (1960)  179 
Cal.  App.2d  808,  811.) 

UNPROFESSIONAL  CONDUCT 

5. 

“Unprofessional  conduct,”  as  used  im  section  44932,  subdivision  (a)(1),  is 

conduct  that  violates  the  rules  or  ethical  code  of  a  profession  or  that  is  unbecoming  a  member 
of  a  profession  in  good  standing.  (Board  of  Ed.  of  City  of  Los  Angeles  v.  Swan  (1953)  41 

27

Cal.  2d  546,  553  overruled  on  other  grounds  by  Bekiaris  v.  Board  of  Ed.  (1972)  6  Cal.3d 
575.)  The  conduct  in  question,  to  amount  to  unprofessional  conduct,  must  demonstrate 
unfitness  to  teach.  (Perez  v.  Commission  on  Professional  Competence  (1983)  149 
Cal  App.3d  1167,  1174.3 

LHSHONESTY 

6. 

“Dishonesty  necessarily  includes  the  element  of  bad  faith.  As  defined  in  the 

dictionaries  and  m  judicial  decisions,  tt  means  fraud,  deception,  betrayal,  farthiessness. 
iCitations.|  As  phrased  by  the  court  m  Alsup  v.  State,  91  Tex.  Cr.  224,  “dishonesty  denotes 
an  absence  of  integrity;  a  disposition  to  cheat,  deceive  or  defraud;  deceive  and  betray.’” 
(Hogg  v.  Real  Estate  Commissioner  (1942)  34  Cal  App.2d  712,  717) 

UNSATISFACTORY  PERFORMANCE 

7. 

“Unsatisfactory  performance’  is  not  defined  in  Education  Code  section  44932, 

subdivision  (a)(4),  but  the  term  is  not  intended  to  encompass  any  of  the  other  causes  for 
dismissal  specified  in  section  44932.  (Ed.  Code,  §  44938,  subd.  (c).)  “Unsatisfactory 
performance’  generally  denotes  a  failure  to  meet  reasonable  teaching  standards.  School 
districts  establish  requirements  for  all  teachers  concerning  fundamental  duties  such  as 
attendance,  adherence  to  adopted  curriculum  and  methodology,  presentation  of  classroom 
imstruction,  engagement  of  students,  and  professional  development.  These  requirements  serve 
as  the  standards  by  which  teaching  performance  is  measured.  (See  Perez  v.  Commission  on 
Professional  Competence  (1983)  149  Cal  App.3d  1167,  L174.) 

EVIDENT  UNFITNESS  FOR  SERVICE 

8. 

Evident  unfitness  for  service  is  established  by  conduct  demonstrating  that  the 

teacher  is  “clearly  not  fit,  not  adapted  or  suitable  for  teaching,  ordinarily  by  reason  of 
temperamental  defects  or  inadequacies.”  (Woodland  Joint  Unified  School  Dist.  v. 
Commission  on  Professional  Competence  (1992)  2  Cal  App.4th  1429,  1444  (Woodland).) 
“Evident  unfitness  for  service’  connotes  a  fixed  character  trait,  presumably  not  remediable 
merely  on  receipt  of  notice  that  one’s  conduct  fails  to  meet  the  expectations  of  the  employing 
school  district.”  Ud.) 

PERSISTENT  VIOLATION  OF  SCHOOL  LAWS  OR  REGULATIONS 

9, 

To  establish  cause  for  discipline  based  on  the  violation  of school  rules,  there 
must  be  a  “showing  of  intentional  and  continual  refusal  to  cooperate.”  (San  Diesuito  Union 
High  School  Dist.  v.  Commission  on  Professional  Competence  (1985)  174  Cal  App.3d  1176, 
1196.)  The  violation  must  be  persistent  or  “motivated  by  an  attitude  of  continuous 
msubordination.”  (Governing  Bd.  of  the  Oakdale  Union  School  Dist.  v.  Seaman  (A972)  28 
Cal.  App.3d  77,  81-82.)  Isolated  events  or  incidents  involving  an  issue  unresolved  over  4 
period  of  time  are  generally  not  considered  persistent.  (Bourland  vy.  Commission  on 
Professional  Competence  (1985)  174  Cal  App.3d  317  (Bouriand).) 

28

WILLFUL  REFUSAL  TO  PERFORM  REGULAR  ASSIGNMENTS  WITHOUT  REASONABLE 

CAUSE 

10. 

The  plain  meaning  of  this  cause  for  dismissal  under  Education  Code  section 

44939,  subdivision  (b),  applies.  (See  Board  of  Education  of  City  of  Los  Angeles  v.  Swan 
(1953)  41  Cal.2d  546,  556  [teacher  who  declined  to  accept  teaching  assignments  subject  to 
dismissal ].) 

The  Morrison  Factors 

11. 

To  determine  whether  there  is  cause  for  dismissal  under  section  44932, 

subdivision  (a),  based  on  immoral  conduct  or  evident  unfitness  for  service  as  alleged  here, 
the  Commission  must  evaluate  whether  the  teacher’s  alleged  misconduct  demonstrates  the 
teacher’s  unfitness  for  service  using  factors  that  the  Supreme  Court  enunciated  in  Morrison 
v.  State  Board  of  Education  (1969)  1  Cal.3d  214,  227-230  (Morrison). 

12. 

The  Morrison  factors  are:  the  likelihood  that  the  conduct  had  or  may  have  an 
adverse  effect  on  students  or  fellow  teachers;  the  degree  of  the  adverse  effect;  the  proximity 
or  remoteness  in  time  of  the  conduct;  the  type  of  teaching  certificate  held  by  the  party 
involved;  extenuating  or  aggravating  circumstances,  if  any,  surrounding  the  conduct;  the 
praiseworthiness  or  blameworthiness  of  the  motives  resulting  in  the  conduct;  the  likelihood 
of  recurrence  of  the  questioned  conduct;  and  the  extent  to  which  disciplinary  action  may 
inflict  an  adverse  impact  or  chilling  effect  upon  the  constitutional  rights  of  the  teacher 
involved  or  other  teachers.’ 

13. 

|  The  Morrison  court  held  that  “an  individual  can  be  removed  from  the  teaching 
profession  only  upon  a  showing  that  his  retention  in  the  profession  poses  a  significant  danger 
of  harm  to  students,  school  employees,  or  others  who  might  be  affected  by  his  actions  as  a 
teacher.”  Ud.,  at  p.  235;  see  also  Fontana  Unified  School  Dist.  v.  Burman  (1988)  45  Cal.3d 
208  (Fontana);  Woodland,  supra,  4  Cal.App.4th  at  pp.  1444-1445;  Bourland,  supra,  174 
Cal.App.3d  at  p.  321.) 

14. 

~~  Not  all  Morrison  factors  need  be  present  for  the  Morrison  test  to  be  satisfied. 

(Governing  Bd.  v.  Haar  (1994)  28  Cal.App.4th  369.)  Nor  must  the  Morrison  analysis  be 
conducted  on  each  individual  fact  established;  it  may  be  applied  to  the  accumulated  facts 
established  collectively.  (Woodland,  supra,  2  Cal.App.4th  at  p.  1457.) 

/// 

/// 

  

”  There  is  no  reason  to  apply  the  Morrison  factors  to  analyze  causes  for  dismissal  for 

persistent  violation  of  laws  and  regulations  (Morrison,  supra,  |  Cal.3d  at  pp.  227-230),  or  for 
willful  refusal  to  perform  regular  assignments  without  reasonable  cause.  It  may  be  presumed 
that  such  conduct  1s  related  to  fitness  to  teach. 

29

Analysis 

1S. 

In  the  Statement  of  Charges,  the  District  alleged  seven  of  those  causes: 

immoral  conduct,  unprofessional  conduct,  dishonesty,  unsatisfactory  performance,  evident 
unfitness  for  service,  persistent  violation  of  school  laws  or  regulations,  and  willful  refusal  to 
perform  regular  assignments  without  reasonable  cause.  The  Commission  exammed  cach 
charged  act  to  determine  whether  it  was  proven.  For  cach  charged  act  proven,  the 
Commission  considered  whether  the  act  supported  one  or  more  of  the  statutory  bases  for 
dismissal  as  alleged,  and  applied  the  Morrison  factors  where  appropriate. 

16. 

The  District  argues  that  Respondent’s  conduct  with  fellow  teachers  and  staff 

and  falsifying  records  was  immoral  and  dishonest,  pointing  to  three  separate  incidents,  as 
follows: 

a. 

The  District  alleges  that  Respondent  falsely  claimed  that  her  January 
23,  2017,  absence  was  for  an  LEP  meeting  for  her  daughter.  This  allegation,  which  was  not 
alleged  in  the  Statement  of  Charges,  however,  was  not  proven.  As  demonstrated  by  the 
March  9,  2017  letter  from  Clover  Avenue,  Respondent  had,  im  fact,  attended  an  IEP  on  that 
date.  (Exhibit  540,  TSC  043.) 

b. 

The  District  has  also  argued  that  Respondent’s  failure  to  complete  the 

30  chaperone  hours  constituted  immoral  and  dishonest  conduct.  Though  the  District  did 
prove  that  Respondent  failed  to  complete  her  30  chaperone  hours,  the  District’s  allegation 
that  this  failure  constituted  “immoral  conduct”  is  nonsensical.  It  was  also  established  that 
Respondent  claimed  credit  for  ttems  which  ultimately  did  not  count  towards  her  chaperone 
hours,  however,  the  District  failed  to  show  that  Respondent  had  been  dishonest  for  doing  so. 
For  example,  though  Respondent  claimed  credit  for  a  field  trip  she  did  not  attend, 
Respondent  testified  that  she  felt  she  could  appropriately  claim  credit  for  the  trip  as  she  spent 
time  planning  the  trip  and  the  only  reason  she  did  not  go  on  the  trip  was  in  order  to  attend  an 
emergency  IEP  meeting.  Respondent  further  documented  that  Ms.  Marron  had  attended  the 
field  trip  in  her  place. 

C, 

The  District  has  also  claumed  that  Respondent’s  failure  to  attend  the 

June  2016  summer  retreat  constituted  immoral  and  dishonest  conduct.  According  to 
Respondent,  she  did  not  attend  the  retreat  as  she  wanted  to  spend  time  with  her  family  after 
her  uncle’s  passing.  The  District  did  not  present  any  evidence  which  would  contradict  that 
statement.  The  fact  that  Respondent  did  not  know  the  limitations  on  the  use  of  bereavement 
leave  and  attempted  to  use  that  leave  does  not  constitute  either  mmmoral  or  dishonest  conduct. 

17. 

Finally,  though  it  was  established  that  Respondent  had  difficult  relationships 

with  some  ofthe  staff  and  administration,  it  cannot  be  said  having  difficult  relationships  with 
staff  and  administration,  without  more,  1s  immoral  or  dishonest  in  nature.

Cause  therefore  docs  not  exist  to  dismiss  Respondent  from  her  employment 

pursuant  to  Education  Code  section  44932,  subdivision  (a)(  1},  Education  Code  section 
44939,  and  Education  Code  section  44932,  subdivision  (a)(4).}

regulations  prescribed  for  the  government  of  the  public  schools  by  the  governing  board  of  the 
school  district  employing  her,  as  set  forth  in  Factual  Findings  4  through  40,  42  through  43, 
45  through  60,  69,  71  through  73,  75  through  114,  117,  119  through  120,  122,  125,  132,  136 
through  140,  142  through  145,  and  Legal  Conclusions  2,  9,  Lt  through  15. 

23. 

Cause  for  dismissal  of  Respondent  exists  under  Education  Code  section 

44939,  based  on  willful  refusal  to  perform  regular  assignments  without  reasonable  cause,  as 
set  forth  m  Factual  Findings  4  through  40,  42  through  43,  45  through  60,  69,  71  through  73,

Legal  Conclusions  2,  10  through  15. 

24. 

Even  where,  as  here,  a  school  district  has  established  cause  for  dismissal,  the 

Commission  has  broad  discretion  to  determine  whether  dismissal  is  warranted.  (Fontana, 
supra,  45  Cal.3d  at  pp.  220-222.)  “The  Commission  has  broad  discretion  in  determining 
what  constitutes  unfitness  to  teach...  ,  and  whether  dismissal  or  suspension  is  the 
appropriate  sanction.  [Citing  Fontana.)  “{A|  discrplimary  discharge  often  involves  complex 
facts  and  may  require  a  sensitive  evaluation  of  the  nature  and  seriousness  of  the  misconduct 
and  whether  it  warrants  the  prave  sanction  of  dismissal.’  [Citation |.”  (California  Teachers 
Assn.  v.  State  of  California  (1999)  20  Cal.  4th  327,  343-344)

25. 

Dismissal  is  warranted  in  this  case  in  order  to  protect  students  and  others  from 

the  adverse  consequences  of  Respondent’s  actions  in  view  of  the  persistent  and  serious 
nature  of  Respondent’s  misconduct  and  tn  order  to  protect  students  and  others  from  the 
likehhoad  that  Respondent  will  continue  to  engage  in  similar  conduct  in  the  future. 

ORDER 

The  dismissal  of  Respondent  John  Sandy  Campbell  from  employment  with  the  Los 

Unified  School  District  is  sustained.
